    "Reason": "The 'threads' configuration option in the sunflow software project is performance-sensitive because changing the number of threads can significantly impact system performance. Increasing the number of threads can lead to better parallel processing and faster execution times, while decreasing the number of threads can result in slower performance due to less parallelism and resource utilization."
