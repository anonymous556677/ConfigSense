    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'depths.reflection' configuration option in the 'sunflow' software project is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the rendering quality and complexity of reflective surfaces in the scene. Changing the value of this configuration can significantly affect the rendering time and memory consumption, especially in scenes with a high level of reflection. Therefore, any variations in the 'depths.reflection' value can lead to notable variations in system performance, making it a performance-sensitive configuration."
