    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'depths.diffuse' configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly affects the accuracy and quality of light ray tracing calculations in the system. The code snippet related to the 'depths.diffuse' configuration involves time-expensive operations such as counting total number of light samples and initializing the GI engine, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Additionally, setting a higher value for 'depths.diffuse' may result in slower rendering, indicating a substantial impact on system performance."
