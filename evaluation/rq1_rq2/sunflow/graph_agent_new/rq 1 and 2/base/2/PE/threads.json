    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'threads' configuration is performance-sensitive. This is because the 'threads' configuration directly affects the parallelism level for rendering, which can have a significant impact on system performance. Setting the number of threads too high can lead to increased resource consumption and potential performance bottlenecks. Additionally, the 'threads' configuration is directly related to time-expensive operations such as rendering, where the number of threads can greatly influence the execution time of the rendering process. Therefore, the 'threads' configuration can lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
