    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'depths.reflection' configuration option is performance-sensitive. This is because the 'maxReflectionDepth' variable directly affects the maximum depth for reflection rays in the rendering process, which can have a significant impact on rendering time and memory usage at the system level. The code snippet also performs validation and initialization based on this configuration option, indicating its importance in the performance of the system."
