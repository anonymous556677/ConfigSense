    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'depths.refraction' configuration option is classified as performance-sensitive. This is because the value of 'maxRefractionDepth' directly impacts the maximum depth of refraction rays that can be traced in the system, affecting how transparent materials are rendered and potentially impacting the realism of the rendered scenes. Additionally, the code snippet related to this configuration reads and assigns the value, performs validation, and is triggered during the 'build' process, indicating its importance in the system's performance."
