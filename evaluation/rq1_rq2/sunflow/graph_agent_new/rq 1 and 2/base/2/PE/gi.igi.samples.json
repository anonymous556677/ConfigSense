    "Reason": "The configuration option 'gi.igi.samples' is not performance-sensitive. The code snippet provided shows that it simply retrieves an integer value from the Options object and assigns it to the numPhotons variable. This operation is not time-expensive or memory-expensive, and it does not directly and substantially affect system performance at the system level. Additionally, the developer's explanation indicates that the impact of this configuration is on the quality of the global illumination effect rather than on system performance."
