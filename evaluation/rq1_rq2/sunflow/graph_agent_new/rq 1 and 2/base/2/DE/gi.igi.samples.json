    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The configuration 'gi.igi.samples' is triggered whenever an InstantGI object is created with the corresponding Options object. The frequency of triggering depends on how often InstantGI objects are instantiated in the system.",

Setting a higher value for numPhotons may result in more accurate and detailed global illumination, but it can also increase the computational cost and memory usage."
