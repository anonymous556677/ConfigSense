    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'depths.reflection' configuration is performance-sensitive. This is because the 'maxReflectionDepth' value set by this configuration directly impacts the rendering process by determining the maximum reflection depth. This value is crucial for rendering quality and can significantly affect the performance of the rendering engine. Additionally, the configuration involves time-expensive operations such as initializing the GI engine and handling caustics photon map, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
