    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'depths.refraction' configuration option is performance-sensitive. This is because changing the 'maxRefractionDepth' value directly impacts the maximum depth allowed for refraction rays in the rendering process. This change can significantly affect the quality of refraction effects in the rendered images, as well as the memory usage and performance of the rendering engine. The code snippet related to this configuration reads and sets the 'maxRefractionDepth' variable, which is a performance-related operation contributing to execution time and memory consumption. Therefore, the configuration directly and substantially affects system performance at the system level, making it performance-sensitive."
