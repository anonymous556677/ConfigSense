    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'bucket.size' configuration is performance-sensitive. This is because the bucket size directly impacts the number of buckets used for rendering the scene, which can have a significant effect on performance at the system level. The code related to the 'bucket.size' configuration involves clamping the size, computing the number of buckets, and setting up anti-aliasing parameters, all of which are time-expensive operations that can lead to notable performance variations."
