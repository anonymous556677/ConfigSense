    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'gi.igi.samples' is classified as performance-sensitive. This is because the 'gi.igi.samples' configuration directly impacts the number of photons used for InstantGI calculations, which can significantly affect the computation time and memory usage at the system level. The code snippet provided shows that the value for 'gi.igi.samples' is retrieved from the Options object during the instantiation of InstantGI, indicating that it is a critical parameter for the performance of the InstantGI module. Therefore, any changes in the value of 'gi.igi.samples' can lead to notable performance variations, making it performance-sensitive."
