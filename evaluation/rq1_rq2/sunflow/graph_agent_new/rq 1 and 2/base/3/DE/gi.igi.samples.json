    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The configuration 'gi.igi.samples' is used in the code to set the number of photons for InstantGI. It retrieves the integer value associated with the key 'gi.igi.samples' from the Options object passed to the InstantGI constructor.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The triggering frequency of the 'gi.igi.samples' configuration depends on how often the InstantGI class is instantiated with different Options objects that contain this configuration key. It is triggered whenever a new InstantGI object is created with a specific value for the 'gi.igi.samples' configuration.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the 'gi.igi.samples' configuration option is significant as it directly affects the quality of global illumination in the system. A higher number of photons can result in better lighting and more accurate rendering, but it also increases computational cost and memory usage."
