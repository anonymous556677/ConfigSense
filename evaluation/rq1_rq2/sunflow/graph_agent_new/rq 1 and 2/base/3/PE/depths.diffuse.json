    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'depths.diffuse' is performance-sensitive. This is because the 'maxDiffuseDepth' variable directly impacts the maximum depth of diffuse light rays that can be traced in the system. Setting a higher value for 'maxDiffuseDepth' can increase the accuracy of diffuse lighting calculations but may also increase computational overhead. The code snippet that reads and sets the 'maxDiffuseDepth' value is time-expensive as it involves calculations and validations. Additionally, the configuration is triggered during the initialization or setup phase of the system, indicating its importance in system performance. Therefore, the configuration is considered performance-sensitive due to its direct and substantial effect on system performance at the system level."
