    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'depths.reflection' is performance-sensitive. This is because the 'maxReflectionDepth' variable directly affects the rendering process by controlling the maximum reflection depth. Setting a higher value for 'maxReflectionDepth' can significantly impact rendering time and memory usage, leading to notable performance variations at the system level. Additionally, the code snippet that sets and validates the 'maxReflectionDepth' variable is time-expensive as it involves multiple calculations and iterations, contributing to the performance sensitivity of the configuration."
