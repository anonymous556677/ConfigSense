    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'depths.refraction' configuration option is performance-sensitive. This is because the value set for 'maxRefractionDepth' directly impacts the rendering process by determining the maximum depth for refraction rays. If this value is set too high, it can significantly increase the computational load and memory usage of the system, leading to notable performance variations. Additionally, the code snippet performs validations and initializations related to this configuration, indicating its importance in the system's performance."
