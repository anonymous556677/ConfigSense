    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'threads' configuration is performance-sensitive. Setting the number of threads directly impacts the rendering performance and speed of the system at the system level. By adjusting the number of threads, the system can utilize multiple cores for rendering, potentially improving rendering efficiency and reducing rendering time. The 'threads' configuration directly influences the execution time and resource utilization during the rendering process, leading to notable performance variations at the system level."
