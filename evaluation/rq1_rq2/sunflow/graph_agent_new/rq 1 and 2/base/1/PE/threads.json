    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'threads' configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly affects the parallelism level of the rendering process, which can have a significant impact on system performance. Setting the number of threads too high can lead to increased resource usage and potential synchronization overhead, while setting it too low may not fully utilize the available resources. The configuration is directly related to time-expensive and memory-expensive operations within the rendering code, as it determines the level of concurrency in rendering, which can result in notable performance variations at the system level."
