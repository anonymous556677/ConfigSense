    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'depths.reflection' configuration is classified as performance-sensitive. This is because the 'maxReflectionDepth' variable directly affects the behavior of the system by setting the maximum depth for reflection rays. This parameter impacts the accuracy and realism of rendered images, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Additionally, the configuration-related code performs validation and initialization based on this configuration, indicating that it has a significant impact on system performance."
