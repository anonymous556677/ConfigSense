    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'depths.refraction' configuration option is performance-sensitive because it directly affects the maximum depth for refraction rays in the rendering process, which can significantly impact the computational cost and rendering time. The code snippet related to this configuration performs operations such as initializing the GI engine and calculating photons based on the 'maxRefractionDepth' value, which are time-expensive and memory-expensive operations contributing to notable performance variations at the system level."
