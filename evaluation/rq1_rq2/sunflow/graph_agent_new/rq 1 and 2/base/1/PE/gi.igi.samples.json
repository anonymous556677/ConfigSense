    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'gi.igi.samples' configuration is performance-sensitive. The code snippet provided shows that this configuration determines the number of photons used for InstantGI calculations, which directly impacts the quality and performance of global illumination in the system. Adjusting the number of photons can have a significant performance impact, as it affects the computational load and memory usage during the rendering process. Therefore, any changes to this configuration can lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
