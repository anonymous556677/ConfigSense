    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'depths.diffuse' is performance-sensitive because it directly affects the maximum depth for diffuse rays in the rendering process. Setting a higher value for 'maxDiffuseDepth' can lead to more accurate lighting calculations but could also increase rendering time and memory usage. The code snippet related to the configuration involves time-expensive operations such as initializing the GI engine, calculating photons for caustics, and performing validation on depth values. These operations can have a notable performance impact at the system level, making the configuration performance-sensitive."
