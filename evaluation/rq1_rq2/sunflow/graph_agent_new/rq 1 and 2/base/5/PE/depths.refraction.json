    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'depths.refraction' configuration option is classified as performance-sensitive. This classification is based on the fact that the 'maxRefractionDepth' value directly impacts the quality and accuracy of the rendered images, which can significantly affect the system's performance at the rendering level. The code snippet related to this configuration involves setting and validating the 'maxRefractionDepth' value, which is a time-expensive operation contributing to the overall execution time of the rendering process. Additionally, the 'depths.refraction' configuration triggers whenever the rendering process requires setting the maximum refraction depth, indicating its importance in the performance of the system."
