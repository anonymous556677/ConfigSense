    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The 'gi.igi.samples' configuration option is not performance-sensitive based on the provided code context and developer information. The configuration is simply used to set the number of photons in the InstantGI constructor, which does not involve any time-expensive or memory-expensive operations. Additionally, the impact of this configuration is on the quality of global illumination rather than directly affecting system performance at the system level. Therefore, it does not lead to notable performance variations and should be classified as not performance-sensitive."
