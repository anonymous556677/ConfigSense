    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'depths.reflection' is performance-sensitive. This is because the 'maxReflectionDepth' value directly impacts the quality of reflections in the rendered images, which can significantly affect the rendering time and computational cost at the system level. The code snippet related to this configuration involves calculations and initializations that contribute to the execution time and memory consumption, such as handling different cases for caustics photon map engine, validating options, performing calculations related to light samples and GI engine, and caching. These operations are time-expensive and memory-expensive, leading to notable performance variations in the system."
