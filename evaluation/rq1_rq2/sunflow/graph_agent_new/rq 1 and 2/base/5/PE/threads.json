    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'threads' configuration is performance-sensitive. This is because the 'threads' configuration directly affects the number of threads used for rendering, which can have a significant impact on system performance at the system level. Setting a higher number of threads can potentially improve rendering performance, but may also increase resource usage and potentially introduce thread-related issues. Additionally, the code snippet related to the 'threads' configuration involves time-expensive operations such as setting the number of threads for rendering, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
