    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The triggering frequency of the 'gi.igi.samples' configuration depends on how often the InstantGI constructor is called in the system. If the constructor is called multiple times with different values for 'gi.igi.samples', then the configuration will be triggered multiple times.",

Setting a higher value for 'gi.igi.samples' will result in more accurate and smoother global illumination, but it may also increase the computational cost and rendering time."
