    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'depths.diffuse' is performance-sensitive. The code snippet related to this configuration involves operations that contribute to execution time and memory consumption, such as reading and validating options, initializing the GI engine, calculating photons, and clearing shading cache. These operations directly impact system performance by affecting the number of light samples, initializing the GI engine, and managing cache entries. Additionally, the 'depths.diffuse' configuration directly influences the max raytrace depth for diffuse lighting, which can significantly impact rendering performance at the system level."
