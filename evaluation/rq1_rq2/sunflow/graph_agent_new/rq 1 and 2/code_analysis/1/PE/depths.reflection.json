    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'depths.reflection' configuration option is performance-sensitive. This is because the 'maxReflectionDepth' value set based on this configuration directly affects the maximum raytrace depth for reflection in the system, which can significantly impact the performance of the rendering process. The code snippet related to this configuration involves operations that contribute to execution time and memory consumption, such as initializing the GI engine, calculating photons, and clearing shading cache. These operations are time-expensive and memory-expensive, leading to notable performance variations at the system level."
