    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'depths.refraction' is performance-sensitive. This is because the 'maxRefractionDepth' value set by this configuration directly affects the maximum raytrace depth for refraction calculations, which can significantly impact the performance of the rendering system. The code snippet shows that the 'maxRefractionDepth' value is used in various calculations and validations that are critical for the rendering process. Additionally, the 'create' method for GIEngine objects is related to this configuration option, further emphasizing its performance sensitivity."
