    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'depths.refraction' is performance-sensitive. This is because the 'maxRefractionDepth' parameter is directly read and used in the code context, affecting the maximum raytrace depth for refraction calculations. The 'maxRefractionDepth' parameter is a critical factor that can significantly impact the performance of the rendering engine at the system level, as it determines the complexity and accuracy of refraction effects in the scene. Therefore, any changes to the 'depths.refraction' configuration can lead to notable performance variations in the rendering process, making it a performance-sensitive configuration."
