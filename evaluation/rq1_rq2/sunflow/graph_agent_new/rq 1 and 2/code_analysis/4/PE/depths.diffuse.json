    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'depths.diffuse' is performance-sensitive. This is because the 'maxDiffuseDepth' value set by this configuration directly affects the total number of light samples calculated in the 'build' method. The 'maxDiffuseDepth' value is used in a loop to iterate through the lights array and calculate the number of light samples, which contributes to the execution time and memory consumption of the system. Therefore, changes in the 'depths.diffuse' configuration can lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
