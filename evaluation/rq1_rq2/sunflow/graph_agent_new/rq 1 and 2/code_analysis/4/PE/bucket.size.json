    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'bucket.size' is performance-sensitive. This is because the 'bucket.size' configuration directly affects the number of buckets in each direction, which in turn impacts the rendering process. The code snippet related to 'bucket.size' involves operations such as clamping the bucket size, computing the number of buckets, and setting various parameters related to anti-aliasing and filtering. These operations are time-expensive and memory-expensive, leading to notable performance variations at the system level."
