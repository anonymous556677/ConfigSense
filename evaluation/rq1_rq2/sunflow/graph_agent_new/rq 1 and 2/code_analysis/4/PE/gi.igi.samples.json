    "Reason": "The configuration option 'gi.igi.samples' is not performance-sensitive. The code snippet provided shows that this configuration is simply used to set the number of photons, which does not involve any time-expensive or memory-expensive operations. Additionally, setting the number of photons is unlikely to have a substantial impact on system performance at the system level."
