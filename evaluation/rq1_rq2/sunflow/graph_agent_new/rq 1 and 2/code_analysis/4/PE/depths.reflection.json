    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'depths.reflection' is performance-sensitive. This is because the 'maxReflectionDepth' value set by this configuration directly affects the maximum raytrace depth for reflection in the rendering process. The code snippet shows that the 'maxReflectionDepth' value is read from the configuration and used in various calculations and initializations that impact the rendering performance. Additionally, the 'GIEngine' creation process is dependent on the 'gi.engine' option provided in the configuration, which further emphasizes the performance sensitivity of this configuration."
