    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'threads' configuration option is performance-sensitive. This is because the 'threads' configuration directly affects the number of threads used for rendering, which can have a significant impact on performance. The code snippet shows that the 'threads' configuration is read from options and used to set the number of threads. The number of threads can greatly influence the rendering speed and efficiency of the system, making this configuration performance-sensitive at the system level."
