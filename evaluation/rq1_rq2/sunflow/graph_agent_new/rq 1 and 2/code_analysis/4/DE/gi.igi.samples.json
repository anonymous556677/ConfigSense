    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The triggering frequency of the 'gi.igi.samples' configuration depends on when the InstantGI object is instantiated with the 'Options' object. If the 'gi.igi.samples' configuration is specified in the 'Options' object during instantiation, it will be triggered at that point.",

A higher value for 'gi.igi.samples' will result in more accurate global illumination but may also increase computation time and memory usage."
