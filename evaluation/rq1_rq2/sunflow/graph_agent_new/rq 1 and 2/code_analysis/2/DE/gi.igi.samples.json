    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The configuration 'gi.igi.samples' is used in the code to set the number of photons for InstantGI. It retrieves the integer value associated with the key 'gi.igi.samples' from the Options object passed to the InstantGI constructor.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The triggering frequency of the 'gi.igi.samples' configuration depends on how often the InstantGI class is instantiated with different Options objects that have a value set for 'gi.igi.samples'. It is triggered whenever a new InstantGI object is created with a specific value for 'gi.igi.samples'.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the 'gi.igi.samples' configuration option on the system is that it determines the number of photons used for InstantGI, which can affect the quality of global illumination in the rendered scene. A higher value for 'gi.igi.samples' may result in better quality but also increase computational overhead."
