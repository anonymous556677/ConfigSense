{
    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'depths.refraction' is performance-sensitive. This classification is based on the fact that the 'maxRefractionDepth' configuration parameter directly affects the performance of the rendering system by controlling the maximum depth of refraction rays. This parameter is used in various calculations and validations within the 'build' method, impacting the number of calculations and memory usage. Additionally, the method 'create' related to the GIEngine creation is indirectly linked to the configuration option, as it reads the 'gi.engine' option from the configuration, further emphasizing the performance impact of the 'depths.refraction' configuration."
