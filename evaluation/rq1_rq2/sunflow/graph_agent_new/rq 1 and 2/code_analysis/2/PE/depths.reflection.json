    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'depths.reflection' is performance-sensitive. This is because the 'maxReflectionDepth' configuration parameter directly affects the maximum raytrace depth for reflection calculations, which can significantly impact the performance of the system. The code snippet related to this configuration involves operations that contribute to execution time and memory consumption, such as initializing the GI engine, calculating photons, and clearing the shading cache. These operations are time-expensive and memory-expensive, leading to notable performance variations at the system level."
