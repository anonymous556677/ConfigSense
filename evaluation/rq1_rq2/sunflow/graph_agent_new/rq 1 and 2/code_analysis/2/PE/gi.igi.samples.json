    "Reason": "The configuration option 'gi.igi.samples' is not performance-sensitive. The code snippet provided shows that this configuration is simply initializing a variable 'numPhotons' with a value from the options. There are no performance-related operations within this code snippet that would lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Therefore, this configuration is not considered performance-sensitive."
