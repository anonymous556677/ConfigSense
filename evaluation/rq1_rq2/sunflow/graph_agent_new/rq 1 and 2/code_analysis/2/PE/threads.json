    "Reason": "The 'threads' configuration option is performance-sensitive. This is because the 'threads' configuration directly affects the number of threads used for rendering, which can have a significant impact on performance. The code snippet related to the 'threads' configuration shows that it is used to set the number of threads for rendering, which can affect the overall execution time and memory consumption of the system. Additionally, the 'threads' configuration is crucial for parallel processing and can lead to notable performance variations at the system level depending on the number of threads set."
