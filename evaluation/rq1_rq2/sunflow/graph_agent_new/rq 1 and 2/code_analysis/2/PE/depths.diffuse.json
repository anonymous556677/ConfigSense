    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'depths.diffuse' is performance-sensitive. This is because the 'maxDiffuseDepth' value set by the 'depths.diffuse' configuration directly affects the number of light samples calculated in the 'build' method. The calculation of light samples contributes to the execution time and memory consumption of the system. Additionally, the 'giEngine' initialization and the 'calculatePhotons' method called with 'causticPhotonMap' configuration involve time-expensive operations within the related code, leading to notable performance variations at the system level."
