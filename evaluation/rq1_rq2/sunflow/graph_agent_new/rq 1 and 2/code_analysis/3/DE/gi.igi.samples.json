    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The triggering frequency of the 'gi.igi.samples' configuration depends on how often the InstantGI class is instantiated with new options. It will be triggered whenever a new InstantGI object is created with the 'gi.igi.samples' configuration specified.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the 'gi.igi.samples' configuration option is significant as it directly affects the quality of global illumination in the system. Setting a higher value for 'gi.igi.samples' will result in more accurate and smoother global illumination, but it will also increase the computational cost and render time."
