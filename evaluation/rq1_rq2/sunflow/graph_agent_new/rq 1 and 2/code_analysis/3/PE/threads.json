    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'threads' configuration option is performance-sensitive. This is because the 'threads' configuration directly affects the number of threads used for rendering, which can have a significant impact on performance at the system level. The code snippet related to the 'threads' configuration shows that it is used to set the number of threads for rendering, which can affect the overall rendering speed and efficiency. Additionally, the 'threads' configuration is time-expensive as it involves setting up and managing multiple threads for rendering, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
