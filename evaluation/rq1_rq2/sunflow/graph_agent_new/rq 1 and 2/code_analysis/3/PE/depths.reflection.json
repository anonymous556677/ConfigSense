    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'depths.reflection' is not performance-sensitive. The code snippet related to this configuration does not contain any time-expensive or memory-expensive operations that would lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The configuration is simply reading an integer value from the options and setting it to 'maxReflectionDepth'. The validation and initialization operations performed on this configuration are standard and do not have a significant impact on system performance."
