    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'gi.igi.samples' is not performance-sensitive. This is because the code snippet related to this configuration simply initializes a variable 'numPhotons' based on the value obtained from the 'gi.igi.samples' configuration. The operation of getting an integer value from the configuration does not involve any time-expensive or memory-expensive operations that would lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Therefore, this configuration does not directly and substantially affect system performance."
