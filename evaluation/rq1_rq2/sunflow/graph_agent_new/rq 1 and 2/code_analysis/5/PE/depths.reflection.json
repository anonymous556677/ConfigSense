    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'depths.reflection' is not performance-sensitive. This is because the code related to this configuration does not involve any performance-related operations that are time-expensive or memory-expensive. The 'depths.reflection' configuration is simply read from the options and used to set the 'maxReflectionDepth' variable. The validation and usage of this configuration do not have a significant impact on system performance at the system level. Therefore, it can be classified as not performance-sensitive."
