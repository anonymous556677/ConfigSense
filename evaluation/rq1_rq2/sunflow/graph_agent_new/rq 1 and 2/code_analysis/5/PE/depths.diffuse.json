    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'depths.diffuse' is performance-sensitive. This is because the 'maxDiffuseDepth' parameter is read from this configuration and used to set the maximum diffuse depth in the rendering process. The 'maxDiffuseDepth' parameter directly affects the number of light samples and the raytrace depth, which are time-expensive operations. Changing the 'depths.diffuse' configuration can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, making it performance-sensitive."
