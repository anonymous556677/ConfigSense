    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'gi.igi.samples' is not performance-sensitive. This is because the code snippet related to this configuration does not involve any performance-intensive operations that would lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The configuration simply initializes a variable with an integer value, which is not time-expensive or memory-expensive. Therefore, it does not directly and substantially affect system performance."
