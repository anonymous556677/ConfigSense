    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'bucket.size' configuration option is performance-sensitive. This is because the 'bucket.size' configuration directly affects the number of buckets in each direction, which in turn impacts the anti-aliasing calculations, subpixel jitter, and contrast thresholds. These calculations involve time-expensive operations such as clamping values, computing stepping sizes, and generating QMC sampling tables. The 'bucket.size' configuration also influences the resolution of the image and the number of rays per sample, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
