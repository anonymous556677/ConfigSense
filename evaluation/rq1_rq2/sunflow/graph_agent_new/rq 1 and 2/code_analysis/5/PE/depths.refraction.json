    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'depths.refraction' configuration option is performance-sensitive. This is because the 'maxRefractionDepth' variable is directly assigned the value of the 'depths.refraction' configuration option, which is then used in various calculations and validations within the 'build' method. The 'maxRefractionDepth' variable is used to set the maximum depth for refraction calculations, which can significantly impact the performance of the rendering engine. Additionally, the method 'create' is related to the configuration option as it reads the 'gi.engine' configuration option to determine which type of GI engine to create, further emphasizing the performance sensitivity of the 'depths.refraction' configuration option."
