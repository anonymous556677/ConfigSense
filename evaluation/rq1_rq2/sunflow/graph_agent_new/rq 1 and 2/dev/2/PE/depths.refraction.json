    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'depths.refraction' configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the rendering process by controlling the maximum refraction depth. This configuration involves performance-related operations such as validation, calculations, and rendering, which are time-expensive and memory-expensive. A higher value of 'depths.refraction' can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, affecting rendering time and resource usage significantly."
