    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'gi.igi.samples' configuration option is performance-sensitive. This is because the number of photons set by this configuration directly impacts the computation time and memory usage of InstantGI calculations. Higher values can lead to better quality but also increase the performance overhead significantly. The configuration involves performance-related operations (InstantGI calculations) that are time-expensive and memory-expensive, resulting in notable performance variations at the system level."
