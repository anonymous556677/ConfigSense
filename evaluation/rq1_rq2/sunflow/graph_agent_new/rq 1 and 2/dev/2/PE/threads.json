    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'threads' configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly affects the system performance at the system level. The number of threads specified in this configuration impacts the parallel processing of rendering tasks, which can significantly affect the rendering process. Setting a higher number of threads can speed up the rendering process by utilizing more CPU cores, but setting too many threads can lead to resource contention and overhead, negatively impacting the overall performance. Therefore, the 'threads' configuration can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, making it performance-sensitive."
