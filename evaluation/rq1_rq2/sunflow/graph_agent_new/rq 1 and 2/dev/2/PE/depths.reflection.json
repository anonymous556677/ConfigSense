    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'depths.reflection' configuration is considered performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the behavior of the system at the system level by setting the maximum reflection depth. This affects how light rays are traced and reflected within the scene, leading to potential variations in computational complexity and render time. Additionally, the configuration involves setting a parameter that can contribute to time-expensive operations within its related code, which can result in notable performance variations."
