    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'depths.refraction' configuration option is performance-sensitive. This is because setting the 'maxRefractionDepth' variable based on the value of 'depths.refraction' involves some performance-related operations that can have a notable impact on system performance. The validations performed on the depth value also contribute to the performance sensitivity of this configuration. Additionally, the 'maxRefractionDepth' option directly affects the behavior of the system by determining the maximum depth of refraction rays that can be traced, which can significantly impact the accuracy and realism of rendered images as well as the computational resources required for rendering."
