    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'threads' configuration is considered performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the performance of the rendering process at the system level. By specifying the number of threads to be used for rendering, it can significantly affect the rendering speed by utilizing more CPU cores. This can lead to notable performance variations depending on the scene complexity and rendering settings. Additionally, setting a higher value for 'threads' can increase resource consumption and introduce thread synchronization overhead, further emphasizing its performance sensitivity."
