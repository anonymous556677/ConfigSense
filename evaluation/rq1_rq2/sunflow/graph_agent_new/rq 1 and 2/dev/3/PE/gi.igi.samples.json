    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'gi.igi.samples' configuration is performance-sensitive. This is because changing the number of photons used in InstantGI calculations directly impacts the quality and performance of the global illumination rendering in the system. The configuration involves setting a key parameter that significantly affects the system's rendering process, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Additionally, the configuration-related code context indicates that the 'gi.igi.samples' value is retrieved from the Options object passed to the InstantGI constructor, suggesting that it plays a crucial role in determining the computational workload and memory usage during initialization, making it a performance-sensitive configuration."
