    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'depths.reflection' is considered performance-sensitive. Setting the 'maxReflectionDepth' directly impacts the computational load and memory usage of the system, leading to notable performance variations at the system level. Since reflection operations are time-expensive and memory-expensive, increasing the reflection depth can significantly affect the overall performance of the system. Additionally, the configuration is part of a larger setup method that initializes various parameters based on the options, indicating its importance in the system's performance."
