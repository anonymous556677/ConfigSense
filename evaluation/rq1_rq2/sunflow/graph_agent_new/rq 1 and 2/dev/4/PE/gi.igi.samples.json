    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'gi.igi.samples' configuration option is considered performance-sensitive. This is because it directly impacts the number of photons used for global illumination, which can significantly affect the computational cost and overall system performance. The configuration is retrieved from the 'Options' object passed to the 'InstantGI' constructor, indicating that it is closely tied to performance-related operations within the code. A higher value for 'gi.igi.samples' can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, making it a critical configuration for performance optimization."
