    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'depths.diffuse' is classified as performance-sensitive. This is because setting a higher value for 'depths.diffuse' directly impacts the maximum depth for diffuse rays in the rendering process, which can significantly increase rendering time and memory usage. The code snippet related to this configuration involves initializing the GI engine and calculating photons for caustics, which are time-expensive operations. These operations can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, making the configuration performance-sensitive."
