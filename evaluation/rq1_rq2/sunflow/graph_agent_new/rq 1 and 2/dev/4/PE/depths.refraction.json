    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'depths.refraction' is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the 'depths.refraction' configuration directly impacts the rendering process by setting the maximum refraction depth. This can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, as a higher value can increase rendering time and resource usage significantly. Additionally, the code snippet related to this configuration involves initializing a GI engine and handling caustics photon map engine, which are time-expensive operations contributing to the performance impact."
