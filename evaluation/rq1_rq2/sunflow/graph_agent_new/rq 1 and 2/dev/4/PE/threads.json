    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'threads' configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the system performance at the system level. The number of threads specified in this configuration determines the parallelism level of rendering tasks, which can significantly affect rendering performance. Setting a higher number of threads can lead to notable performance variations by utilizing multiple CPU cores, but it may also increase resource consumption and introduce overhead. Additionally, the 'threads' configuration is triggered whenever the 'render' method is called, which indicates that it is involved in time-expensive operations related to rendering tasks."
