    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'depths.reflection' configuration is performance-sensitive. This is because setting a higher value for 'depths.reflection' can significantly impact the computational load and rendering time of the system. This configuration directly affects the maximum depth of reflection in the rendering process, which is a time-expensive operation. Therefore, any changes to this configuration can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, making it performance-sensitive."
