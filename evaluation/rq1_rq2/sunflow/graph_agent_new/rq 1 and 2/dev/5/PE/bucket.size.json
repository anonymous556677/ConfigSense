    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'bucket.size' is classified as performance-sensitive. This is because the 'bucket.size' directly impacts the number of buckets created during rendering, which affects the distribution of rendering tasks and the overall performance of the rendering process. Since the size of buckets can significantly impact the execution time and memory consumption of the rendering process, any changes in the 'bucket.size' configuration can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Therefore, the 'bucket.size' configuration is considered performance-sensitive."
