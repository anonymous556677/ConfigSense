    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'depths.refraction' configuration is considered performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the rendering quality and performance of the system by setting the maximum depth for refraction calculations. This configuration involves performance-related operations that are time-expensive and memory-expensive within its related code, leading to notable performance variations at the system level. A higher value for 'depths.refraction' may result in more accurate but slower rendering, while a lower value may sacrifice accuracy for speed, indicating a substantial impact on system performance."
