    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'gi.igi.samples' configuration option is classified as performance-sensitive. This is because it directly affects the number of photons used in the InstantGI calculations, which can have a significant impact on the quality and performance of the global illumination in the system. The configuration involves performance-related operations that are time-expensive within its related code, leading to notable performance variations at the system level."
