    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'depths.diffuse' is classified as performance-sensitive. This is because it directly impacts the rendering process by setting the maximum depth for diffuse rays, which can significantly affect the quality and accuracy of rendered images. The validation process to ensure the configuration is not negative and its usage in various calculations indicate that it involves time-expensive operations within its related code. This can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, making it a performance-sensitive configuration."
