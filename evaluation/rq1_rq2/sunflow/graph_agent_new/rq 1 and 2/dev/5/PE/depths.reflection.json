    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'depths.reflection' configuration is performance-sensitive. This is because setting the 'maxReflectionDepth' variable based on this configuration directly impacts the rendering process, which can have a significant effect on computational resources required. Additionally, the validation and initialization operations related to the depth values within the configuration code can also contribute to notable performance variations at the system level."
