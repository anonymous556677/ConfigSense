    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'depths.diffuse' configuration is performance-sensitive. This is because setting a higher value for the maximum diffuse depth can significantly impact the rendering time, as it controls the number of bounces light can take before being absorbed. This directly affects the execution time of the ray tracing calculations at the system level, leading to notable performance variations. Therefore, the configuration is considered performance-sensitive based on its impact on system performance."
