    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'bucket.size' is considered performance-sensitive. This is because the 'bucket.size' directly impacts the rendering process by determining the size of the buckets used for rendering. The size of the buckets affects the number of operations required for rendering, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Additionally, the clamping of the bucket size between 16 and 512 and the computation of the number of buckets based on image dimensions indicate that the configuration involves time-expensive operations within its related code, further supporting its classification as performance-sensitive."
