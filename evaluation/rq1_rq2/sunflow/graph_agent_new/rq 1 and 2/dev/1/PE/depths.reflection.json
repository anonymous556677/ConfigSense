    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'depths.reflection' configuration is performance-sensitive. This is because setting a higher value for 'maxReflectionDepth' directly impacts the computational cost of the rendering process, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Additionally, the configuration code involves setting and validating the 'maxReflectionDepth' variable, which are time-expensive operations contributing to the overall execution time."
