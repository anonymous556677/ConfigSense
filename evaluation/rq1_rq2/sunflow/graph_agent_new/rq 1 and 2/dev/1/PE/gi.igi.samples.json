    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'gi.igi.samples' configuration option is performance-sensitive because it directly affects the quality of Global Illumination in the system, leading to notable performance variations at the system level. Setting a higher value for 'gi.igi.samples' increases computational overhead, making it a time-expensive operation. Additionally, the configuration is triggered each time the 'InstantGI' constructor is called with different values, indicating that it can have a substantial impact on system performance."
