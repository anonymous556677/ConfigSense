    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'depths.diffuse' configuration is performance-sensitive. This is because the value of 'depths.diffuse' directly impacts the maximum depth of diffuse rays considered during rendering, which can significantly affect the computational load and rendering time at the system level. The code snippet related to this configuration also involves calculations and validations that contribute to the overall performance impact of the configuration."
