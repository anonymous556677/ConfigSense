    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'threads' configuration option is classified as performance-sensitive because it directly and substantially affects system performance at the system level. The number of threads specified by this configuration impacts the level of parallelism in rendering tasks, which can significantly affect the overall performance of the system. Additionally, the code snippet related to the 'threads' configuration involves time-expensive operations such as parallel processing of rendering tasks, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
