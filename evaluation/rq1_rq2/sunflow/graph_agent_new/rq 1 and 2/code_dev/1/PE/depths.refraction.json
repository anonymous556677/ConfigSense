    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'depths.refraction' configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly affects the rendering process by determining the maximum depth for refraction rays. This value can significantly impact the computational complexity and rendering time of the system. The code snippet related to this configuration performs validations and initializes components based on the value, indicating its importance in the system's performance. Therefore, any changes to this configuration can lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
