    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'gi.igi.samples' configuration is classified as performance-sensitive. This is because setting the number of photons for Instant Global Illumination directly impacts the quality of the Global Illumination in the system, leading to notable performance variations at the system level. The code snippet provided shows that this configuration is time-expensive as it retrieves the value from the 'Options' object during the instantiation of the 'InstantGI' object, which can contribute significantly to execution time. Additionally, increasing the value for 'gi.igi.samples' can result in more accurate lighting but also increase computational cost and rendering time, indicating a memory-expensive operation."
