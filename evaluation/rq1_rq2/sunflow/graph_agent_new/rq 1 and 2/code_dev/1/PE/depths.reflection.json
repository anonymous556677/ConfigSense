    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'depths.reflection' configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly affects the maximum depth of reflection rays in the rendering process, which can have a significant impact on rendering time and memory usage. The code snippet related to this configuration involves setting the 'maxReflectionDepth' variable based on the provided value, which is a time-expensive operation. Additionally, the validation of depth values and initialization of various parameters related to light sources, GI engines, and caching can also contribute to notable performance variations at the system level. Therefore, the configuration is considered performance-sensitive."
