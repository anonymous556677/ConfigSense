    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The triggering frequency of the 'gi.igi.samples' configuration depends on when an instance of 'InstantGI' is created with the 'Options' object that contains this configuration. It is triggered during the instantiation of the 'InstantGI' object.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the 'gi.igi.samples' configuration option is significant as it directly affects the quality of the Global Illumination in the system. Setting a higher value for 'gi.igi.samples' will result in more accurate and detailed lighting, but it may also increase the computational cost and rendering time."
