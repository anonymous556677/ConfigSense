    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'gi.igi.samples' is performance-sensitive. This is because the number of photons set by this configuration directly impacts the quality of global illumination in the system, which can lead to notable performance variations. Additionally, retrieving and setting the integer value associated with 'gi.igi.samples' in the code context involves performance-related operations that contribute to execution time and memory consumption, making it time-expensive and memory-expensive."
