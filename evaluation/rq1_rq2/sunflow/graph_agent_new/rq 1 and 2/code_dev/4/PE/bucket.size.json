    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'bucket.size' configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly affects the number of buckets used for rendering the scene, which in turn impacts the distribution of work across the rendering process. The bucket size is used in various calculations related to anti-aliasing and filtering, which are time-expensive operations. Additionally, the 'bucket.size' configuration is clamped between 16 and 512, indicating that it has a direct and substantial impact on system performance at the system level by influencing the workload distribution during rendering."
