    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'threads' configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly affects system performance at the system level. The number of threads specified in this configuration determines the parallelism of the rendering process, which can significantly impact the execution time and resource utilization. The code snippet related to the 'threads' configuration shows that it is used to set the number of threads for rendering, which can lead to notable performance variations depending on the number of threads specified. Therefore, the 'threads' configuration is considered performance-sensitive."
