    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The 'depths.refraction' configuration option is not performance-sensitive based on the provided code context. The configuration is simply read from the options and used to set the maximum refraction depth in the system. This operation does not involve any time-expensive or memory-expensive operations that would lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Additionally, the impact of this configuration on system performance is related to the quality and accuracy of rendered images, rather than causing significant performance variations."
