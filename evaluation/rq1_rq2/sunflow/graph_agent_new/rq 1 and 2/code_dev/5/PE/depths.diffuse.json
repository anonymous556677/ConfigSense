    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'depths.diffuse' configuration option is classified as performance-sensitive. This is because setting the maximum diffuse depth directly impacts the quality of light interactions in the scene, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The code snippet related to this configuration involves time-expensive operations such as initializing the GI engine, calculating photons for caustics, and counting total number of light samples, which contribute to significant execution time and memory consumption. Therefore, any changes in the 'depths.diffuse' value can have a substantial impact on system performance."
