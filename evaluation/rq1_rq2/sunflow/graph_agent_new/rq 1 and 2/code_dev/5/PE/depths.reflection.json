    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'depths.reflection' configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly affects the rendering performance of the system at the system level. The 'maxReflectionDepth' variable set by this configuration impacts the quality and accuracy of reflections in the rendered images, which can lead to notable performance variations. The code snippet related to this configuration involves time-expensive operations such as initializing components and performing validations on depth values, which can contribute to significant performance impacts."
