    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'depths.refraction' configuration is classified as performance-sensitive. This is because setting the 'maxRefractionDepth' variable directly impacts the computational cost of tracing refraction rays in the system. The code snippet related to this configuration involves time-expensive operations such as initializing a GI engine and calculating photons for caustics, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Therefore, any changes in the 'depths.refraction' value can have a significant impact on the overall performance of the system."
