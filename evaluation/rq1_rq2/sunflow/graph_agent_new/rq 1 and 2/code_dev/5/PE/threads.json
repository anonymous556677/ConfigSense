    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'threads' configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly affects system performance at the system level by determining the number of threads used for rendering. Setting a higher value for 'threads' can lead to notable performance variations, as it can improve rendering performance by utilizing more CPU cores. The configuration-related code snippet that reads the 'threads' value from the options and sets it for rendering purposes indicates that it involves performance-related operations that are time-expensive and memory-expensive, making it performance-sensitive."
