    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'depths.refraction' configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly affects the rendering process by setting the maximum depth for refraction rays. This value impacts the quality and accuracy of rendered images, as well as the performance of the rendering engine. The code snippet related to this configuration performs validations, calculations, and initializes components based on this value, indicating that it has a significant impact on system performance at the system level."
