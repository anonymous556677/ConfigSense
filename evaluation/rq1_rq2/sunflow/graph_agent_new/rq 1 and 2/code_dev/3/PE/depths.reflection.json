    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'depths.reflection' configuration is classified as performance-sensitive. This is because setting the 'maxReflectionDepth' variable directly impacts the rendering process by affecting the quality of reflections. Higher values for 'maxReflectionDepth' can lead to increased rendering time and memory usage, which are performance-related operations. Additionally, the creation of a CausticPhotonMap based on the 'caustics' option provided also involves performance-related operations. These time-expensive and memory-expensive operations within the configuration code can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, making the configuration performance-sensitive."
