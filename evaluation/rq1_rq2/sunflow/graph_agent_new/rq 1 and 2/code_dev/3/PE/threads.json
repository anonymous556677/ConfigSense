    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'threads' configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly affects system performance at the system level. The number of threads specified by this configuration impacts the rendering performance by utilizing more CPU cores when set to a higher value. This can lead to notable performance variations in terms of execution time and memory consumption. Additionally, the 'threads' configuration involves time-expensive operations within its related code, such as setting the number of threads for rendering, which can significantly impact system performance."
