    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'depths.diffuse' is performance-sensitive because it directly affects the maximum depth for diffuse rays in the rendering process, which can significantly impact the computational cost and rendering quality at the system level. The code snippet related to handling this configuration involves reading and validating the depth value, calculating total light samples, initializing the GI engine, and clearing the shading cache, all of which are time-expensive operations contributing to notable performance variations."
