    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'gi.igi.samples' is performance-sensitive. This is because the 'gi.igi.samples' configuration directly affects the quality of global illumination in the system, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The code snippet shows that the 'gi.igi.samples' value is used to set the number of photons for InstantGI, which can be time-expensive and memory-expensive operations. Additionally, setting a higher value for 'gi.igi.samples' can increase computational overhead, further emphasizing its performance sensitivity."
