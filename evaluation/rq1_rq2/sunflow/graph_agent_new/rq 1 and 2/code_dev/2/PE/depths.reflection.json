    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'depths.reflection' configuration option is classified as performance-sensitive. This is because changing the 'maxReflectionDepth' value directly impacts the rendering process by affecting the quality of reflections in the rendered images. Higher values can increase rendering time and memory usage, while lower values can reduce reflection quality. The code snippet related to this configuration involves validation and initialization of parameters based on the option value, which indicates that it plays a crucial role in the rendering process and can lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
