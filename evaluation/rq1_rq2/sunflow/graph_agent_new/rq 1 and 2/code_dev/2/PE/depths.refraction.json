    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'depths.refraction' configuration option is classified as performance-sensitive. This is because the 'maxRefractionDepth' variable directly impacts the rendering quality of refractive surfaces in the system. Setting a high value for 'maxRefractionDepth' can increase the computational load and memory usage, leading to notable performance variations at the system level. Additionally, the code snippet that initializes the GI engine and handles the caustics photon map engine based on the 'caustics' option are time-expensive operations that contribute to the performance sensitivity of this configuration."
