    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'depths.diffuse' is performance-sensitive. The code snippet related to this configuration involves setting the 'maxDiffuseDepth' variable, which directly impacts the maximum depth allowed for diffuse rays in the rendering process. This value can significantly affect the computational complexity and render time of the system, as it determines the number of bounces of diffuse light. Adjusting this value can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, making it a performance-sensitive configuration."
