    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The 'gi.igi.samples' configuration option is not performance-sensitive. Although it determines the number of photons used in InstantGI calculations, changing this value does not directly and substantially affect system performance at the system level. The code snippet provided shows that it simply retrieves an integer value from the 'options' object during the initialization of InstantGI, which is not time-expensive or memory-expensive. Therefore, the configuration does not lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
