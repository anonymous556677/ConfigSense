    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The configuration 'gi.igi.samples' is used in the code to set the number of photons to be used for Instant Global Illumination. It retrieves the value from the Options object passed to the InstantGI constructor.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The triggering frequency of the 'gi.igi.samples' configuration depends on when an InstantGI object is created with the corresponding Options object. The frequency would vary based on how often InstantGI objects are instantiated in the system.",

A higher value would result in more accurate and detailed lighting, but also increase computational cost."
