    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'bucket.size' configuration option is performance-sensitive. This is because the 'bucket.size' directly affects the number of buckets in each direction, which in turn impacts the anti-aliasing process and the number of rays per sample. The 'bucket.size' configuration involves multiple performance-related operations such as clamping the size, computing bucket order, and adjusting filter settings, all of which contribute to notable performance variations at the system level."
