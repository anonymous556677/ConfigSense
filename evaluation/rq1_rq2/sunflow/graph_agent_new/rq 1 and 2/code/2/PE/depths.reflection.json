    "Reason": "The 'depths.reflection' configuration option is not performance-sensitive. This is because the code related to this configuration does not involve any performance-related operations that are time-expensive or memory-expensive. The code snippet only reads the 'maxReflectionDepth' value from the options and sets it after validation. The operations performed in this code snippet are trivial and do not lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
