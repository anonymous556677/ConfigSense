    "Reason": "The configuration option 'gi.igi.samples' is not performance-sensitive. This is because the code snippet provided shows that the configuration is simply retrieving an integer value from the 'options' object. The operation of getting an integer value from the 'options' object is not time-expensive or memory-expensive, and it does not directly and substantially affect system performance at the system level. Therefore, this configuration is not considered performance-sensitive."
