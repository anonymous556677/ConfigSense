    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'depths.refraction' is not performance-sensitive. This is because the code related to this configuration does not involve any performance-related operations that are time-expensive or memory-expensive. The code snippet only reads the value of 'depths.refraction' from the options and sets it to 'maxRefractionDepth' after validating it. The configuration does not directly and substantially affect system performance at the system level, and it does not lead to notable performance variations. Therefore, it can be classified as not performance-sensitive."
