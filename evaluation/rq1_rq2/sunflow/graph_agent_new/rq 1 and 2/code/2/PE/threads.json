    "Reason": "The 'threads' configuration option is performance-sensitive. This is because the 'threads' configuration directly affects the performance of the system by determining the number of threads used for rendering. The code snippet related to the 'threads' configuration shows that it is used to set the number of threads for rendering, which can have a significant impact on the execution time and memory consumption of the system. Changing the number of threads can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, making it a performance-sensitive configuration."
