    "Reason": "The 'depths.diffuse' configuration option is not performance-sensitive. This is because the code related to this configuration option mainly involves reading and validating integer values from the options, which are standard operations and do not have a significant impact on system performance. The configuration does not involve any time-expensive or memory-expensive operations that would lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
