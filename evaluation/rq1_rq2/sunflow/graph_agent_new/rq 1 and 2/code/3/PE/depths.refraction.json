    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'depths.refraction' is not performance-sensitive. This is because the code related to this configuration does not involve any performance-related operations that are time-expensive or memory-expensive. The configuration setting is simply read from the options and validated without any complex or resource-intensive computations. Therefore, it does not lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
