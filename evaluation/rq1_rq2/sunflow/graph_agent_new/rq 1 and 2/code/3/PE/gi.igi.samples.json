    "Reason": "The configuration option 'gi.igi.samples' is not performance-sensitive. The code snippet provided shows that this configuration is simply initializing a variable 'numPhotons' with a value from the options. There are no performance-related operations or significant performance impacts related to this configuration in the code context. Therefore, it does not lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
