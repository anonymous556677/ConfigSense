    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'threads' configuration option is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the 'threads' configuration directly affects the number of threads used for rendering, which can have a significant impact on performance at the system level. In the provided code context, the 'threads' configuration is used to set the number of threads for rendering, which can be time-expensive and memory-expensive depending on the hardware and workload. Therefore, any changes to the 'threads' configuration can lead to notable performance variations in the system, making it a performance-sensitive configuration."
