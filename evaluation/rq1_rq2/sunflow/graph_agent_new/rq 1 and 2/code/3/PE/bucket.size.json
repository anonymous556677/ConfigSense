    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'bucket.size' configuration option is performance-sensitive. This is because the 'bucket.size' configuration directly affects the computation of the number of buckets in each direction, which in turn impacts the rendering process. The code snippet related to 'bucket.size' involves clamping the size within a certain range and computing the number of buckets based on this size. Any changes in 'bucket.size' will lead to notable performance variations at the system level, affecting the resolution, anti-aliasing, rays per sample, and filter settings. Therefore, the 'bucket.size' configuration is considered performance-sensitive."
