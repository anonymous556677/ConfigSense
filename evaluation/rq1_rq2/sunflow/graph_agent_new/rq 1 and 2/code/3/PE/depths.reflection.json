    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'depths.reflection' is performance-sensitive. This is because the 'maxReflectionDepth' parameter directly affects the performance of the system by controlling the maximum depth of reflection rays in the rendering process. The code snippet related to 'maxReflectionDepth' involves time-expensive operations such as initializing the GI engine, calculating photons for caustics, and clearing the shading cache. These operations contribute significantly to the execution time and memory consumption of the system, leading to notable performance variations at the system level."
