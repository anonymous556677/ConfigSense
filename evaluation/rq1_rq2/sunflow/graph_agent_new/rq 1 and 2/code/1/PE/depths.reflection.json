    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The 'depths.reflection' configuration option is not performance-sensitive. This is because the code related to this configuration option does not contain any performance-related operations that are time-expensive or memory-expensive. The code snippet provided mainly focuses on reading and validating options, initializing variables, and printing information. There are no operations that directly and substantially affect system performance at the system level. Therefore, the 'depths.reflection' configuration can be classified as not performance-sensitive."
