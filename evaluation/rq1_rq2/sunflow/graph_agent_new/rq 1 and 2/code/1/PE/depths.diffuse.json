    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'depths.diffuse' is not performance-sensitive. The code snippet related to this configuration does not contain any performance-intensive operations that would lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The configuration is simply reading an integer value from the options and performing basic validation on it, which does not have a significant impact on system performance."
