    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'gi.igi.samples' is not performance-sensitive. This is because the code snippet related to this configuration only involves simple assignment of integer values from the options, which does not involve any time-expensive or memory-expensive operations. Additionally, the configuration does not directly and substantially affect system performance at the system level, and it does not lead to notable performance variations."
