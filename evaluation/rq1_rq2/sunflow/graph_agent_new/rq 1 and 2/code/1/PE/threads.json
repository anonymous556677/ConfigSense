    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'threads' configuration option is performance-sensitive. This is because the 'threads' configuration directly affects the performance of the system at the system level. The 'threads' configuration is used to set the number of threads for rendering and other operations, which can significantly impact the execution time and memory consumption of the system. Additionally, the code snippet related to the 'threads' configuration involves time-expensive operations such as setting the number of threads for rendering and image resolution calculations, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
