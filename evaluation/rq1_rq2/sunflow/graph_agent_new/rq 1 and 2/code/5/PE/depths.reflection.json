    "Reason": "The 'depths.reflection' configuration option is not performance-sensitive. This is because the code related to this configuration option does not contain any performance-related operations that are time-expensive or memory-expensive. The code snippet provided mainly involves reading and setting configuration values, initializing variables, and printing information. These operations are not significant enough to cause notable performance variations at the system level."
