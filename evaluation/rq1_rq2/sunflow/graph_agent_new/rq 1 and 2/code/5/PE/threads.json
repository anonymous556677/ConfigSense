    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'threads' configuration option is performance-sensitive. This is because the 'threads' configuration directly affects the execution time and memory consumption of the program. In the provided code context, the 'threads' configuration is used to set the number of threads for rendering, which can significantly impact the performance of the rendering process. Setting the number of threads too high or too low can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, making this configuration performance-sensitive."
