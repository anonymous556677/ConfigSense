    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'gi.igi.samples' is not performance-sensitive. The code snippet provided shows that this configuration is simply used to set the number of photons, which does not involve any time-expensive or memory-expensive operations. Additionally, the configuration does not directly and substantially affect system performance at the system level, and it does not lead to notable performance variations. Therefore, it is classified as not performance-sensitive."
