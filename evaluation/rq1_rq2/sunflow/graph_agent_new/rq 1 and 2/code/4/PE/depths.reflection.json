    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'depths.reflection' is performance-sensitive. This is because the 'maxReflectionDepth' configuration directly affects the performance of the system by controlling the maximum depth of reflection rays in the rendering process. The code snippet related to this configuration involves operations that are time-expensive, such as initializing the GI engine and calculating photons for caustics. These operations contribute significantly to the execution time and memory consumption of the system, leading to notable performance variations at the system level."
