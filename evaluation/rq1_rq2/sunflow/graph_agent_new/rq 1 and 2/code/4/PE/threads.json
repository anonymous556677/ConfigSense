    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'threads' configuration option is performance-sensitive. This is because the 'threads' configuration directly affects the number of threads used for rendering, which can have a significant impact on performance at the system level. The code snippet related to the 'threads' configuration shows that it is used to set the number of threads for rendering, which can be a time-expensive operation depending on the hardware and workload. Additionally, the 'threads' configuration is crucial for optimizing rendering performance, as it determines how efficiently the rendering process can utilize available resources. Therefore, any changes to the 'threads' configuration can lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
