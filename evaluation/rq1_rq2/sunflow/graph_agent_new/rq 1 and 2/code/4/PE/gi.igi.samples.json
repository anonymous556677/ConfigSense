    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'gi.igi.samples' is not performance-sensitive. This is because the code snippet provided shows that this configuration is simply used to set the number of photons, which is a basic setting and does not involve any time-expensive or memory-expensive operations. Additionally, setting the number of photons is unlikely to directly and substantially affect system performance at the system level. Therefore, this configuration can be considered trivial in terms of performance impact."
