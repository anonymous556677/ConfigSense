    "Reason": "The configuration option 'depths.refraction' is not performance-sensitive. This is because the code snippet related to this configuration does not contain any performance-related operations that are time-expensive or memory-expensive. The configuration simply reads an integer value from the options and assigns it to 'maxRefractionDepth' variable. This operation is straightforward and does not lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
