    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The triggering frequency of the 'gi.igi.samples' configuration depends on how often the InstantGI class is instantiated and initialized with the Options object. If InstantGI is frequently used in the system, the configuration will be triggered more often.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the 'gi.igi.samples' configuration option is significant as it directly affects the quality of global illumination in the system. Setting a higher value for 'gi.igi.samples' can improve the accuracy of the global illumination simulation but may also increase computational overhead."
