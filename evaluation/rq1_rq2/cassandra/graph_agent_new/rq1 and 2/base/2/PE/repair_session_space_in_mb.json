    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'repair_session_space_in_mb' configuration is performance-sensitive. The configuration directly impacts the memory usage during repair operations by limiting the space for holding RF trees in memory. The code context shows that the configuration is used to calculate the available space for Merkle tree calculations, which are time-expensive and memory-expensive operations. Setting this configuration too low can result in heap pressure during repairs, while setting it too high can lead to over-streaming data, directly affecting system performance at the system level."
