    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'windows_timer_interval' is performance-sensitive. This is because it directly impacts the system timer on Windows, affecting timer intervals, thread scheduling, driver interrupts, etc. Changing this configuration from the default 15ms to 1ms can have a significant impact on system performance, leading to notable performance variations at the system level. The code snippets related to this configuration involve time-expensive operations like adjusting the system timer, which can have a substantial effect on system performance. Therefore, based on the code context and developer's information, the 'windows_timer_interval' configuration is classified as performance-sensitive."
