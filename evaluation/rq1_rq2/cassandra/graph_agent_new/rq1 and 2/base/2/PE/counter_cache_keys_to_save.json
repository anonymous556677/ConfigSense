    "classification_result": "Performance-insensitive with 100% confidence",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'Number of keys from the counter cache to save' is related to saving keys in the counter cache, which is not directly related to performance-sensitive operations. It is simply a setting to determine how many keys are saved, and does not impact system performance in a significant way."
