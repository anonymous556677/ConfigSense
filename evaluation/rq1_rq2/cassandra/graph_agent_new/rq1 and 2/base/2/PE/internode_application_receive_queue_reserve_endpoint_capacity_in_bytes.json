    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'internode_application_receive_queue_reserve_endpoint_capacity_in_bytes' is performance-sensitive. This is because it directly impacts system performance at the system level by setting limits on the memory consumption related to queued messages for delivery and processing between nodes in the cluster. The configuration ensures that memory usage is controlled and prevents overwhelming of nodes with queued messages, which can lead to performance degradation and instability. The code context reveals that the configuration is crucial for managing memory utilization and maintaining system stability, making it performance-sensitive."
