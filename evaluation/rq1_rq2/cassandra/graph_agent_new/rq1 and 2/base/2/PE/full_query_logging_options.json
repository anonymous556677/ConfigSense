    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'full_query_logging_options' is classified as performance-sensitive. This classification is based on the fact that the configuration directly impacts the behavior and performance of the full query logger functionality within the system. The code context reveals that customizing the full query logger options, such as log directory, roll cycle, blocking behavior, queue weight, log size, archive command, and archive retries, can significantly affect storage usage, system performance, and overall system behavior. The configuration-related code contains operations that are time-expensive and memory-expensive, such as retrieving and setting various options based on user input or default values. These operations can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, making the 'full_query_logging_options' configuration performance-sensitive."
