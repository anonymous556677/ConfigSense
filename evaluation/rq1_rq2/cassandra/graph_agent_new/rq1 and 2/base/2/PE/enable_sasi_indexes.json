    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'enable_sasi_indexes' configuration option is classified as performance-sensitive. This classification is based on the fact that enabling SASI indexes through this configuration can impact system performance and resource utilization significantly. The configuration check directly affects the creation and update of indexes in the Cassandra schema, which are operations that can be time-expensive and memory-expensive. Enabling SASI indexes is experimental and not recommended for production, indicating that it can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Therefore, the configuration is considered performance-sensitive as it directly and substantially affects system performance."
