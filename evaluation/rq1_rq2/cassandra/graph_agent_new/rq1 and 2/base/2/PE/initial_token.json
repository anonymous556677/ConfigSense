    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The 'initial_token' configuration option is not performance-sensitive based on the provided code context and developer's information. The configuration mainly deals with manual token assignment for nodes in the cluster, which may impact data distribution but does not involve any time-expensive or memory-expensive operations that would lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The code primarily focuses on handling different scenarios for token assignment based on user input or system settings, without directly impacting system performance in a significant way."
