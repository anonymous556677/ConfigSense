    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The 'auto_snapshot' configuration option is not performance-sensitive. The code related to this configuration does not contain any performance-related operations that significantly impact system performance at the system level. The configuration mainly deals with taking a snapshot for data safety during keyspace truncation or dropping of column families, which does not have a notable performance impact. The 'auto_snapshot' configuration is more focused on data integrity and availability rather than performance optimization."
