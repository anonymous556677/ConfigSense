    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'sstable_preemptive_open_interval_in_mb' is performance-sensitive. This is because the value of this configuration directly impacts the open interval for preemptive opening of SSTables, which in turn affects the performance of compacting operations in the system. The method calculateOpenInterval() performs a time-expensive operation by multiplying the value of 'sstable_preemptive_open_interval_in_mb' by 1MB, and based on certain conditions, it can lead to notable performance variations at the system level by setting the interval to Long.MAX_VALUE. Therefore, the configuration involves performance-related operations that are time-extensive and directly affect system performance, making it performance-sensitive."
