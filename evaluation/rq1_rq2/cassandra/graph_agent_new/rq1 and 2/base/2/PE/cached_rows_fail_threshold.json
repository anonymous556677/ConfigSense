    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'cached_rows_fail_threshold' is performance-sensitive. The configuration directly affects the system performance by setting a threshold for the number of failed cached replica rows that can trigger specific actions. This threshold value impacts the behavior of the system in handling inconsistent replica filtering, which involves time-extensive operations like short-read protection, merge listeners, and lazy completion of potentially out-of-date rows. The configuration is used in the ReplicaFilteringProtection class, which plays a crucial role in ensuring data consistency and accuracy in the system. Therefore, the 'cached_rows_fail_threshold' configuration is performance-sensitive as it involves performance-related operations that lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
