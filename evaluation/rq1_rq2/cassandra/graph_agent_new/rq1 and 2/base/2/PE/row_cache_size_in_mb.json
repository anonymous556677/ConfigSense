    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'row_cache_size_in_mb' configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the memory usage of the system at the system level. The code snippets provided show that the configuration value is used to set the capacity of the row cache, affecting memory consumption. Setting a larger value for this configuration can lead to higher memory usage, potentially causing memory-related issues and impacting system performance. Therefore, the configuration is considered performance-sensitive based on its significant impact on system-level performance."
