    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'snapshot_links_per_second' is performance-sensitive. The code context shows that the value of 'snapshot_links_per_second' is used to create a RateLimiter object, which can have a significant impact on the system's performance. Additionally, the developer's explanation indicates that this configuration is crucial for throttling the creation or clearing of snapshot links to prevent negative performance impact on consumer grade SSDs. This directly affects system performance at the system level, making it performance-sensitive."
