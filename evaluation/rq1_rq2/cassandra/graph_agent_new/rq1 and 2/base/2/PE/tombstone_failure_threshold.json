    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The 'tombstone_failure_threshold' configuration is not performance-sensitive because it is only used to retrieve a threshold value from the DatabaseDescriptor. The code context does not involve any performance-related operations that significantly impact system performance. The configuration is simply used to fetch a value and does not lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
