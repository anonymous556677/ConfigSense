{
    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'internode_tcp_user_timeout_in_ms' is classified as performance-sensitive. This is because the 'tcpUserTimeoutInMS' method directly impacts the timeout value for establishing internode TCP connections in Cassandra, which is a critical operation for system performance. The method involves retrieving timeout values from 'DatabaseDescriptor.getInternodeTcpUserTimeoutInMS()' and 'DatabaseDescriptor.getInternodeStreamingTcpUserTimeoutInMS()', which are time-expensive operations. The timeout value set by this configuration can significantly affect the performance of the system at the system level, making it performance-sensitive."
