    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'streaming_connections_per_host' configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the number of streaming connections allowed per host, which can significantly affect the system's performance at the system level. The configuration is used in the code to limit the number of connections per host for streaming operations like bootstrap and rebuild. By adjusting this configuration, the system can optimize data transfer and processing speed, leading to notable performance variations. The code context shows that the configuration value is retrieved and used in critical operations that contribute to execution time and memory consumption, making it performance-sensitive."
