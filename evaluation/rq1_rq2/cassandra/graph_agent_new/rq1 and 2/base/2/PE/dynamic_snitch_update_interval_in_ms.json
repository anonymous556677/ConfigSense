    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'dynamic_snitch_update_interval_in_ms' is performance-sensitive. This is because it directly affects the frequency at which the more expensive part of host score calculation is performed in the code. By changing the update interval for the dynamic endpoint snitch, it can have a notable impact on the performance and responsiveness of the system. The configuration-related code clearly shows how this configuration is used to schedule tasks at specific intervals, which can lead to significant performance variations at the system level."
