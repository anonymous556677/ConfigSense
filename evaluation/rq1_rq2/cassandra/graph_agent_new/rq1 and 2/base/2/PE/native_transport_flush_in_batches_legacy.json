    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'native_transport_flush_in_batches_legacy' is classified as performance-sensitive. The code context shows that this configuration is directly related to the method DatabaseDescriptor.useNativeTransportLegacyFlusher(), which is used to determine whether to enable TCP message coalescing. This operation can have a notable impact on system performance by improving network throughput, especially for systems with old kernels or few client connections. Enabling this configuration can lead to significant performance variations at the system level, making it performance-sensitive."
