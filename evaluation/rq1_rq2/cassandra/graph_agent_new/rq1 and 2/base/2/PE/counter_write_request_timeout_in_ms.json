    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'counter_write_request_timeout_in_ms' is classified as performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly affects the timeout duration for counter write operations, which are critical for system performance. The code context provided shows that the configuration is used in various methods to fetch the configured timeout value in different time units. The 'counter_write_request_timeout_in_ms' configuration involves performance-related operations that are time-expensive and directly impact the system's performance at the system level by determining the maximum time allowed for counter write operations to complete. Any notable variations in this configuration can lead to significant performance impacts on the system."
