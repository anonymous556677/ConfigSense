    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'streaming_keep_alive_period_in_secs' is performance-sensitive. This is because the value of this configuration directly impacts the frequency of keep-alive messages sent between nodes during streaming sessions. A shorter period results in more frequent messages but quicker detection of stalled streams, while a longer period reduces network overhead but increases the risk of session timeouts. The code context provided shows that this configuration is used to schedule keep-alive tasks for channels, which are time-expensive operations that directly affect system performance at the system level by managing the communication and health of streaming sessions."
