    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'ideal_consistency_level' is performance-sensitive because it directly affects the system performance by adding additional logic to track the ideal consistency level for replication. The code context shows that this configuration involves setting up response handlers based on the ideal consistency level, which can impact the execution time and memory consumption during write operations. The configuration directly influences the behavior of the system at the system level by tracking the ideal consistency level, making it performance-sensitive."
