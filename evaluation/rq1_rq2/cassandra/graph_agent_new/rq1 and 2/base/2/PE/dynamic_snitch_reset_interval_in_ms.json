    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'dynamic_snitch_reset_interval_in_ms' is performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly impacts the performance and behavior of the system by controlling how often host scores are reset. The code snippet provided shows that the configuration is used to schedule tasks for updating and resetting host scores based on the configured interval. This operation is time-expensive and memory-expensive as it involves scheduling tasks that can significantly affect system performance at the system level by allowing bad hosts to recover and potentially improve their scores over time."
