    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'internode_application_send_queue_reserve_endpoint_capacity_in_bytes' is performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly impacts the per-endpoint limit on messages queued for delivery to other nodes and affects the global and per-connection limits on message queue sizes. The code context shows that the configuration sets the capacity limits based on retrieved values and then updates the OutboundConnectionSettings with the new limits. This operation involves time-expensive and memory-expensive operations that can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, making it performance-sensitive."
