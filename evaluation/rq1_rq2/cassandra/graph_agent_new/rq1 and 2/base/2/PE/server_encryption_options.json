    "Reason": "The 'server_encryption_options' configuration option is not performance-sensitive. Although it involves setting up SSL contexts, creating SSL connections, and validating SSL certificates, the operations performed by this configuration do not directly and substantially affect system performance at the system level. The configuration is more focused on ensuring secure communication between servers rather than causing notable performance variations."
