    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'report_unconfirmed_repaired_data_mismatches' is performance-sensitive. The code context shows that when this configuration is set to true, additional metrics for unconfirmed data mismatches are recorded, which can increase the amount of data stored and potentially impact system performance. The 'verify' method, where this configuration is checked, is called multiple times in the system, and the additional processing required for handling unconfirmed mismatches can lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
