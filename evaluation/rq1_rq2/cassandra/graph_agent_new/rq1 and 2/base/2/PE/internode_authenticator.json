    "Reason": "The 'internode_authenticator' configuration option is not performance-sensitive. The code related to this configuration mainly focuses on setting the internode authenticator for establishing connections with peer nodes. While the configuration is crucial for security and integrity of internode communication, it does not involve any performance-intensive operations that would lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The code snippet provided primarily deals with setting and validating the authenticator, authorizer, role manager, and network authorizer, which are essential for system functionality but do not directly impact performance in a significant way."
