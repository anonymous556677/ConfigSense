    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'file_cache_size_in_mb' configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the memory allocation for the sstable chunk cache and buffer pooling in the system. The calculation of the cache size based on DatabaseDescriptor.getFileCacheSizeInMB() and the subsequent creation of the ChunkCache instance are critical for system performance. The configuration involves time-expensive and memory-expensive operations that significantly affect system performance at the system level by determining the amount of memory allocated for caching data. Therefore, any changes to this configuration can lead to notable performance variations."
