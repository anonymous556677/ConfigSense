{
    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'cdc_free_space_check_interval_ms' is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the interval specified by this configuration directly impacts the frequency of checks for available space in cdc_raw. This interval affects the system's resource consumption and the risk of hitting the cdc_raw limit without timely intervention. The configuration involves performance-related operations such as scheduling periodic checks, which can be time-expensive and memory-expensive, leading to notable performance variations at the system level."
