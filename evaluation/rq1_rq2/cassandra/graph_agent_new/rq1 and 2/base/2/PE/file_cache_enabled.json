    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'file_cache_enabled' configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly affects the system's memory usage and performance at the system level. The configuration determines whether the sstable chunk cache should be enabled, which stores recently accessed sections of the sstable in-memory to improve read performance by reducing disk I/O. Enabling the chunk cache consumes memory to store uncompressed buffers, impacting memory usage and potentially improving performance. The configuration involves performance-related operations such as checking if the file cache is enabled and if the cache size is greater than 0, which directly influences the instantiation of the ChunkCache instance and leads to notable performance variations at the system level."
