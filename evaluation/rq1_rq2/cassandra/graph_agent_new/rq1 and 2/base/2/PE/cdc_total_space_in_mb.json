{
    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'cdc_total_space_in_mb' is classified as performance-sensitive. The code context provided shows that this configuration involves a performance-related operation by multiplying the value obtained from DatabaseDescriptor.getCDCSpaceInMB() by 1024 * 1024, which can be time-expensive and memory-expensive. Additionally, the developer's explanation highlights the significant impact of this configuration on system performance, as exceeding the threshold set by 'cdc_total_space_in_mb' can lead to disruptions in data processing and potential WriteTimeoutExceptions on Mutations, affecting the system's performance at the system level."
