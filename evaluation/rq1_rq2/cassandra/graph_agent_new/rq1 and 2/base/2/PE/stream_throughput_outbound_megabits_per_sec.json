    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'stream_throughput_outbound_megabits_per_sec' is performance-sensitive. The method 'calculateRateInBytes' directly calculates the rate in bytes based on the configured throughput, which involves performance-related operations that contribute to execution time. Setting a higher or lower value for this configuration can significantly impact the throttling of streaming file transfers between datacenters, leading to notable performance variations at the system level. Therefore, this configuration is considered performance-sensitive."
