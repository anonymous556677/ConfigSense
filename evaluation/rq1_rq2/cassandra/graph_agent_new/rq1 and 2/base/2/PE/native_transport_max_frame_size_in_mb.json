    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'native_transport_max_frame_size_in_mb' is performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly impacts the maximum size of allowed frames in the system, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Changing this configuration can affect memory usage and processing time, making it a critical parameter for system performance."
