    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'dynamic_snitch_badness_threshold' is performance-sensitive because it directly influences the badness threshold for dynamically adjusting replica selection in the system. This configuration impacts the performance by determining when to prefer other replicas over a pinned host based on its badness score, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The code context shows that the configuration is used to control the update and reset scheduler tasks, which are time-expensive operations affecting system performance."
