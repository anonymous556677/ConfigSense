    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'row_cache_save_period' is performance-sensitive. The code context provided shows that the 'rowCache.scheduleSaving(DatabaseDescriptor.getRowCacheSavePeriod(), rowCacheKeysToSave);' method call is directly related to the configuration setting 'row_cache_save_period'. This method schedules the saving of the row cache at a specified interval based on the value of 'row_cache_save_period'. The frequency of saving the row cache can have a significant impact on system performance, especially if the saving process is too frequent and resource-intensive. Therefore, the configuration directly and substantially affects system performance at the system level, making it performance-sensitive."
