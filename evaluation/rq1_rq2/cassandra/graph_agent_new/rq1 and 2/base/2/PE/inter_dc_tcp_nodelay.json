    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'inter_dc_tcp_nodelay' is performance-sensitive. The code context shows that the configuration directly impacts the decision to enable or disable tcp_nodelay for inter-dc communication. Enabling or disabling tcp_nodelay can significantly affect network packet sizes and latency, which can have notable performance implications at the system level. Additionally, the triggering frequency of this configuration depends on the frequency of inter-dc communication requests, indicating its potential impact on system performance."
