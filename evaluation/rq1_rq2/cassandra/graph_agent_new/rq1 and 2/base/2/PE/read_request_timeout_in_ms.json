{
    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'read_request_timeout_in_ms' is classified as performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is based on the following factors:\n1. System Level Perspective: The configuration directly impacts the performance of read operations in the system by setting the timeout for read operations. A lower value can lead to premature timeouts, affecting system responsiveness, while a higher value can increase latency.\n2. Configuration-Related Code Perspective: The configuration is used in multiple methods to set the timeout for read operations. It is crucial for determining how long the coordinator should wait for read operations to complete, indicating its significance in influencing system performance."
