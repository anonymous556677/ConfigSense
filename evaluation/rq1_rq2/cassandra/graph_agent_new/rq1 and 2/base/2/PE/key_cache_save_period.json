    "classification_result": "Performance-insensitive with 100% confidence",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'Duration in seconds after which Cassandra should save the key cache' is related to saving key caches to improve cold-start speeds. It is relatively cheap in terms of I/O for the key cache and does not involve performance-related operations or affect system performance. It is unrelated to any time-dependent aspects of system operation."
