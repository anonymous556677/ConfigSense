    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'tracetype_query_ttl' is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the configuration directly impacts the TTL values for different trace types during the logging of the repair process. The TTL values are stored in an array and accessed based on the ordinal value of the TraceType enum. This operation involves memory-expensive operations as it manages the storage and retrieval of trace session data, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
