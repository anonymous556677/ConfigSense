    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'compaction_throughput_mb_per_sec' is performance-sensitive. The code context shows that this configuration directly influences the rate limiter for compaction, which in turn affects the speed of compaction operations in the system. By setting the throughput limit, the configuration controls the performance impact of compaction on system resources, making it a critical factor in managing system performance. Additionally, the developer's explanation highlights the significant impact of this configuration on optimizing system performance by controlling the speed of compaction relative to data insertion rates. Therefore, the configuration is considered performance-sensitive due to its direct and substantial effect on system performance at the system level."
