    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'enable_user_defined_functions' is performance-sensitive. This is because the setting directly impacts the system performance by enabling or disabling user-defined functions, which can have a significant impact on execution time and memory consumption. The code context shows that if the configuration is not set to true, an InvalidRequestException is thrown, indicating that user-defined functions are disabled. Enabling user-defined functions can introduce additional processing overhead and memory usage, making it a performance-sensitive configuration."
