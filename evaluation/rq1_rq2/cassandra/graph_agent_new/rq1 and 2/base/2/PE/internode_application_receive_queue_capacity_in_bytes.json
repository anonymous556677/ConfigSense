    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'internode_application_receive_queue_capacity_in_bytes' is performance-sensitive. This is because the capacity of the application receive queue directly impacts the memory consumption and message processing efficiency of internode communication at the system level. The code context shows that this configuration is crucial for limiting the size of messages that can be queued for delivery to the local node. If this capacity is set too low, it can lead to dropped messages or increased latency due to message backlogs, which can have a notable performance impact on the system."
