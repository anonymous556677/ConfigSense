    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'internode_tcp_connect_timeout_in_ms' is classified as performance-sensitive. This is because the timeout value set by this configuration directly impacts the time taken to establish internode tcp connections in the Cassandra cluster. The method tcpConnectTimeoutInMS() retrieves this configuration value, and if it is not null, returns it directly. This timeout value plays a crucial role in the performance and reliability of internode communication, making it a critical factor at the system level. Any significant changes to this configuration can lead to notable performance variations, affecting the responsiveness and stability of the system."
