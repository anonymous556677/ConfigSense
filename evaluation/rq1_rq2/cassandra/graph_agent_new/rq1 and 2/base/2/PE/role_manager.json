    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'role_manager' is not performance-sensitive. The code primarily focuses on authentication and authorization logic, role management, and permission checks. While these operations are crucial for security and access control, they do not involve performance-intensive operations that would significantly impact system performance at the system level. The code does not contain any performance-related operations that are time-expensive or memory-expensive, leading to notable performance variations."
