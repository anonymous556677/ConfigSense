    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'network_authorizer' configuration is classified as performance-sensitive. This classification is based on the fact that the configuration directly impacts system performance by managing permissions related to network access. The configuration involves operations that check user access to data centers, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Additionally, the configuration code contains methods like 'hasLocalAccess()' that perform operations on behalf of the network authorizer, which are time-expensive and memory-expensive, contributing to the overall performance sensitivity of the configuration."
