    "classification_result": "Performance-insensitive with 100% confidence",
    "Reason": "The internode_compression configuration option is performance-insensitive because it only controls whether traffic between nodes is compressed. This setting does not involve any performance-related operations or affect system performance, and it is unrelated to any time-dependent aspects of system operation."
