    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'allocate_tokens_for_keyspace' configuration is classified as performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly impacts the token allocation process, which in turn affects the distribution of data across the cluster and the overall performance of the system. The code context shows that depending on the specified initial tokens or allocationKeyspace, different token allocation strategies are employed, which can have a notable impact on system performance at the system level."
