    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'num_tokens' configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the data distribution and storage load balancing across the cluster. The number of tokens assigned to a node affects the proportion of data it stores, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The code context shows that the configuration is used to determine the tokens for bootstrap, which is a critical operation impacting the overall performance of the system. Therefore, any changes in the 'num_tokens' configuration can have a substantial performance impact, making it performance-sensitive."
