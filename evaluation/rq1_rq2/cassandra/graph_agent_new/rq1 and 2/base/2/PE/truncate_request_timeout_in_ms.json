{
    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'truncate_request_timeout_in_ms' is classified as performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly affects the timeout duration for truncate operations, which are critical operations in the system. The code snippets related to the configuration involve time-expensive operations such as calculating timeout durations and handling timeout exceptions. Any changes to this configuration can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, impacting the overall system performance. Therefore, the configuration is considered performance-sensitive."
