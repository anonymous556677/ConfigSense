    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'enable_materialized_views' configuration is performance-sensitive. This is because enabling materialized views involves multiple performance-related operations within the code context provided. The configuration directly impacts system performance by introducing additional processing and storage requirements for maintaining materialized views. This can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, making it a performance-sensitive configuration."
