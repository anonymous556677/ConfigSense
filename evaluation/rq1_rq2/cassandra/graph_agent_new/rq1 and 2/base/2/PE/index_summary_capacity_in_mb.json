    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'index_summary_capacity_in_mb' configuration option is performance-sensitive. This is because the memory pool size set by this configuration directly impacts the memory consumption of the system at the system level. The code snippet provided initializes the memory pool size based on this configuration, and any changes to this configuration can lead to notable performance variations in terms of memory usage. Additionally, the developer's explanation highlights the significance of this configuration in determining the memory pool size for SSTable index summaries, further emphasizing its performance sensitivity."
