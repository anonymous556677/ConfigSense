    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'repaired_data_tracking_for_range_reads_enabled' is performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly impacts the system performance by adding overhead to range read operations when enabled. The code snippet shows that the configuration is checked before tracking the repaired status of data during reads and comparison between replicas. Enabling this configuration option may lead to notable performance variations at the system level, especially when there are multiple full replicas to compare results from. The configuration involves performance-related operations that are time-expensive, as it adds additional processing for tracking repaired data during range reads. Therefore, it is classified as performance-sensitive based on its direct and substantial impact on system performance."
