    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'slow_query_log_timeout_in_ms' configuration is classified as performance-sensitive. This classification is based on the fact that the configuration directly affects system performance at the system level by determining when slow queries are logged. The code snippet related to the configuration involves time-expensive operations such as calculating timeouts for queries and monitoring query execution times. These operations contribute significantly to the overall execution time and memory consumption of the system, leading to notable performance variations. Therefore, the configuration is considered performance-sensitive."
