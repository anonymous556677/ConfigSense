    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'enable_drop_compact_storage' is performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly impacts the ability to use the 'ALTER ... DROP COMPACT STORAGE' statement, which can lead to changes in storage efficiency and performance at the system level. The code related to this configuration includes validation checks and exception handling, indicating that it involves time-expensive operations that can significantly affect system performance. Additionally, the triggering frequency of this configuration depends on when the 'ALTER ... DROP COMPACT STORAGE' statement is executed, further emphasizing its performance sensitivity."
