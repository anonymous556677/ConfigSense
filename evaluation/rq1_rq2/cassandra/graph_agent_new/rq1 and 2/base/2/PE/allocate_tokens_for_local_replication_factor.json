    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'allocate_tokens_for_local_replication_factor' configuration is classified as performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly impacts the token allocation process for new nodes joining the cluster, which is a critical operation for data distribution and replication within the system. The code context shows that the configuration involves time-expensive operations such as generating suitable tokens based on specified replication factors or keyspace allocations. These operations can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, making the configuration performance-sensitive."
