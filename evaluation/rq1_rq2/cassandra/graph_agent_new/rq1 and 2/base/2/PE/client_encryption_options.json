    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'client_encryption_options' configuration is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the configuration involves creating SSL contexts, managing SSL connections, and validating SSL certificates, which are time-expensive and memory-expensive operations. These operations directly impact system performance at the system level by consuming resources and adding overhead to secure client-to-server communication."
