    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'cached_rows_warn_threshold' is performance-sensitive. This is because the 'cached_rows_warn_threshold' configuration directly influences the number of rows materialized on-heap during query processing, affecting system performance at the system level. The code snippet shows that this configuration is used to set a threshold for warning logging based on the number of rows from replicas. Exceeding this threshold can lead to warnings being logged, indicating potential issues in query processing. As this configuration impacts the amount of data processed and logged during queries, it can cause notable performance variations at the system level."
