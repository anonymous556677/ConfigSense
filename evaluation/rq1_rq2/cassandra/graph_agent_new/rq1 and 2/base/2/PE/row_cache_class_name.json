    "classification_result": "Performance-insensitive with 100% confidence",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'Row cache implementation class name' is related to the type of row cache implementation used in Cassandra. This configuration does not involve any performance-related operations or time-dependent aspects of system operation. It simply specifies the implementation class name for the row cache, which does not impact system performance."
