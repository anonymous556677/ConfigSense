    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'tombstone_warn_threshold' configuration is performance-sensitive. The configuration directly affects the performance and memory usage of the system by setting the threshold for warning about tombstones during scans. Adjusting this threshold impacts the amount of tombstones kept in memory, which can significantly affect system performance and memory consumption at the system level. The code context shows that this configuration is used to retrieve the tombstone warning threshold from the DatabaseDescriptor class, which is crucial for handling tombstones efficiently during read operations."
