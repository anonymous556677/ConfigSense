    "classification_result": "Performance-insensitive with 100% confidence",
    "Reason": "The partitioner configuration option is related to distributing rows across nodes in the cluster based on partition key. Changing the partitioner does not directly impact system performance, but rather affects data distribution and compatibility. It does not involve performance-related operations or affect system performance, making it performance-insensitive."
