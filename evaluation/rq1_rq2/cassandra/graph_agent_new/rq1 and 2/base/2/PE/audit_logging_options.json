    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'audit_logging_options' configuration is performance-sensitive. The configuration directly impacts system performance by enabling or disabling audit logging, which can significantly affect the execution time and memory consumption. The code snippets related to initializing the AuditLogManager, enabling audit logging, and creating the BinAuditLogger involve performance-related operations that contribute to notable performance variations at the system level. Enabling audit logging with specific parameters can increase the size of audit logs stored on disk and potentially impact overall system performance. Therefore, the configuration is classified as performance-sensitive."
