    "classification_result": "Performance-insensitive with 100% confidence",
    "Reason": "The configuration option of creating hard links to each sstable flushed or streamed locally in a backups/ subdirectory of the keyspace data is not performance-sensitive as it does not involve any performance-related operations or affect system performance. It is simply a mechanism for data backup and does not impact the overall system performance."
