    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'index_summary_resize_interval_in_minutes' is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the configuration directly impacts the system performance by determining how frequently index summaries are resampled, leading to memory redistribution based on recent read rates. Setting a lower interval may result in more frequent resampling and memory redistribution, potentially affecting system performance. Additionally, the code context shows that the configuration is used to set the resize interval for the IndexSummaryManager, which directly affects memory pool size and resize interval, both of which are time-expensive operations that can lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
