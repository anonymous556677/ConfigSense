    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'internode_socket_send_buffer_size_in_bytes' is classified as performance-sensitive. This is because the size of the socket buffer set by this configuration directly impacts the performance of internode communication at the system level. The code context shows that the method 'socketSendBufferSizeInBytes' retrieves this configuration value, indicating that it is a critical parameter for communication efficiency. Additionally, the developer's information highlights the importance of considering network buffer settings and memory usage impact, further emphasizing the performance sensitivity of this configuration."
