    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'commit_failure_policy' configuration is classified as performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly impacts the system's behavior in response to commit disk failures, leading to significant variations in system performance. The code snippet provided contains operations that are time-expensive, such as stopping transports or killing the JVM, based on the configured policy. These operations can have a notable impact on system performance at the system level, making the configuration performance-sensitive."
