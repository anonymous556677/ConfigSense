    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'counter_cache_size_in_mb' is classified as performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly impacts the memory usage and performance of the system by setting the maximum size of the counter cache in memory. The code snippet provided shows that the configuration is used to initialize the counter cache with the specified capacity in MBs, which can have a significant impact on memory consumption and performance. Additionally, the developer's understanding emphasizes the trade-offs between memory usage and performance when configuring this option, further highlighting its performance sensitivity."
