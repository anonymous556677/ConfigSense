    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'native_transport_max_threads' configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the system's performance at the system level. The code initializes an executor service with the configured value, which handles request processing asynchronously. The number of threads allocated for handling requests can significantly affect the system's throughput and response time. Setting this configuration too low can lead to processing bottlenecks, while setting it too high can result in excessive resource consumption. Therefore, the optimal configuration of 'native_transport_max_threads' is crucial for system performance."
