    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'range_request_timeout_in_ms' configuration is classified as performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly affects the timeout value for range RPC operations, which are critical for system performance. The code context shows that the 'getRangeRpcTimeout' method is called multiple times in different parts of the codebase to retrieve the range RPC timeout value. This timeout value is crucial for determining how long the coordinator should wait for sequential or index scans to complete, impacting the overall system performance. Therefore, any changes to this configuration can lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
