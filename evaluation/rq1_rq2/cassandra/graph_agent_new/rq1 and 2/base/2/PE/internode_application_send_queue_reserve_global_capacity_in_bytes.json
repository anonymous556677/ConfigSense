    "Reason": "The configuration 'internode_application_send_queue_reserve_global_capacity_in_bytes' does not appear to be performance-sensitive based on the provided code context and developer information. The code snippet provided in the context does not contain any performance-intensive operations related to this configuration. Additionally, the developer's explanation indicates that this configuration is primarily focused on managing message queue size for efficient message delivery and processing within the cluster, rather than directly impacting system performance at a significant level. Therefore, the configuration is not considered performance-sensitive."
