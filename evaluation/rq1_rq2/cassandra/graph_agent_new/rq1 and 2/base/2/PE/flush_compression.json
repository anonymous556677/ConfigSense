    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'flush_compression' configuration is performance-sensitive. This is because the selection of the compression algorithm during the flush process directly impacts the performance of flush operations for compressed tables. The code snippet provided shows that the configuration determines the compression parameters based on the operation type, and choosing a high ratio compressor can potentially block flushes for too long, leading to notable performance variations at the system level. Therefore, the configuration involves performance-related operations that are time-extensive and memory-extensive, resulting in significant performance impact."
