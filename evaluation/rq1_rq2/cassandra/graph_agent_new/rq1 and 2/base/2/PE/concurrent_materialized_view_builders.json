    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'concurrent_materialized_view_builders' configuration option is performance-sensitive. This is because it directly controls the number of simultaneous materialized view builder tasks that can run, which can significantly impact system performance by affecting resource usage and contention during the materialized view building process. The code context shows that this configuration is used to get and set the number of concurrent view builders, indicating its importance in managing system performance."
