    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'corrupted_tombstone_strategy' is performance-sensitive. The code related to this configuration involves operations that can be time-expensive and memory-expensive, such as checking for invalid deletions and handling invalid tombstones. Depending on the strategy set in the configuration ('exception' or 'warn'), it can lead to exceptions being thrown, marking SSTables as suspect, and affecting future compactions, which directly impacts system performance at the system level."
