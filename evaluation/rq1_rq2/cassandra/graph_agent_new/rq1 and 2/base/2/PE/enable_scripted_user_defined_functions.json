{
    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'enable_scripted_user_defined_functions' is performance-sensitive. This is because the code context shows that the configuration directly impacts the system performance by enabling or disabling scripted user-defined functions. Scripted user-defined functions can be time-expensive and memory-expensive operations, leading to notable performance variations at the system level. Additionally, the developer's understanding mentions that enabling this configuration introduces security risks, indicating that it has a substantial impact on the system. Therefore, based on the code context and the potential performance impact of scripted UDFs, the configuration is classified as performance-sensitive."
