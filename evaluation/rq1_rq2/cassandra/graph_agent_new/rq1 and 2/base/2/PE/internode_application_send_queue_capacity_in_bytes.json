    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'internode_application_send_queue_capacity_in_bytes' is performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly impacts the amount of memory used for queuing messages and can limit the number of messages that can be processed concurrently, leading to notable performance variations at the system level. The code context shows that the configuration determines the send queue capacity in bytes, which is crucial for message delivery and processing within the cluster. Therefore, any changes or limitations imposed by this configuration can have a significant impact on system performance."
