    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'native_transport_idle_timeout_in_ms' is performance-sensitive. This is because the idle timeout value set by this configuration directly impacts the system performance by controlling when idle client connections are closed. The code snippet related to this configuration adds an IdleStateHandler to the channel pipeline, which closes client connections after the specified idle timeout period. This operation is time-expensive and can lead to notable performance variations at the system level by efficiently managing resources and improving system efficiency."
