    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'internode_application_receive_queue_reserve_global_capacity_in_bytes' is performance-sensitive. This is because it directly impacts the memory usage of the system by determining the maximum amount of memory that can be allocated for messages queued for delivery between nodes in the cluster. Setting a higher value for this configuration can lead to better performance in handling message delivery, but an excessively high value may result in increased memory usage and potential resource contention. The code context provided does not show the exact implementation of this configuration, but based on the developer's explanation, it is clear that this configuration involves memory-expensive operations that can have a notable performance impact at the system level."
