{
    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'internode_streaming_tcp_user_timeout_in_ms' is classified as performance-sensitive. This classification is based on the fact that the configuration directly impacts the timeout for processing incoming stream messages, which are critical operations for system performance. The code snippet provided shows that if the processing time exceeds the configured timeout value, a warning is logged and the streaming connection might be closed. This indicates that the configuration has a direct and substantial effect on system performance at the system level, making it performance-sensitive."
