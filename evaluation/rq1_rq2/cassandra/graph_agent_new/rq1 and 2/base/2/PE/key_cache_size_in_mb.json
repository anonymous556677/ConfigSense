    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The key_cache_size_in_mb configuration is performance-sensitive. The code snippet initializes the key cache with a specified capacity in MBs, which directly impacts the memory usage of the system. The key cache size affects the performance by caching more keys, which can improve performance but also increases memory usage. Therefore, changing the key_cache_size_in_mb configuration can lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
