    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'stream_entire_sstables' is performance-sensitive. The code context provided shows that this configuration directly impacts the decision to stream entire SSTables between nodes based on specific conditions. Enabling this configuration can significantly affect system performance by speeding up network transfer and reducing GC pressure. The code snippet contains performance-related operations that contribute to execution time and memory consumption, leading to notable performance variations at the system level."
