This means that only partition information is held on heap and the index entries are read from disk.  Note that this size refers to the size of the serialized index information and not the size of the partition.",
    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The configuration 'column_index_cache_size_in_kb' is used to determine the size limit for sstable indexed key cache entries that will be held on heap. Entries exceeding this size will not be held on heap, meaning only partition information is held on heap and index entries are read from disk.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The triggering frequency of the 'column_index_cache_size_in_kb' configuration depends on the size of the serialized index information. Whenever the size of the serialized index information exceeds the specified cache size limit, the configuration is triggered.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the 'column_index_cache_size_in_kb' configuration option on the system is that it affects the memory usage and performance of the system. If the cache size limit is set too low, it may result in more index entries being read from disk, potentially impacting system performance. On the other hand, setting the cache size limit too high may lead to increased memory usage."
