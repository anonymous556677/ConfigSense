    "config_description": "Global, per-endpoint and per-connection limits imposed on messages queued for delivery to other nodes and waiting to be processed on arrival from other nodes in the cluster.  These limits are applied to the on-wire size of the message being sent or received.  The basic per-link limit is consumed in isolation before any endpoint or global limit is imposed. Each node-pair has three links: urgent, small and large.  So any given node may have a maximum of N*3*(internode_application_send_queue_capacity_in_bytes+internode_application_receive_queue_capacity_in_bytes) messages queued without any coordination between them although in practice, with token-aware routing, only RF*tokens nodes should need to communicate with significant bandwidth.  The per-endpoint limit is imposed on all messages exceeding the per-link limit, simultaneously with the global limit, on all links to or from a single node in the cluster. The global limit is imposed on all messages exceeding the per-link limit, simultaneously with the per-endpoint limit, on all links to or from any node in the cluster.  internode_application_send_queue_capacity_in_bytes: 4194304                       #4MiB internode_application_send_queue_reserve_endpoint_capacity_in_bytes: 134217728    #128MiB internode_application_send_queue_reserve_global_capacity_in_bytes: 536870912      #512MiB internode_application_receive_queue_capacity_in_bytes: 4194304                    #4MiB internode_application_receive_queue_reserve_endpoint_capacity_in_bytes: 134217728 #128MiB",
    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The configuration 'internode_application_receive_queue_reserve_global_capacity_in_bytes' is used to set the global reserve capacity for the receive queue in the messaging service. This configuration determines the maximum amount of memory that can be allocated for messages queued for delivery from other nodes in the cluster.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The configuration is triggered whenever a message needs to be queued for delivery to or from other nodes in the cluster. The triggering frequency depends on the volume of messages being sent and received in the system.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the 'internode_application_receive_queue_reserve_global_capacity_in_bytes' configuration option is significant as it directly affects the memory usage of the system. Setting a higher value for this configuration can increase the amount of memory allocated for message queues, potentially leading to better performance in handling message delivery. However, setting an excessively high value may also result in increased memory usage and potential resource contention."
