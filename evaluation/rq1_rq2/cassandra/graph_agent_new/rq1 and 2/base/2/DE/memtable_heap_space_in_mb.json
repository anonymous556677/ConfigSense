    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The configuration 'memtable_heap_space_in_mb' is used to set the total permitted memory to use for memtables in the system. The code snippet provided creates a MemtablePool based on the value of this configuration. The heapLimit and offHeapLimit are set based on the value of 'memtable_heap_space_in_mb' and 'memtable_offheap_space_in_mb' respectively. The MemtablePool is then created based on the 'memtable_allocation_type' specified in the configuration.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The triggering frequency of the 'memtable_heap_space_in_mb' configuration depends on the memtable_cleanup_threshold set in the configuration. When the total memory used for memtables exceeds the limit specified in 'memtable_heap_space_in_mb', Cassandra will stop accepting writes until a flush completes. The flush will be triggered based on the memtable_cleanup_threshold value.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the 'memtable_heap_space_in_mb' configuration option on the system is significant. If the memory limit specified is too low, it can lead to frequent flushes and potentially impact the performance of the system. On the other hand, if the memory limit is set too high, it can lead to increased memory usage and potential out-of-memory errors. It is crucial to set this configuration carefully to optimize the performance and stability of the system."
