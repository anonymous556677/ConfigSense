    "config_description": "Policy for commit disk failures:  die shut down the node and kill the JVM, so the node can be replaced.  stop shut down the node, leaving the node effectively dead, but can still be inspected via JMX.  stop_commit shutdown the commit log, letting writes collect but continuing to service reads, as in pre-2.0.5 Cassandra  ignore ignore fatal errors and let the batches fail",
    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The 'commit_failure_policy' configuration determines how the system handles commit disk failures. Depending on the policy set, the system either shuts down the node and kills the JVM, shuts down the node leaving it inspectable via JMX, shuts down the commit log while still servicing reads, or ignores fatal errors and lets batches fail.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The triggering frequency of the 'commit_failure_policy' configuration depends on the occurrence of commit log errors during initialization or commit log failures during normal operation. The frequency can vary based on the stability of the system and the frequency of commit log errors.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the 'commit_failure_policy' configuration option on the system is significant as it determines the behavior of the system in response to commit disk failures. Choosing a policy like 'die' can lead to node shutdown and JVM termination, affecting system availability, while choosing 'ignore' can allow fatal errors to propagate and potentially impact data consistency."
