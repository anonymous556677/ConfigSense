    "config_description": "phi value that must be reached for a host to be marked down. most users should never need to adjust this.",
    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The configuration 'phi_convict_threshold' is used in the code to determine the phi value that must be reached for a host to be marked down. It is checked in the 'convict' method to decide whether to mark an endpoint as failed.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The triggering frequency of the 'phi_convict_threshold' configuration depends on the failure detection mechanism and the frequency of endpoint checks. It is triggered whenever the 'convict' method is called and the phi value is compared against 2 times the 'phi_convict_threshold'. The frequency can vary based on the network conditions and the number of endpoints being monitored.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the 'phi_convict_threshold' configuration option is significant as it directly affects the failure detection and marking of endpoints as failed. Setting a higher threshold can result in longer detection times for failed hosts, potentially impacting the overall system availability. On the other hand, setting a lower threshold may lead to false positives and unnecessary marking of hosts as failed."
