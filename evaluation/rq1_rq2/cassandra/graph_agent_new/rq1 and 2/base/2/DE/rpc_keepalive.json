    "config_description": "enable or disable keepalive on rpc/native connections",
    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The rpc_keepalive configuration in the code determines whether keepalive is enabled or disabled on rpc/native connections. It is used to control the behavior of the connections in terms of keepalive functionality.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The triggering frequency of the rpc_keepalive configuration in the system depends on the specific use case and workload. If keepalive is enabled, the system will periodically send keepalive packets to maintain the connection. If keepalive is disabled, the system will not send keepalive packets.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the rpc_keepalive configuration option on the system is significant. Enabling keepalive can help maintain idle connections and prevent them from being closed prematurely, which can improve performance and reduce connection setup overhead. However, enabling keepalive may also consume additional resources and increase network traffic."
