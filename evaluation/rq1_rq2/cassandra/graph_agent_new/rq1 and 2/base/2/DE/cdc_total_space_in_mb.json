If space gets above this value, Cassandra will throw WriteTimeoutException on Mutations including tables with CDC enabled. A CDCCompactor is responsible for parsing the raw CDC logs and deleting them when parsing is completed.  The default value is the min of 4096 mb and 1/8th of the total space of the drive where cdc_raw_directory resides.",
    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The configuration code 'cdc_total_space_in_mb' is used to determine the total space available for change-data-capture logs on disk. It multiplies the value of 'CDCSpaceInMB' obtained from the DatabaseDescriptor by 1024 * 1024 to convert it to bytes.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The configuration 'cdc_total_space_in_mb' is triggered whenever there is a need to calculate the total space available for change-data-capture logs on disk. This could happen when initializing the system or when there is a change in the configuration value.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the 'cdc_total_space_in_mb' configuration option is significant as it determines the threshold for space usage for change-data-capture logs. If the space usage exceeds this value, Cassandra will throw WriteTimeoutException on Mutations including tables with CDC enabled. This can lead to disruptions in data processing and potentially affect the system's performance."
