If disabled, replicas will assume that requests were forwarded to them instantly by the coordinator, which means that under overload conditions we will waste that much extra time processing already-timed-out requests.  Warning: It is generally assumed that users have setup NTP on their clusters, and that clocks are modestly in sync, since this is a requirement for general correctness of last write wins.",
    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The 'cross_node_timeout' configuration is checked in the getExpiresAtNanos method to determine if operation timeout information exchange between nodes should be enabled. If the DatabaseDescriptor hasCrossNodeTimeout() returns false or the createdAtNanos is greater than the currentTimeNanos, the createdAtNanos is set to currentTimeNanos. The method then calculates and returns the expiration time in nanoseconds.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The triggering frequency of the 'cross_node_timeout' configuration depends on the calls to the getExpiresAtNanos method in the codebase. The frequency can vary based on how often this method is called during the execution of the system.",

If disabled, replicas may incorrectly assume that requests were forwarded instantly by the coordinator, leading to wasted processing time on already-timed-out requests under overload conditions. It is important to note that this configuration assumes that users have set up NTP on their clusters and that clocks are reasonably in sync for the correctness of last write wins."
