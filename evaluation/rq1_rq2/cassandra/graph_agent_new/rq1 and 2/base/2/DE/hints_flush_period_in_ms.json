    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The configuration 'hints_flush_period_in_ms' determines how often hints should be flushed from the internal buffers to disk. This is set in milliseconds and is used to schedule a periodic task that flushes the buffers.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The configuration is triggered in the system by scheduling a task with a fixed delay using the value of 'hints_flush_period_in_ms'. This means that the flushing of hints from the buffers to disk occurs at regular intervals based on the configured value.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the 'hints_flush_period_in_ms' configuration option on the system is that it affects the frequency at which hints are persisted to disk. A smaller value will result in more frequent flushing of hints, potentially impacting system performance due to increased disk I/O operations. On the other hand, a larger value may delay the persistence of hints to disk, which could impact data durability in case of failures."
