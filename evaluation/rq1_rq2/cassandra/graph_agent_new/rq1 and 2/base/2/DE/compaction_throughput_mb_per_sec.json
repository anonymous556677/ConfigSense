The faster you insert data, the faster you need to compact in order to keep the sstable count down, but in general, setting this to 16 to 32 times the rate you are inserting data is more than sufficient. Setting this to 0 disables throttling. Note that this accounts for all types of compaction, including validation compaction (building Merkle trees for repairs).",

Setting it to an appropriate value helps in controlling the speed of compaction relative to data insertion rates, thereby optimizing system performance. Setting it to 0 disables throttling, which can lead to uncontrolled compaction and potential performance issues."
