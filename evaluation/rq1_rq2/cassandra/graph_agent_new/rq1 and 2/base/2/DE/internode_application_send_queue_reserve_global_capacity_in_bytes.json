These limits are applied to the on-wire size of the message being sent or received.  The basic per-link limit is consumed in isolation before any endpoint or global limit is imposed. Each node-pair has three links: urgent, small and large.  So any given node may have a maximum of N*3*(internode_application_send_queue_capacity_in_bytes+internode_application_receive_queue_capacity_in_bytes) messages queued without any coordination between them although in practice, with token-aware routing, only RF*tokens nodes should need to communicate with significant bandwidth.  The per-endpoint limit is imposed on all messages exceeding the per-link limit, simultaneously with the global limit, on all links to or from a single node in the cluster. The global limit is imposed on all messages exceeding the per-link limit, simultaneously with the per-endpoint limit, on all links to or from any node in the cluster.  internode_application_send_queue_capacity_in_bytes: 4194304                       #4MiB internode_application_send_queue_reserve_endpoint_capacity_in_bytes: 134217728    #128MiB",

These limits are applied to the on-wire size of the message being sent or received. The configuration works by imposing global, per-endpoint, and per-connection limits on the queued messages.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The configuration is triggered whenever messages are queued for delivery to other nodes or waiting to be processed on arrival from other nodes in the cluster. The triggering frequency depends on the volume of messages being sent and received in the system.",

By setting appropriate limits, the configuration ensures efficient message delivery and processing within the cluster."
