    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The triggering frequency of the 'internode_tcp_connect_timeout_in_ms' configuration depends on the network conditions and the frequency of internode tcp connections in the system. It is triggered whenever a tcp connection needs to be established between nodes in the Cassandra cluster.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the 'internode_tcp_connect_timeout_in_ms' configuration option on the system is related to the stability and performance of internode communication in the Cassandra cluster. Setting a higher timeout value may increase the time taken to establish tcp connections between nodes, potentially impacting the overall responsiveness and reliability of the system. On the other hand, setting a lower timeout value may lead to quicker connection establishment but could also increase the risk of network partitions and communication failures."
