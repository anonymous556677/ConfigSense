    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'snapshot_links_per_second' is performance-sensitive. This is because the 'snapshot_links_per_second' value directly influences the rate at which snapshot links are created or cleared in the system, which can have a significant impact on system performance, especially on consumer grade SSDs. The code context shows that the 'getSnapshotRateLimiter' method uses the 'snapshot_links_per_second' value to create a RateLimiter object, indicating that the configuration is directly involved in performance-related operations. Additionally, the 'getSnapshotLinksPerSecond' method retrieves the 'snapshot_links_per_second' value from the configuration and returns it, further emphasizing the performance impact of this configuration."
