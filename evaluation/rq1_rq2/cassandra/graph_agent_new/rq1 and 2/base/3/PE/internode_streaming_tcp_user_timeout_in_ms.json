    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'internode_streaming_tcp_user_timeout_in_ms' is classified as performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly impacts the performance of streaming connections in the system. The code snippet provided shows that the processing time of incoming stream messages is compared against this timeout value, and if the processing time exceeds the configured timeout, a warning is logged. This indicates that the configuration has a direct impact on the performance of streaming operations at the system level, making it performance-sensitive."
