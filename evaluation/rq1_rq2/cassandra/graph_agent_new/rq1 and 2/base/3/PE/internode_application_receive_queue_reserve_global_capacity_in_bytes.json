    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'internode_application_receive_queue_reserve_global_capacity_in_bytes' is classified as performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly impacts the global limit on the size of messages queued for delivery and waiting to be processed between nodes in the cluster. The size of messages queued for delivery or processing can have a significant impact on system performance, as it can affect the system's memory consumption and message processing efficiency. Therefore, any changes to this configuration can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, making it performance-sensitive."
