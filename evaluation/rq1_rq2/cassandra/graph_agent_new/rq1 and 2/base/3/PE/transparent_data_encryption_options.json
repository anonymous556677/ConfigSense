    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'transparent_data_encryption_options' is performance-sensitive. The code context provided shows that this configuration involves encryption and decryption operations for data at-rest, which can be time-expensive and memory-expensive. These operations directly impact system performance at the system level by adding an additional layer of security through encryption. The triggering frequency of this configuration is tied to writing data to commitlog or hints files, which can lead to notable performance variations due to the overhead of encryption and decryption. Therefore, the configuration is considered performance-sensitive."
