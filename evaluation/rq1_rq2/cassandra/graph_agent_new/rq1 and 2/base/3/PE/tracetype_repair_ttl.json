    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'tracetype_repair_ttl' configuration is performance-sensitive. This is because the TTL value directly impacts the storage space used to store repair trace sessions, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The configuration involves time-expensive and memory-expensive operations related to managing trace sessions and determining their TTL values. Additionally, the frequency of triggering the configuration is tied to repair operations, which can have a significant impact on system performance. Therefore, the configuration is considered performance-sensitive based on its direct and substantial effect on system performance."
