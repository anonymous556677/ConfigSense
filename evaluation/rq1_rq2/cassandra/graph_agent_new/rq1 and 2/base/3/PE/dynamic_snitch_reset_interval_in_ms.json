    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'dynamic_snitch_reset_interval_in_ms' is performance-sensitive. This is because the value of this configuration directly impacts the frequency at which host scores are reset in the dynamic endpoint snitch of Cassandra. The code snippet provided shows that the dynamicResetInterval value is used to schedule tasks for updating and resetting host scores. This operation is time-expensive and memory-expensive as it involves periodic calculations and adjustments to host scores, which can have a notable performance variation at the system level. Therefore, any changes to this configuration can significantly affect the performance and reliability of the system."
