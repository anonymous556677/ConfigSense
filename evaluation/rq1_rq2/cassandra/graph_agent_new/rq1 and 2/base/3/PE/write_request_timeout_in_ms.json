    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'write_request_timeout_in_ms' is performance-sensitive. This is because it directly affects the timeout duration for write operations in the system. The timeout value set by this configuration can impact the overall performance of the system by influencing the completion time of write operations. The 'write_request_timeout_in_ms' configuration is used in various parts of the code to set timeouts for write operations, and any significant variation in this value can lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
