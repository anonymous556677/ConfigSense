    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'index_summary_capacity_in_mb' is considered performance-sensitive because it directly affects the memory usage of all index summaries in the system. The code snippet provided initializes the IndexSummaryManager with the memory pool size obtained from the configuration, which can have a significant impact on memory consumption at the system level. Additionally, the configuration involves setting a limit on memory usage, which can lead to notable performance variations if the memory usage exceeds the configured limit. Therefore, the configuration is performance-sensitive based on its impact on memory consumption and system performance."
