    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'initial_token' configuration option is classified as performance-sensitive. This is because the 'initial_token' configuration directly impacts the token assignment for nodes in the cluster, which can affect the distribution of data across the cluster and potentially impact performance and load balancing at the system level. The code context shows that the configuration involves performance-related operations such as token allocation algorithms and token generation, which can lead to notable performance variations in the system."
