    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'enable_user_defined_functions' is performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly affects the behavior of the assertUdfsEnabled method, which is triggered whenever user-defined functions need to be executed. The method checks if user-defined functions are enabled in the cassandra.yaml file, and if not, it throws an InvalidRequestException. Enabling or disabling user-defined functions can have a significant impact on system performance, as it affects the execution of custom functions in queries and introduces security risks. Therefore, the configuration's impact on the system level performance and its direct involvement in time-expensive operations make it performance-sensitive."
