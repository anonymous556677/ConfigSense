    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'allocate_tokens_for_keyspace' is performance-sensitive. This is because the code context shows that the configuration directly impacts the token allocation process for new nodes joining the cluster. The allocationKeyspace parameter triggers a token allocation algorithm, which can have a significant impact on the distribution of data across the cluster. This can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, affecting performance and load balancing. The configuration involves performance-related operations that are time-expensive and memory-expensive, making it performance-sensitive."
