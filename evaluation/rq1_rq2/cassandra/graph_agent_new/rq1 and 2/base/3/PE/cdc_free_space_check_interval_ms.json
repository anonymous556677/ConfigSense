{
    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'cdc_free_space_check_interval_ms' is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the configuration directly impacts the system's performance by triggering a check for available space for cdc-tracked tables at an interval of 250ms. This check involves time-expensive operations such as recalculating overflow size and processing new segments, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Additionally, the configuration-related code contains methods like 'allocate' that contribute to execution time and memory consumption, further emphasizing its performance sensitivity."
