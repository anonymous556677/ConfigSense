    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'native_transport_max_frame_size_in_mb' is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the configuration directly impacts the maximum size of frames that the system can handle. Changing this configuration can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, especially in terms of memory consumption. The code related to this configuration involves operations that deal with frame size validation and handling, which are time-expensive and memory-expensive. Therefore, any changes to this configuration can have a significant impact on system performance."
