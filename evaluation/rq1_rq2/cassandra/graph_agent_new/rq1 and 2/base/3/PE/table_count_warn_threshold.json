    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'table_count_warn_threshold' configuration is performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly impacts the system performance by setting a threshold for the number of tables in the cluster. If the number of tables exceeds this threshold, a warning message is logged and returned to the client, affecting the execution time and memory consumption. The code context shows that the configuration is used to determine when to send client warnings based on the number of tables/keyspaces, which can significantly slow down schema-dependent cluster operations. Therefore, the configuration involves performance-related operations that lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
