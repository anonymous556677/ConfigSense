    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The 'cached_rows_warn_threshold' configuration option is not performance-sensitive based on the provided code context and developer's information. The configuration is used to limit the number of rows from replicas to prevent severely out-of-date replicas from causing damage during queries. It is set as a per-query threshold at which a warning will be logged. The configuration does not involve any performance-related operations that are time-extensive or memory-extensive within its related code. It does not directly and substantially affect system performance at the system level, and it does not lead to notable performance variations."
