    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'counter_cache_size_in_mb' configuration is performance-sensitive. This configuration directly impacts the system performance by determining the maximum size of the counter cache in memory. The size of the cache affects the efficiency of read operations and contention for hot counter cells, leading to notable performance variations at the system level. The configuration-related code snippet involves time-expensive operations such as calculating the cache capacity based on the configured size, initializing the cache with the specified capacity, and scheduling periodic saving based on the configured parameters, all of which contribute to significant performance impact."
