    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The 'auto_snapshot' configuration option is not performance-sensitive based on the provided code context and developer information. The configuration mainly deals with taking a snapshot before keyspace truncation or dropping of column families for data safety. The code related to the configuration does not involve any time-expensive or memory-expensive operations that would lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Therefore, the configuration is not classified as performance-sensitive."
