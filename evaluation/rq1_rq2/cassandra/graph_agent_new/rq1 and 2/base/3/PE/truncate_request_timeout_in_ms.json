    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'truncate_request_timeout_in_ms' is classified as performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the configuration directly impacts the timeout for truncates to complete, which can significantly affect system performance. The code snippets related to this configuration involve time-expensive operations such as waiting for truncates to complete within a specified timeout. Any changes to this configuration can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, making it a performance-sensitive configuration."
