{
    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'internode_socket_send_buffer_size_in_bytes' is classified as performance-sensitive. The code context shows that this configuration directly impacts the socket buffer size for internode communication, which can significantly affect the performance and efficiency of internode communication in the system. The configuration involves performance-related operations related to network optimization, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The developer's explanation also confirms that the configuration is triggered whenever the socket buffer size needs to be set or updated, further emphasizing its performance sensitivity."
