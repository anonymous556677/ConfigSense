    "Reason": "The configuration option 'cdc_total_space_in_mb' is performance-sensitive. The code snippet provided shows that this configuration directly impacts the total space available for change-data-capture logs on disk. If the allocated space for CDC logs exceeds the specified total space, it can lead to WriteTimeoutException on Mutations, affecting system performance and reliability. The configuration involves time-expensive operations like multiplication and conversion, and it directly influences system performance at the system level by determining the space available for critical logs."
