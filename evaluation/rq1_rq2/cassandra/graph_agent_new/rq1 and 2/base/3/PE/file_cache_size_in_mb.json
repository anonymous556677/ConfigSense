    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'file_cache_size_in_mb' configuration is performance-sensitive. The configuration directly determines the amount of memory allocated for the sstable chunk cache and buffer pooling in the system. The calculation of the cache size based on this configuration involves time-expensive and memory-expensive operations, such as the initialization of the ChunkCache class and the allocation of buffers. Changes in this configuration can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, impacting read performance and overall system resource utilization."
