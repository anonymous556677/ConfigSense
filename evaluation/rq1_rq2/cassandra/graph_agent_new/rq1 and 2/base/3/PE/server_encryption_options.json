    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'server_encryption_options' configuration is performance-sensitive. This is because it involves setting up SSL contexts, creating SSL sockets, and managing SSL certificates for server-to-server internode encryption. These operations are time-expensive and memory-expensive, directly impacting system performance at the system level. Additionally, the configuration triggers periodic checks for SSL certificate updates, which can lead to notable performance variations in the system."
