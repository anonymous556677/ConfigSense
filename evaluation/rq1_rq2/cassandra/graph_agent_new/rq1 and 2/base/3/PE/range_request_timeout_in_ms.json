    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'range_request_timeout_in_ms' is classified as performance-sensitive. This classification is based on the fact that the 'getRangeRpcTimeout' method, which is related to this configuration, directly affects the timeout duration for range and index scans. The code snippets provided show that this configuration is crucial for determining the maximum time allowed for these operations to complete. Any changes to this configuration can have a significant impact on the overall system performance, as it directly influences the execution time of these time-expensive operations. Therefore, the configuration is considered performance-sensitive due to its direct and substantial effect on system performance at the system level."
