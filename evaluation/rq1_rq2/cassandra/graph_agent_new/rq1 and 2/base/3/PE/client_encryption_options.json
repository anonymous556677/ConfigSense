    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'client_encryption_options' is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the configuration involves creating and caching SSL contexts, which are time-expensive and memory-expensive operations. These operations directly impact system performance at the system level by consuming a lot of resources, especially direct memory, and by handling encryption policies that affect the secure communication between clients and servers. Additionally, the configuration code is responsible for setting up encryption for client-to-server communication, which is crucial for system security and performance."
