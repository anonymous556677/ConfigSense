    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'memtable_allocation_type' configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly determines how Cassandra allocates and manages memtable memory, leading to the creation of different memory pools with specific limits and cleaning thresholds. The code snippet provided shows that the configuration influences the type of memory pool created based on the allocation type chosen. This allocation type directly impacts memory usage and performance at the system level, making it a performance-sensitive configuration."
