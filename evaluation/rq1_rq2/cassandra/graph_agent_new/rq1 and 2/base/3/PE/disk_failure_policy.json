    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'disk_failure_policy' configuration is classified as performance-sensitive. This classification is based on the fact that the configuration directly influences the system's response to disk failures and errors, which can have a significant impact on system performance. The code snippet related to the configuration shows that different policies trigger actions like stopping transports, killing the JVM, and marking paths as unwritable, all of which are time-expensive and memory-expensive operations. These operations can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, making the configuration performance-sensitive."
