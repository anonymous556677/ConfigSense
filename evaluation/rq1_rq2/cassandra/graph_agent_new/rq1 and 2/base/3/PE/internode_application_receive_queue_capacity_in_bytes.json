    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'internode_application_receive_queue_capacity_in_bytes' is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the memory consumption of the system at the system level. The code snippet related to this configuration shows that it controls the amount of memory allocated for incoming messages on a per-endpoint and per-connection basis. Setting this configuration too low may result in dropped messages or slow processing, while setting it too high may lead to increased memory usage and potential performance issues due to memory pressure."
