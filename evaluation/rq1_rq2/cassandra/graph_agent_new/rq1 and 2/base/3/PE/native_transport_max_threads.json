    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'native_transport_max_threads' configuration is performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly impacts the maximum number of threads used for handling requests in the native transport layer. The code snippet provided shows that this configuration is crucial for creating the requestExecutor, which is responsible for processing incoming requests. The number of threads allocated can significantly affect the system's performance and scalability. Setting this configuration too low can lead to bottlenecks and performance degradation, while setting it too high can result in excessive resource consumption. Therefore, any changes to this configuration can have a notable impact on the system's overall performance."
