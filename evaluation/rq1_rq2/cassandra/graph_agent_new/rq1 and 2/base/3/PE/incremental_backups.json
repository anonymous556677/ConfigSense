    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'incremental_backups' configuration is performance-sensitive. The method maybeIncrementallyBackup involves creating hard links to SSTables, which can be time-expensive and memory-expensive operations. This can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, especially when dealing with a large number of SSTables. Additionally, the configuration directly impacts system performance by determining whether incremental backups are enabled, which is crucial for data protection and recovery. Therefore, the configuration is considered performance-sensitive based on the significant performance impact it has on the system."
