    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'concurrent_materialized_view_writes' configuration is classified as performance-sensitive. This classification is based on the fact that the configuration directly impacts the system's performance by managing the concurrency of materialized view operations. The code context reveals that the configuration involves operations that can be time-expensive, such as updating, adding, or removing materialized views. These operations can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, making the configuration performance-sensitive."
