    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'native_transport_flush_in_batches_legacy' is classified as performance-sensitive. This is because enabling this configuration directly affects system performance at the system level by improving throughput, especially for systems with older kernels or fewer client connections. The code context reveals that this configuration involves performance-related operations such as native transport TCP message coalescing, which can have a notable impact on system performance. Therefore, based on the code context and developer's information, it is evident that the configuration is performance-sensitive."
