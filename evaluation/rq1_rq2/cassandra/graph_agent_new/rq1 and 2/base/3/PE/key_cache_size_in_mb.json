    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'key_cache_size_in_mb' configuration is performance-sensitive. The code initializes the key cache with the specified capacity in MBs, which directly impacts the memory usage and performance of the system. The size of the key cache affects the number of seeks required for cache hits, thus influencing the overall system performance. Additionally, the configuration involves time-expensive and memory-expensive operations, such as setting up the cache with the specified size and scheduling cache saving, which contribute to notable performance variations at the system level."
