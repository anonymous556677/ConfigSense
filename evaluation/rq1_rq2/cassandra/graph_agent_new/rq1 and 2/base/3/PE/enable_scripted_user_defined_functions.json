    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'enable_scripted_user_defined_functions' is performance-sensitive. This is because the code context shows that the configuration directly impacts the behavior of the system by enabling or disabling scripted user-defined functions. Scripted user-defined functions can introduce time-expensive operations due to the execution of custom logic written in JavaScript or other scripting languages. Enabling this configuration can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, especially when executing scripted UDFs. Additionally, the developer's understanding mentions the security risks associated with using scripted UDFs, indicating that the configuration has significant implications beyond just performance."
