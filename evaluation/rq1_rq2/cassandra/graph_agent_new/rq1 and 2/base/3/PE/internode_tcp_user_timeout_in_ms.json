{
    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'internode_tcp_user_timeout_in_ms' is performance-sensitive. This classification is based on the fact that the configuration directly impacts the amount of time allowed for internode TCP connections to establish in Cassandra, which can have a significant effect on system performance. The code snippet provided shows that the configuration is used in determining the timeout value for TCP connections, which is a time-expensive operation. Additionally, the configuration involves performance-related operations that contribute to notable performance variations at the system level, making it performance-sensitive."
