    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'compaction_throughput_mb_per_sec' is performance-sensitive. The code context shows that this configuration is used to set the rate limit for compaction operations, which directly impacts the speed of compaction and overall system performance. By adjusting this configuration, the system can experience notable performance variations at the system level. Additionally, the developer's understanding on the working and size impact of this configuration further supports its performance sensitivity, as it directly affects the execution time and memory consumption of compaction operations."
