    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'enable_drop_compact_storage' is performance-sensitive. This classification is based on the fact that the configuration directly impacts the ability to use 'ALTER ... DROP COMPACT STORAGE' statements on tables, which can have a significant performance impact on system operations related to table storage and data organization. The code snippets related to this configuration involve validation checks and flag setting operations that are time-expensive and memory-expensive, leading to notable performance variations at the system level. The triggering frequency of this configuration is tied to the execution of 'ALTER ... DROP COMPACT STORAGE' statements, which indicates its importance in system performance. Therefore, considering the direct and substantial effect of this configuration on system performance, it is classified as performance-sensitive."
