    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'sstable_preemptive_open_interval_in_mb' is performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly impacts the interval at which replacement sstables are opened preemptively during compaction, affecting the system's read performance and overall system performance. The code snippet provided shows that the configuration is used to calculate the open interval based on certain conditions, and the interval can have a significant impact on system performance. Therefore, the configuration involves performance-related operations that are time-expensive and memory-expensive, leading to notable performance variations at the system level."
