    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'native_transport_idle_timeout_in_ms' is performance-sensitive. The code context provided shows that this configuration directly influences the idle timeout for client connections. By setting a positive idle timeout value, an IdleStateHandler is added to the channel's pipeline, which will close idle client connections after the specified idle timeout period if no reads or writes occur. This operation can have a notable performance impact at the system level by managing and freeing up resources, preventing resource exhaustion, and improving overall system performance. Therefore, the configuration is considered performance-sensitive based on its direct and substantial effect on system performance."
