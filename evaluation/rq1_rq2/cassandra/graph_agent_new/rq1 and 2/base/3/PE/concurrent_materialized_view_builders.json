    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'concurrent_materialized_view_builders' configuration is performance-sensitive. This is because it directly affects the number of simultaneous materialized view builder tasks allowed, which can impact the performance of compaction tasks involving materialized views. The configuration setting influences the level of parallelism and resource consumption in the system, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
