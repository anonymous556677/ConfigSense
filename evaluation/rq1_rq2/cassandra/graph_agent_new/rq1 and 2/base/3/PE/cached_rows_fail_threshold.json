    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'cached_rows_fail_threshold' configuration is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the configuration directly affects the fail threshold for cached replica rows, which in turn impacts the resolution process with replica filtering protection. The configuration is used as a parameter in the ReplicaFilteringProtection constructor, which plays a crucial role in ensuring data consistency and query results. Setting the fail threshold too low can lead to more rows being marked as failed, potentially affecting system performance and query efficiency at the system level."
