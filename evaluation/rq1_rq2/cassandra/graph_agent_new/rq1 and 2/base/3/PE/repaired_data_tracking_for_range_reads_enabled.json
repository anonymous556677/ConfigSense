    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'repaired_data_tracking_for_range_reads_enabled' is performance-sensitive. The code context shows that enabling this configuration involves additional operations for tracking and comparing repaired data during range reads. This can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, especially when there are multiple full replicas to compare results from. The configuration directly impacts the execution time and memory consumption of range read operations, making it performance-sensitive. The developer's understanding also confirms that enabling this configuration adds overhead to the system and can impact performance and resource utilization."
