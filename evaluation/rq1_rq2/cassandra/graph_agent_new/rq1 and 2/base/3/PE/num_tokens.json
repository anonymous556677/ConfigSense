    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'num_tokens' configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the distribution of data across the cluster, affecting the system's overall performance. The code snippet related to the configuration involves operations that check the number of tokens and handle the allocation of tokens, which are time-expensive and memory-expensive operations. Changing the number of tokens can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, making it a performance-sensitive configuration."
