    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'stream_throughput_outbound_megabits_per_sec' is classified as performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly controls the throughput of outbound streaming file transfers between datacenters, impacting the rate at which data can be transferred. The 'setStreamThroughputMbPerSec' method is time-expensive as it involves updating the throughput value, and the 'calculateRateInBytes' method is memory-expensive as it calculates the rate in bytes based on the configured throughput. These operations have a direct and substantial effect on system performance by potentially limiting or increasing data transfer rates, leading to notable performance variations at the system level."
