    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'enable_sasi_indexes' configuration option is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the system's performance by enabling the creation of SASI indexes. SASI indexes are known to have a notable performance impact on the system due to their experimental nature and potential resource utilization. The code snippet provided checks for the configuration setting in cassandra.yaml before allowing the creation of SASI indexes, indicating that this configuration can lead to significant performance variations at the system level."
