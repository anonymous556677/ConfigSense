    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'ideal_consistency_level' configuration is performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration involves additional tracking and comparison logic for each write operation in the system. The code snippet related to the configuration includes operations that contribute to execution time and memory consumption, such as comparing ideal consistency level with requested consistency level for each write. These operations can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, making the configuration performance-sensitive."
