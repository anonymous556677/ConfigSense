    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'commit_failure_policy' configuration is classified as performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly affects the behavior of the system when commit errors occur, leading to notable performance variations at the system level. The code snippet related to the configuration includes operations that can be time-expensive, such as stopping transports or killing the current JVM, which can impact system performance significantly. Therefore, the configuration is considered performance-sensitive based on its direct and substantial impact on system performance."
