{
    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'native_transport_max_concurrent_connections_per_ip' is performance-sensitive. This is because the code snippet related to this configuration involves checking the number of connections per IP and closing the connection if it exceeds the configured limit. This operation directly impacts system performance by controlling the number of concurrent connections per source IP, which can have a significant impact on resource utilization and potential denial of service attacks. Therefore, the configuration is considered performance-sensitive based on the code context and its impact on system-level performance."
