{
    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'internode_tcp_connect_timeout_in_ms' is classified as performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly affects the time it takes to establish internode tcp connections, which can have a significant impact on system performance. The code context shows that the method tcpConnectTimeoutInMS() returns the value of the configuration, indicating that it is used in performance-related operations. Additionally, the developer's explanation of the configuration's impact on system latency further supports its classification as performance-sensitive."
