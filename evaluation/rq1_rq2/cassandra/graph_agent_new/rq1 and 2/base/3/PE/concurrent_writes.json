    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'concurrent_writes' configuration is performance-sensitive. The configuration directly affects the number of concurrent writers allowed in the system, which in turn impacts the contention for locks in critical sections of the code related to PaxosState operations. The initialization of Striped locks based on the configuration value indicates that the system's performance can be notably affected by the number of concurrent writers. Contention for locks due to misconfigurations of this value can lead to performance degradation at the system level, making it a performance-sensitive configuration."
