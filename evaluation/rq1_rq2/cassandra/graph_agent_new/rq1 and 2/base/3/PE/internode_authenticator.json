    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The 'internode_authenticator' configuration option is not considered performance-sensitive based on the provided code context and developer information. The configuration mainly deals with setting the internode authentication backend for peer node connections, which is more focused on security and communication aspects rather than directly impacting performance at the system level. The code related to this configuration does not contain any time-expensive or memory-expensive operations that would lead to notable performance variations. Therefore, the configuration is more security-sensitive rather than performance-sensitive."
