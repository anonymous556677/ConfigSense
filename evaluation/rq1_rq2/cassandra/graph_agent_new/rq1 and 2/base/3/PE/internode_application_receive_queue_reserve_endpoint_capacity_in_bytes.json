    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'internode_application_receive_queue_reserve_endpoint_capacity_in_bytes' is performance-sensitive. This is because it directly impacts the system's performance at the system level by setting the per-endpoint limit on messages queued for delivery and processing. The configuration controls the memory consumption of queued messages, which is crucial for preventing memory exhaustion and ensuring efficient communication between nodes in the cluster. The code context reveals that this configuration is essential for managing the flow of messages between nodes, which can significantly affect the overall performance of the system."
