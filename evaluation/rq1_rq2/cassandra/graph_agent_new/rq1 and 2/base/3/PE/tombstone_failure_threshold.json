    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'tombstone_failure_threshold' configuration is performance-sensitive. The configuration directly affects the system's performance by setting a threshold for tombstones. If the number of tombstones exceeds this threshold, a 'TombstoneOverwhelmingException' is thrown, impacting the system's performance and stability. The configuration involves performance-related operations like tracking tombstones and throwing exceptions based on the threshold, leading to notable performance variations at the system level."
