    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'tracetype_query_ttl' is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the 'tracetype_query_ttl' configuration directly impacts the TTL (Time to Live) value for different trace types during the logging of the repair process. The TTL value affects the storage size required to store trace information, and setting a higher TTL value can significantly increase storage space usage. Additionally, the configuration involves performance-related operations such as retrieving TTL values based on the ordinal value of the TraceType enum, which can contribute to notable performance variations at the system level."
