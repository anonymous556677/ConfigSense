    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'repair_session_space_in_mb' configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the memory usage during Merkle tree calculations, which are time-expensive operations. The configuration setting determines the available bytes for holding RF trees in memory during validation compaction, affecting the overall system performance. The code context shows that the configuration value is used to calculate the available memory for creating Merkle trees, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level based on the memory constraints and performance requirements of the system."
