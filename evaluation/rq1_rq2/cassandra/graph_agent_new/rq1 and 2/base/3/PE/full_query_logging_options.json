    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'full_query_logging_options' is performance-sensitive. This classification is based on the fact that the 'getFullQueryLoggerOptions()' method retrieves configuration options that directly impact the behavior of full query logging, including log directory, roll cycle, blocking behavior, queue weight, log size, archive command, and archive retries. These configuration options can significantly affect system performance by influencing the amount of data logged, the frequency of log rotations, and the resources consumed during logging operations. Additionally, the 'enableFullQueryLogger()' method allows for customization of these options, further emphasizing the performance impact of this configuration."
