    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'network_authorizer' configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts system performance at the system level. The configuration involves operations like checking user permissions, managing access to data centers, and verifying login privileges, which are time-expensive and memory-expensive operations. These operations can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, making the configuration performance-sensitive."
