    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'memtable_cleanup_threshold' is classified as performance-sensitive. This is because the value of 'memtable_cleanup_threshold' directly impacts the triggering of flushing the largest memtable, which is a time-expensive operation affecting system performance. The code context shows that the 'cleaningThreshold' value is used in creating different types of MemtablePools based on the 'memtableAllocationType', indicating its direct influence on memory-expensive operations. The developer's explanation also highlights the significant impact of 'memtable_cleanup_threshold' on the frequency and size of memtable flushes, making it a crucial factor in system performance."
