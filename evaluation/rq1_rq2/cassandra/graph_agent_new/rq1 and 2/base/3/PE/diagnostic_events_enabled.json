    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'diagnostic_events_enabled' is performance-sensitive. This is because the 'diagnostic_events_enabled' configuration directly impacts the system performance by determining whether diagnostic events should be enabled or not. The code context shows that this configuration is checked in multiple methods to decide if events should be published or subscribers should be notified. Enabling or disabling diagnostic events can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, as it affects the execution time and memory consumption of handling diagnostic events."
