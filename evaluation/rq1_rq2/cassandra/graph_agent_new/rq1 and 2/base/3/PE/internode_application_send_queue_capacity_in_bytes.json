    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'internode_application_send_queue_capacity_in_bytes' is classified as performance-sensitive. This is because the capacity set by this configuration directly impacts the flow of messages between nodes in the cluster, affecting the system's performance. Setting this value too low can lead to message drops or delays, while setting it too high can consume excessive memory and impact performance. The code context shows that this configuration is crucial for managing the send queue capacity, which can have a significant impact on system performance at the system level."
