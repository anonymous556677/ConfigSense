    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'inter_dc_tcp_nodelay' is classified as performance-sensitive. The code context shows that the configuration directly impacts the behavior of tcp_nodelay for inter-dc communication, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Enabling or disabling tcp_nodelay affects the size of network packets being sent, potentially increasing latency for cross-datacenter responses. Additionally, the triggering frequency of the configuration depends on the frequency of inter-dc communication requests, indicating its importance in system performance."
