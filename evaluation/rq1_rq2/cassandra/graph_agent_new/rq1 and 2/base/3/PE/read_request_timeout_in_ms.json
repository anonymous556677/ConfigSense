    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'read_request_timeout_in_ms' is performance-sensitive. This classification is based on the fact that the configuration directly influences the timeout for read operations in the system, which can significantly impact system performance. The code context reveals that the configuration is used to set timeouts for read operations, which are crucial for system responsiveness. Therefore, any changes to this configuration can have notable performance implications at the system level."
