    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'file_cache_enabled' configuration is performance-sensitive. The configuration directly affects the system's performance by enabling or disabling the chunk cache based on the DatabaseDescriptor settings and cache size. The code snippet related to this configuration checks if the file cache is enabled and if the cache size is greater than 0 to determine whether to create an instance of ChunkCache. Enabling the chunk cache impacts memory usage by storing uncompressed buffers in-memory, which can significantly improve read performance by reducing disk I/O operations. Therefore, the configuration involves performance-related operations that are memory-expensive and lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
