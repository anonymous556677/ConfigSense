    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'allocate_tokens_for_local_replication_factor' is performance-sensitive. This classification is based on the fact that the configuration directly impacts the token allocation strategy for local replication factor, which in turn affects the distribution and replication of data within the cluster. The code context provided shows that the configuration involves allocating tokens based on different criteria such as initial tokens, allocation keyspace, and replication factor. These operations are time-expensive and memory-expensive, leading to notable performance variations at the system level. Additionally, the configuration is triggered frequently when generating bootstrap tokens for nodes joining the cluster, further emphasizing its performance sensitivity."
