    "Reason": "The configuration option is not performance-sensitive because it primarily deals with authentication and authorization operations, which are more focused on security and access control rather than performance optimizations. The code snippets related to the configuration involve validation and authorization logic, which are essential for ensuring proper access control but do not directly impact performance at the system level."
