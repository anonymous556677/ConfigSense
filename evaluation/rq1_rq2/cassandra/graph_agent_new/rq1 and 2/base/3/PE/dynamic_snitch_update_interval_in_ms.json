    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'dynamic_snitch_update_interval_in_ms' is performance-sensitive because it directly affects the frequency of updating the dynamic snitch configuration, which in turn impacts the host score calculation. The code context shows that the configuration controls the interval for updating the dynamic snitch configuration, which involves time-expensive operations such as canceling and rescheduling update and reset schedulers based on the configured rates. This can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, making it performance-sensitive."
