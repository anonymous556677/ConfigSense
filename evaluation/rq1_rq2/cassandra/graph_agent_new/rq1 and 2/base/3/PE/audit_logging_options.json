    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The audit_logging_options configuration is performance-sensitive. This is because enabling audit logging through this configuration involves logging every incoming CQL command request and authentication, which adds overhead to the system. The code snippets related to this configuration, such as creating the audit logger and enabling audit logging, involve operations that are time-expensive and memory-expensive. These operations can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, especially when audit logging is enabled with a high volume of requests. Therefore, the configuration directly and substantially affects system performance, making it performance-sensitive."
