    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'enable_transient_replication' configuration is classified as performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly impacts system performance by checking if transient replication is enabled in the cassandra.yaml file and throwing an exception if it is not enabled. The code context shows that enabling transient replication involves operations that contribute to execution time and memory consumption, such as checking for transient replicas and validating options. Additionally, the configuration allows for the creation of transiently replicated keyspaces, which can introduce additional complexity and potential issues in the system, leading to notable performance variations at the system level."
