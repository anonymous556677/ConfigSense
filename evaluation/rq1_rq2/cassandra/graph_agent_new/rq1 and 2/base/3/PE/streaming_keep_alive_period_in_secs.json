    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'streaming_keep_alive_period_in_secs' is performance-sensitive. This is because the value of this configuration directly affects the frequency of keep-alive messages sent between nodes to maintain stream sessions. The code context provided shows that this configuration is used to schedule keep-alive tasks at a fixed rate based on the specified period. A longer period may result in longer wait times before a stalled stream times out, impacting system performance. Additionally, the method getStreamingKeepAlivePeriod() directly retrieves the value of this configuration parameter, indicating its importance in determining system behavior."
