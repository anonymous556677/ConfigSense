    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'row_cache_size_in_mb' configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the memory allocation for the row cache in the system. The code snippets provided show that this configuration is used to set the capacity of the row cache, which can significantly affect the system's memory usage. Setting a higher value for this configuration can lead to increased memory consumption, potentially causing performance variations at the system level. Therefore, the configuration involves performance-related operations that are memory-expensive and can lead to notable performance variations, making it performance-sensitive."
