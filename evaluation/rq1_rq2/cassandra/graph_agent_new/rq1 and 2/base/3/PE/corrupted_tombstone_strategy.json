    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'corrupted_tombstone_strategy' is not performance-sensitive based on the provided code context and developer's information. The configuration is used to determine how tombstones are validated on reads and compaction, and it does not involve any performance-related operations that are time-extensive or memory-extensive within its related code. The configuration's impact is limited to handling invalid tombstones by logging a warning message or throwing an exception, which does not lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
