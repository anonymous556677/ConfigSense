    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'cross_node_timeout' configuration is performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly impacts the operation timeout information exchange between nodes, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The code snippet provided shows that the configuration check is done in the getExpiresAtNanos method, which is a time-expensive operation. Additionally, enabling this configuration ensures accurate measurement of request timeouts between nodes, which can significantly affect system performance. Therefore, the configuration is considered performance-sensitive based on its direct and substantial impact on system performance."
