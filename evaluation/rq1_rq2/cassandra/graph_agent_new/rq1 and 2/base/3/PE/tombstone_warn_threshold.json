    "Reason": "The 'tombstone_warn_threshold' configuration is not performance-sensitive. The configuration is used to adjust the warning threshold for tombstones in the system, which does not directly and substantially affect system performance at the system level. The configuration-related code context does not involve any performance-sensitive operations that contribute significantly to execution time or memory consumption."
