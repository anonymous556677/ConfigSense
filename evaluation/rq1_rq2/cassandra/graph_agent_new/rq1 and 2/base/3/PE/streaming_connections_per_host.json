    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'streaming_connections_per_host' configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the number of connections per host for streaming. This configuration affects the system performance by potentially reducing the CPU-bound nature of joins during streaming large files, leading to notable performance variations at the system level. The code context shows that this configuration is used in critical operations like bootstrap and rebuild, which are essential for the system's functionality and can have a significant impact on performance."
