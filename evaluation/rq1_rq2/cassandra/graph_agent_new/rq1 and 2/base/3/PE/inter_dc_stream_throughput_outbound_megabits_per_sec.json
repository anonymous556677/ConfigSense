    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'inter_dc_stream_throughput_outbound_megabits_per_sec' is classified as performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly impacts the throttling of all streaming file transfer between datacenters, which can significantly affect the overall data transfer speed at the system level. The code context provided includes methods like 'calculateInterDCRateInBytes' which perform time-expensive operations based on the configuration value, further indicating the performance sensitivity of the configuration. Therefore, the configuration involves performance-related operations that are time-extensive and memory-expensive, leading to notable performance variations at the system level."
