    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'internode_application_send_queue_reserve_global_capacity_in_bytes' is classified as performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly impacts the amount of memory allocated for queuing messages for delivery and processing within the cluster. Setting a higher value for this configuration can lead to increased memory consumption, which can have a notable performance impact at the system level. Additionally, the code context provided shows that this configuration is related to scheduling unused connection monitoring, which can be a time-expensive operation. Therefore, the combination of memory-intensive operations and potentially time-expensive operations makes this configuration performance-sensitive."
