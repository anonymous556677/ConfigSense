    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'stream_entire_sstables' configuration is performance-sensitive. The code context provided indicates that enabling this configuration allows Cassandra to zero-copy stream entire eligible SSTables between nodes, which can significantly speed up network transfers and reduce GC pressure. This directly impacts system performance at the network level by improving transfer speeds and reducing resource consumption. Additionally, the configuration involves time-extensive and memory-extensive operations related to streaming SSTables, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
