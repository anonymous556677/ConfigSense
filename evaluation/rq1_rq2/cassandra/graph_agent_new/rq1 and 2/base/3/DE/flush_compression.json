As high ratio compressors like LZ4HC, Zstd, and Deflate can potentially block flushes for too long, the default is to flush with a known fast compressor in those cases. Options are:  none : Flush without compressing blocks but while still doing checksums. fast : Flush with a fast compressor. If the table is already using a fast compressor that compressor is used. table: Always flush with the same compressor that the table uses. This was the pre 4.0 behavior. ",

The code checks the operation type, and if it is a flush operation, it looks at the 'DatabaseDescriptor.getFlushCompression()' value to decide which compression algorithm to use.",

Choosing a high ratio compressor like LZ4HC, Zstd, or Deflate can potentially block flushes for too long, so the default behavior is to use a fast compressor in those cases to prevent blocking flushes."
