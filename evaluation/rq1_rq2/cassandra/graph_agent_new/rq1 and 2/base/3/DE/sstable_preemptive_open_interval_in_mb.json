    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The triggering frequency of the 'sstable_preemptive_open_interval_in_mb' configuration depends on the compaction process and the frequency of sstable replacements during compaction.

By opening replacement sstables early, the system can improve read performance and reduce the impact of compaction on overall system performance."
