    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The configuration 'hints_flush_period_in_ms' is used to determine how often hints should be flushed from the internal buffers to disk. This configuration is set in milliseconds and is used to schedule a periodic task that flushes the buffers.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The configuration is triggered in the system by scheduling a task using ScheduledExecutors.scheduleWithFixedDelay method. The task is triggered at the specified flush period interval, which is set by the 'hints_flush_period_in_ms' configuration.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the 'hints_flush_period_in_ms' configuration option is that it determines how frequently the internal buffers are flushed to disk. A shorter flush period may result in more frequent disk writes, potentially impacting disk I/O performance. On the other hand, a longer flush period may lead to increased memory usage as data accumulates in the buffers before being flushed."
