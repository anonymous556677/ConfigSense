    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The triggering frequency of the 'memtable_offheap_space_in_mb' configuration depends on the memtable_cleanup_threshold set in the DatabaseDescriptor. When the memtable size exceeds the cleanup threshold, a flush will be triggered, which in turn will use the off-heap space limit set by 'memtable_offheap_space_in_mb'. The frequency of triggering the configuration can vary based on the workload and data being written to the system.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the 'memtable_offheap_space_in_mb' configuration option on the system is significant as it directly affects the amount of off-heap memory allocated for memtables. Setting this configuration too low may result in frequent flushes and potentially performance degradation, while setting it too high may lead to excessive memory usage and potential out-of-memory errors. It is important to carefully tune this configuration based on the system's workload and available resources."
