When the maybeIncrementallyBackup method is called, it first checks if incremental backups are enabled using the isIncrementalBackupsEnabled method. If enabled, it creates hard links to each SSTable flushed or streamed locally in a backups/ subdirectory of the keyspace data.",

However, it provides a way to backup data incrementally without duplicating the entire SSTable, which can be beneficial for data protection and recovery."
