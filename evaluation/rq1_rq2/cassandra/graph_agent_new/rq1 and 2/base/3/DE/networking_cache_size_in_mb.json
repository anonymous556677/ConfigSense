    "config_description": "Maximum memory to use for inter-node and client-server networking buffers.  Defaults to the smaller of 1/16 of heap or 128MB. This pool is allocated off-heap, so is in addition to the memory allocated for heap. The cache also has on-heap overhead which is roughly 128 bytes per chunk (i.e. 0.2% of the reserved size if the default 64k chunk size is used). Memory is only allocated when needed.",
    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The configuration 'networking_cache_size_in_mb' is used to determine the maximum memory to use for inter-node and client-server networking buffers. It is allocated off-heap and is in addition to the memory allocated for heap. Memory is only allocated when needed.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The configuration is triggered when the BufferPools class is loaded by the JVM, which typically happens once during the application startup.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the 'networking_cache_size_in_mb' configuration option is that it determines the maximum memory available for networking buffers, which can affect the performance and resource usage of the system. Setting it too low may lead to memory allocation failures, while setting it too high may result in excessive memory usage."
