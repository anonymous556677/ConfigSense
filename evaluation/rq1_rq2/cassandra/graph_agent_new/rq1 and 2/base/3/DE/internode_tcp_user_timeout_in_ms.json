If you want something that high set this to 0 which picks up the OS default and configure the net.ipv4.tcp_retries2 sysctl to be ~8.",
    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The configuration option 'internode_tcp_user_timeout_in_ms' is used to determine the amount of time to wait for internode TCP connections to establish in Cassandra. The code snippet provided shows that the method 'tcpUserTimeoutInMS' is used to return the value of this configuration option based on the connection category provided. If a specific value is not set, it falls back to using the values from 'DatabaseDescriptor.getInternodeTcpUserTimeoutInMS()' or 'DatabaseDescriptor.getInternodeStreamingTcpUserTimeoutInMS()' depending on the connection category.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The triggering frequency of the 'internode_tcp_user_timeout_in_ms' configuration in the system depends on the frequency of establishing internode TCP connections in Cassandra. This configuration is triggered whenever a new internode TCP connection is being established.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the 'internode_tcp_user_timeout_in_ms' configuration option on the system is significant as it determines the amount of time allowed for internode TCP connections to establish. Setting this value too low may result in connection timeouts, while setting it too high may lead to increased connection establishment times. It is important to configure this value appropriately based on the network conditions and requirements of the Cassandra cluster."
