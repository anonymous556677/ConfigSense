    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The configuration 'batch_size_fail_threshold_in_kb' is used to determine the threshold at which a multiple-partition batch will fail. It is retrieved by calling the method getBatchSizeFailureThreshold() which in turn calls DatabaseDescriptor.getBatchSizeFailThresholdInKB().",

It will be triggered whenever a multiple-partition batch exceeds the specified threshold value.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the configuration option 'batch_size_fail_threshold_in_kb' on the system is that it helps in preventing large multiple-partition batches from causing issues or failures. By setting an appropriate threshold, the system can avoid processing batches that are too large and potentially problematic."
