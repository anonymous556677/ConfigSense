    "config_description": "Global, per-endpoint and per-connection limits imposed on messages queued for delivery to other nodes and waiting to be processed on arrival from other nodes in the cluster.  These limits are applied to the on-wire size of the message being sent or received.  The basic per-link limit is consumed in isolation before any endpoint or global limit is imposed. Each node-pair has three links: urgent, small and large.  So any given node may have a maximum of N*3*(internode_application_send_queue_capacity_in_bytes+internode_application_receive_queue_capacity_in_bytes) messages queued without any coordination between them although in practice, with token-aware routing, only RF*tokens nodes should need to communicate with significant bandwidth.  The per-endpoint limit is imposed on all messages exceeding the per-link limit, simultaneously with the global limit, on all links to or from a single node in the cluster. The global limit is imposed on all messages exceeding the per-link limit, simultaneously with the per-endpoint limit, on all links to or from any node in the cluster.  internode_application_send_queue_capacity_in_bytes: 4194304                       #4MiB internode_application_send_queue_reserve_endpoint_capacity_in_bytes: 134217728    #128MiB internode_application_send_queue_reserve_global_capacity_in_bytes: 536870912      #512MiB internode_application_receive_queue_capacity_in_bytes: 4194304                    #4MiB internode_application_receive_queue_reserve_endpoint_capacity_in_bytes: 134217728 #128MiB",
    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The configuration 'internode_application_receive_queue_reserve_global_capacity_in_bytes' sets the global limit on the size of messages queued for delivery to other nodes and waiting to be processed on arrival from other nodes in the cluster. This limit is applied to the on-wire size of the message being sent or received.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The configuration is triggered whenever a message is queued for delivery to other nodes or when a message is waiting to be processed on arrival from other nodes. The frequency of triggering depends on the message traffic between nodes in the cluster.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the 'internode_application_receive_queue_reserve_global_capacity_in_bytes' configuration option is significant as it determines the maximum size of messages that can be queued for delivery or processing. Setting this limit too low may result in message loss or delays in message processing, while setting it too high may consume excessive system resources and lead to performance issues."
