    "config_description": "Throttles all streaming file transfer between the datacenters, this setting allows users to throttle inter dc stream throughput in addition to throttling all network stream traffic as configured with stream_throughput_outbound_megabits_per_sec When unset, the default is 200 Mbps or 25 MB/s",
    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The configuration 'inter_dc_stream_throughput_outbound_megabits_per_sec' is used to throttle all streaming file transfer between the datacenters. It allows users to throttle inter dc stream throughput in addition to throttling all network stream traffic as configured with 'stream_throughput_outbound_megabits_per_sec'. The configuration value is set and retrieved using the provided setter and getter methods.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The triggering frequency of the configuration depends on when the 'setInterDCStreamThroughputMbPerSec' method is called with a new value. This method is called whenever there is a need to update the inter DC stream throughput setting.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the configuration option is significant as it directly affects the throughput of streaming file transfers between datacenters. By setting a lower value, users can limit the inter DC stream throughput, which can help in managing network resources and preventing overload. Setting a higher value can increase the throughput but may also lead to resource contention and potential performance issues."
