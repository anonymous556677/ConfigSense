If space gets above this value, Cassandra will throw WriteTimeoutException on Mutations including tables with CDC enabled. A CDCCompactor is responsible for parsing the raw CDC logs and deleting them when parsing is completed.  The default value is the min of 4096 mb and 1/8th of the total space of the drive where cdc_raw_directory resides.",

It retrieves the value set for CDCSpaceInMB in the DatabaseDescriptor and converts it to bytes by multiplying with 1024 * 1024.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The triggering frequency of the 'cdc_total_space_in_mb' configuration depends on the usage of change-data-capture logs and the rate at which data is being written to the system. If the space allocated for CDC logs exceeds the configured value, Cassandra will throw WriteTimeoutException on Mutations with CDC enabled tables.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the 'cdc_total_space_in_mb' configuration option is significant as it directly affects the availability of space for CDC logs. If the allocated space is insufficient, it can lead to WriteTimeoutExceptions and potentially disrupt the system's ability to capture and process change data effectively."
