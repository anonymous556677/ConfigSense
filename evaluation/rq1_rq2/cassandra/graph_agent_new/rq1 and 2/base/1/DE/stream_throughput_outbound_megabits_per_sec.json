    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The configuration 'stream_throughput_outbound_megabits_per_sec' is used to throttle all streaming file transfer between datacenters. The code snippet provided shows that the configuration value is set and retrieved using DatabaseDescriptor methods. The 'calculateRateInBytes' method calculates the rate in bytes based on the configured throughput value.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The triggering frequency of the configuration depends on when the 'setStreamThroughputMbPerSec' method is called to update the value. The frequency can vary based on how often this method is invoked in the system.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the 'stream_throughput_outbound_megabits_per_sec' configuration option is significant as it directly affects the throughput of streaming file transfers between datacenters. Setting a lower value can limit the throughput, while setting a higher value can increase the throughput. It is important to consider the network bandwidth and system resources when configuring this option."
