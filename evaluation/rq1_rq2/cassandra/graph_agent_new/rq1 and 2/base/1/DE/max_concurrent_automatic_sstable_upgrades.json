    "config_description": "Automatically upgrade sstables after upgrade - if there is no ordinary compaction to do, the oldest non-upgraded sstable will get upgraded to the latest version automatic_sstable_upgrade: false Limit the number of concurrent sstable upgrades",
    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The configuration 'max_concurrent_automatic_sstable_upgrades' controls the maximum number of concurrent sstable upgrade tasks that can be run automatically. The code snippet shows that the configuration is used to limit the number of upgrade tasks that can be executed concurrently.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The configuration is triggered whenever the 'maybeRunUpgradeTask' method is called, which is likely to be triggered whenever there is a need to check for and execute upgrade tasks. The triggering frequency depends on the workload and compaction strategy of the system.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the 'max_concurrent_automatic_sstable_upgrades' configuration option is that it can control the resource usage and concurrency level of sstable upgrade tasks in the system. Setting a higher value may increase the system's ability to upgrade sstables quickly but may also consume more resources. Conversely, setting a lower value may reduce resource usage but may slow down the upgrade process."
