    "config_description": "Total permitted memory to use for memtables. Cassandra will stop accepting writes when the limit is exceeded until a flush completes, and will trigger a flush based on memtable_cleanup_threshold If omitted, Cassandra will set both to 1/4 the size of the heap.",
    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The configuration 'memtable_heap_space_in_mb' is used to set the total permitted memory to use for memtables in the system. The code snippet provided shows that the value of this configuration is retrieved using DatabaseDescriptor.getMemtableHeapSpaceInMb() and then converted to bytes by shifting left by 20 bits. This value is then used to allocate memory for different types of memtable pools based on the allocation type specified in DatabaseDescriptor.getMemtableAllocationType().",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The triggering frequency of the 'memtable_heap_space_in_mb' configuration is based on the memtable_cleanup_threshold. When the total memory used for memtables exceeds the limit set by 'memtable_heap_space_in_mb', Cassandra will stop accepting writes until a flush completes. The flush will be triggered based on the memtable_cleanup_threshold value.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the 'memtable_heap_space_in_mb' configuration option on the system is significant. If the limit set by this configuration is too low, Cassandra may stop accepting writes frequently, leading to performance degradation. On the other hand, setting a very high limit may result in excessive memory usage and potential out-of-memory errors. It is crucial to set this configuration appropriately to balance performance and memory usage in the system."
