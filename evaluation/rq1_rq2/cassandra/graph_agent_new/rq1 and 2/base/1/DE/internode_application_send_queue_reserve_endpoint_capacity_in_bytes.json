    "config_description": "Global, per-endpoint and per-connection limits imposed on messages queued for delivery to other nodes and waiting to be processed on arrival from other nodes in the cluster.  These limits are applied to the on-wire size of the message being sent or received.  The basic per-link limit is consumed in isolation before any endpoint or global limit is imposed. Each node-pair has three links: urgent, small and large.  So any given node may have a maximum of N*3*(internode_application_send_queue_capacity_in_bytes+internode_application_receive_queue_capacity_in_bytes) messages queued without any coordination between them although in practice, with token-aware routing, only RF*tokens nodes should need to communicate with significant bandwidth.  The per-endpoint limit is imposed on all messages exceeding the per-link limit, simultaneously with the global limit, on all links to or from a single node in the cluster. The global limit is imposed on all messages exceeding the per-link limit, simultaneously with the per-endpoint limit, on all links to or from any node in the cluster.  internode_application_send_queue_capacity_in_bytes: 4194304                       #4MiB",

It retrieves the values for applicationReserveSendQueueEndpointCapacityInBytes and applicationReserveSendQueueGlobalCapacityInBytes, and if they are null, it assigns them values from DatabaseDescriptor and MessagingService respectively. Finally, it returns the updated settings with the applicationReserveSendQueueCapacityInBytes.",

    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The configuration option internode_application_send_queue_reserve_endpoint_capacity_in_bytes sets the limit on the on-wire size of messages queued for delivery to other nodes and waiting to be processed on arrival from other nodes. This limit affects the amount of memory allocated for message queues and can impact the overall system performance and resource utilization. Exceeding this limit may lead to message drops or delays in message processing."
