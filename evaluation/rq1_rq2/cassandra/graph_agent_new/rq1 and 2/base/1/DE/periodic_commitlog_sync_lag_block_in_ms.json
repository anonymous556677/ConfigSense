    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The configuration 'periodic_commitlog_sync_lag_block_in_ms' is used in the code to determine the number of milliseconds to block writes while waiting for a slow disk flush to complete in periodic commitlog mode. It calculates the expected sync time based on the current time and the configured block time.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The triggering frequency of the 'periodic_commitlog_sync_lag_block_in_ms' configuration depends on the frequency of disk flushes and the lag in sync operations. It is triggered whenever a slow disk flush is detected and the system needs to wait for it to complete.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the 'periodic_commitlog_sync_lag_block_in_ms' configuration option on the system is that it can potentially block write operations for a certain amount of time, affecting the overall write performance of the system. If the configured block time is too long, it may lead to increased latency in write operations."
