    "config_description": "The act of creating or clearing a snapshot involves creating or removing potentially tens of thousands of links, which can cause significant performance impact, especially on consumer grade SSDs. A non-zero value here can be used to throttle these links to avoid negative performance impact of taking and clearing snapshots",
    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The configuration 'snapshot_links_per_second' is used to throttle the creation or clearing of snapshot links to avoid negative performance impact. The getSnapshotLinksPerSecond method retrieves the value of 'snapshot_links_per_second' from DatabaseDescriptor and passes it to RateLimiter.create to create a rate limiter for controlling the snapshot link creation or clearing rate.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The triggering frequency of the 'snapshot_links_per_second' configuration depends on the frequency of creating or clearing snapshots in the system. The configuration is triggered whenever a snapshot operation is performed, and the rate limiter controls the rate at which these operations can be executed.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the 'snapshot_links_per_second' configuration is significant in terms of performance optimization. By setting a non-zero value for this configuration, the system can throttle the snapshot link creation or clearing process to avoid overloading the system, especially on consumer grade SSDs. This helps in maintaining system performance and preventing negative impacts caused by excessive snapshot operations."
