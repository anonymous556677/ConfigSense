This means that only partition information is held on heap and the index entries are read from disk.  Note that this size refers to the size of the serialized index information and not the size of the partition.",
    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The configuration 'column_index_cache_size_in_kb' determines the size limit for sstable indexed key cache entries. Entries exceeding this size will not be held on heap, meaning only partition information is held on heap and index entries are read from disk.",

    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the 'column_index_cache_size_in_kb' configuration option is that it affects the amount of memory used for holding index entries in memory. Setting a higher value may improve performance by keeping more index entries in memory, while setting a lower value may result in more disk reads for index entries."
