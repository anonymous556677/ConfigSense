    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The configuration 'batch_size_fail_threshold_in_kb' is used to determine the threshold at which a multiple-partition batch will fail. It is retrieved using the method getBatchSizeFailureThreshold() which internally calls DatabaseDescriptor.getBatchSizeFailThresholdInKB().",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The triggering frequency of the 'batch_size_fail_threshold_in_kb' configuration depends on the batch size of the multiple-partition batches being processed. If a batch exceeds the configured threshold, it will trigger the failure condition.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the 'batch_size_fail_threshold_in_kb' configuration option is that it helps in preventing large multiple-partition batches from causing issues in the system. By setting an appropriate threshold, the system can avoid processing batches that are too large and potentially harmful."
