    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The triggering frequency of the 'internode_socket_send_buffer_size_in_bytes' configuration depends on when the socket buffer size needs to be set for internode communication. It is triggered when the application initializes or when the configuration is changed during runtime.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the 'internode_socket_send_buffer_size_in_bytes' configuration option is that it allows for setting the socket buffer size for internode communication. Setting a larger buffer size can potentially improve network performance by allowing for more data to be buffered before transmission, but it may also consume more system resources. It is important to consider the system's network and memory capabilities when configuring this option."
