    "config_description": "Maximum size of the counter cache in memory.  Counter cache helps to reduce counter locks' contention for hot counter cells. In case of RF = 1 a counter cache hit will cause Cassandra to skip the read before write entirely. With RF > 1 a counter cache hit will still help to reduce the duration of the lock hold, helping with hot counter cell updates, but will not allow skipping the read entirely. Only the local (clock, count) tuple of a counter cell is kept in memory, not the whole counter, so it's relatively cheap.  NOTE: if you reduce the size, you may not get you hottest keys loaded on startup.  Default value is empty to make it \"auto\" (min(2.5% of Heap (in MB), 50MB)). Set to 0 to disable counter cache. NOTE: if you perform counter deletes and rely on low gcgs, you should disable the counter cache.",

Setting a higher value can help improve performance by reducing contention for hot counter cells, while setting a lower value may result in not loading the hottest keys on startup. Disabling the counter cache by setting the value to 0 may be necessary if counter deletes are performed and low gcgs are relied upon."
