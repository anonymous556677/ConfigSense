    "config_description": "Controls when idle client connections are closed. Idle connections are ones that had neither reads nor writes for a time period.  Clients may implement heartbeats by sending OPTIONS native protocol message after a timeout, which will reset idle timeout timer on the server side. To close idle client connections, corresponding values for heartbeat intervals have to be set on the client side.  Idle connection timeouts are disabled by default.",
    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The configuration 'native_transport_idle_timeout_in_ms' controls when idle client connections are closed in the code. Idle connections are those that had neither reads nor writes for a specified time period. The configuration sets an idle timeout for client connections, and if a connection remains idle for longer than the specified timeout, it will be closed.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The triggering frequency of the 'native_transport_idle_timeout_in_ms' configuration depends on the activity of client connections. If clients do not send any reads or writes within the specified idle timeout period, the configuration will be triggered to close the idle connections.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the 'native_transport_idle_timeout_in_ms' configuration option on the system is that it helps manage and free up resources by closing idle client connections. This can prevent resource wastage and improve the overall performance and efficiency of the system."
