    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The configuration 'max_hint_window_in_ms' is used to define the maximum amount of time a dead host will have hints generated. This value is used in the shouldHint method to check if the hint window for a dead host has expired.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The triggering frequency of the 'max_hint_window_in_ms' configuration depends on the downtime of the hosts in the system. The shouldHint method checks if the hint window for a dead host has expired based on this configuration.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the 'max_hint_window_in_ms' configuration option is that it determines how long hints will be generated for a dead host. Setting this value too high may result in unnecessary hint generation for hosts that have been dead for a long time, impacting system performance. On the other hand, setting it too low may result in hints not being generated for hosts that are temporarily down."
