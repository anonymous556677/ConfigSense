Options are:  none : Flush without compressing blocks but while still doing checksums. fast : Flush with a fast compressor. If the table is already using a fast compressor that compressor is used. table: Always flush with the same compressor that the table uses. This was the pre 4.0 behavior. ",

Using high ratio compressors like LZ4HC, Zstd, and Deflate can potentially block flushes for too long, so the default behavior is to use a fast compressor in those cases to avoid blocking writes."
