    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The rpc_keepalive configuration option in the code is used to enable or disable keepalive on rpc/native connections. It is set in the Server constructor by calling DatabaseDescriptor.getRpcKeepAlive(). The value of this configuration option is used in the PipelineConfigurator constructor to determine whether keepalive should be enabled or disabled on connections.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The triggering frequency of the rpc_keepalive configuration in the system depends on when the Server constructor is called to create a new server instance. Typically, this configuration is set when the server is initialized or started.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the rpc_keepalive configuration option on the system is related to the performance and resource usage of the server. Enabling keepalive on connections can help improve efficiency by reducing the overhead of establishing new connections. However, it may also consume more resources as connections are kept alive for longer periods."
