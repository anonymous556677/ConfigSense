However, it is not clear how 'conf' is related to the actual configuration of the system. The configuration related code provided in the description shows that the actual method to check if incremental backups are enabled is 'DatabaseDescriptor.isIncrementalBackupsEnabled()', which in turn calls 'DatabaseDescriptor.isIncrementalBackupsEnabled()'. This suggests that 'conf' may be a configuration object that holds the incremental_backups setting, but the relationship between 'conf' and the actual system configuration is not clear."
