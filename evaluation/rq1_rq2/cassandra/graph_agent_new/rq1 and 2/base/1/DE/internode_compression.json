    "config_description": "internode_compression controls whether traffic between nodes is compressed. Can be:  all all traffic is compressed  dc traffic between different datacenters is compressed  none nothing is compressed.",
    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The configuration 'internode_compression' is used in the shouldCompressConnection method to determine whether the connection between nodes should be compressed. It checks if the internodeCompression setting in DatabaseDescriptor is set to 'all' or 'dc' and if the connection is not within the same datacenter.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The triggering frequency of the 'internode_compression' configuration depends on the traffic between nodes and the setting chosen. If the setting is 'all', all traffic between nodes will be compressed. If the setting is 'dc', only traffic between different datacenters will be compressed.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the 'internode_compression' configuration option on the system is in terms of network bandwidth and CPU usage. If 'all' is chosen, it can reduce network bandwidth usage but increase CPU usage due to compression and decompression. If 'dc' is chosen, it can reduce network bandwidth usage for inter-datacenter traffic only."
