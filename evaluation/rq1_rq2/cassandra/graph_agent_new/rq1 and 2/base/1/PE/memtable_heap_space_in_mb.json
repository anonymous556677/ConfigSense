    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'memtable_heap_space_in_mb' is performance-sensitive. The code snippet provided shows that this configuration directly affects the allocation of memory for memtables in the system, which can have a significant impact on system performance. Setting a low limit may lead to frequent flushes and performance degradation, while setting a high limit may result in excessive memory usage and potential out-of-memory errors. The configuration involves time-expensive operations such as memory allocation based on the value retrieved from the configuration, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
