    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'native_transport_max_frame_size_in_mb' configuration option is performance-sensitive. This classification is based on the fact that the configuration directly impacts the maximum size of frames that can be processed by the system. If the configured maximum frame size is too small, it can lead to the rejection of larger frames, affecting system performance. Additionally, the code context shows that the configuration is used in methods like 'extractHeader' which involve decoding and processing frames, indicating that changes to this configuration can have notable performance variations at the system level."
