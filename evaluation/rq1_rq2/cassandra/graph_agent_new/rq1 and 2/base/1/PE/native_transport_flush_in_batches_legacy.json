    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'native_transport_flush_in_batches_legacy' is classified as performance-sensitive. This is because enabling this configuration directly affects the throughput performance at the system level by enabling native transport TCP message coalescing. The code context reveals that this configuration is used during the initialization of the Server class to set up the pipelineConfigurator with the value from DatabaseDescriptor.useNativeTransportLegacyFlusher(). This indicates that the configuration involves performance-related operations that are time-extensive and can lead to notable performance variations, making it performance-sensitive."
