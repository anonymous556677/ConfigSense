    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'transparent_data_encryption_options' is performance-sensitive. The configuration involves encryption and decryption operations that are time-expensive and memory-expensive. These operations directly impact system performance at the system level by increasing CPU and disk usage. The configuration-related code includes methods like 'createEncryption' that handle encryption operations, which contribute to notable performance variations. Additionally, the configuration is triggered whenever data needs to be encrypted at-rest, which can lead to significant performance impacts depending on the frequency of write operations that require encryption."
