    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'internode_socket_send_buffer_size_in_bytes' is classified as performance-sensitive. This classification is based on the fact that setting the socket buffer size for internode communication can directly impact system performance at the network level. The code snippet provided indicates that the configuration is used to determine the socket buffer size, which can have a significant impact on network performance by affecting data transmission efficiency. Additionally, the configuration involves retrieving the buffer size from a configuration object, indicating its direct relation to system performance. Therefore, the configuration is considered performance-sensitive due to its potential to cause notable performance variations at the system level."
