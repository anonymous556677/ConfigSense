    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'keyspace_count_warn_threshold' configuration is performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly impacts system performance by setting a threshold for the number of keyspaces in the cluster. If the actual number of keyspaces exceeds this threshold, a warning message is logged and added to the client warnings set, indicating that having a large number of keyspaces will significantly slow down schema-dependent cluster operations. This configuration involves performance-related operations that are time-expensive (checking keyspace count) and memory-expensive (logging and adding warning messages), leading to notable performance variations at the system level."
