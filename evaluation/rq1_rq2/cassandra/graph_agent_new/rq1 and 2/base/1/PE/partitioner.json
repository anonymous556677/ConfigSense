    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'partitioner' configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly affects system performance at the system level by handling partitioning logic, persisting local metadata, and managing system replicas. The configuration involves operations that contribute to execution time and memory consumption, such as adding rows to SSTables and accessing system replicas. Changing the partitioner can have a significant impact on data distribution and performance, making it a performance-sensitive configuration."
