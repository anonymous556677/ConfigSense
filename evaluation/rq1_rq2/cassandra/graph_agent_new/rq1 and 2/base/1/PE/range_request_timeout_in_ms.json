    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'range_request_timeout_in_ms' configuration is classified as performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly affects the system's performance at the system level by determining how long the coordinator should wait for sequential or index scans to complete. The configuration involves performance-related operations such as fetching the configured timeout value in milliseconds in methods like 'getTimeout' and 'getRangeRpcTimeout'. These operations contribute significantly to execution time and memory consumption, leading to notable performance variations at the system level."
