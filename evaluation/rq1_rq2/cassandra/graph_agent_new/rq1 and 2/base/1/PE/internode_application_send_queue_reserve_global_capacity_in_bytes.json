    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'internode_application_send_queue_reserve_global_capacity_in_bytes' is performance-sensitive. This is because it directly impacts the maximum number of messages that can be queued for delivery between nodes in the cluster, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The code context provided also suggests that this configuration is related to monitoring and managing outbound connections, which are time-expensive operations that can significantly affect system performance."
