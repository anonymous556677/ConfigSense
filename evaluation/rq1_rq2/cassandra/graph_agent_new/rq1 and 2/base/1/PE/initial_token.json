{
    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'initial_token' configuration option is classified as performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the configuration directly impacts the token assignment for nodes in the cluster, which can affect the distribution of data, performance, and load balancing of the system. The code context provided shows that the configuration involves time-expensive operations such as generating suitable tokens based on manual input or using an allocation algorithm. These operations can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, making the 'initial_token' configuration performance-sensitive."
