{
    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'inter_dc_tcp_nodelay' is classified as performance-sensitive. The code context shows that the configuration directly impacts the tcp_nodelay setting for inter-dc communication, which can significantly affect network performance. Enabling or disabling tcp_nodelay affects the size of network packets being sent, potentially increasing latency for cross-datacenter responses. The triggering frequency of this configuration depends on the frequency of inter-dc communication requests, indicating that it can have notable performance variations at the system level."
