    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'enable_transient_replication' is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts system performance at the system level. The code context shows that enabling transient replication triggers certain actions based on this configuration, which can lead to notable performance variations. Enabling transient replication introduces experimental features that may impact system performance and stability, affecting replication strategy and options validation. Additionally, the validation methods 'validateReplicationStrategy' and 'validate' are called in the system, indicating that this configuration is involved in performance-related operations that are time-expensive and memory-expensive."
