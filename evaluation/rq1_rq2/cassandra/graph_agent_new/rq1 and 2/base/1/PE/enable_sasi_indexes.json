    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The 'enable_sasi_indexes' configuration option is not performance-sensitive based on the provided code context and developer information. The configuration is primarily used to check if SASI indexes are enabled in the Cassandra database. Enabling SASI indexes through this configuration does not involve any performance-intensive operations or notable performance variations at the system level. The code snippet related to this configuration focuses on schema validation and index creation/update logic, which does not directly impact system performance in a significant way."
