    "classification_result": "Performance-insensitive with 100% confidence",
    "Reason": "The configuration option for the maximum number of concurrent client connections is performance-insensitive because it only determines the limit of client connections and does not directly impact system performance. Different numbers of client connections do not affect the overall performance of the system."
