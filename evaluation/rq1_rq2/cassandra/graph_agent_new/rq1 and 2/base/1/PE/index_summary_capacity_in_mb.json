{
    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'index_summary_capacity_in_mb' is classified as performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the configuration directly impacts the memory pool size for SSTable index summaries, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The code context shows that the configuration is used to set the memory pool capacity, which is a memory-expensive operation. Additionally, the developer's information indicates that in extreme conditions, Cassandra may need to use more memory than the specified limit, further emphasizing the performance impact of this configuration."
