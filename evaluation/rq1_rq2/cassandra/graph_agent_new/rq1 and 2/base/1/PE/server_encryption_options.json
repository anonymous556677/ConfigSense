    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'server_encryption_options' configuration is performance-sensitive. The configuration directly impacts system performance by setting up SSL contexts, creating SSL connections, and performing checks on SSL certificates. These operations are time-expensive and memory-intensive, leading to notable performance variations at the system level. The configuration involves encryption options that replace default settings, affecting the performance of SSL connections and resource consumption. Therefore, it meets the criteria of being performance-sensitive based on the code context and developer's understanding."
