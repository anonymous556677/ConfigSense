    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'num_tokens' configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the distribution of data across nodes in the cluster, affecting system performance at the system level. The code related to this configuration involves operations that determine the token allocation algorithm, generate suitable tokens, and validate replication factors, all of which are time-expensive and memory-expensive operations contributing to notable performance variations. The configuration directly affects the efficiency and balance of data distribution, making it critical for system performance."
