    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'cas_contention_timeout_in_ms' is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the configuration directly impacts the performance and latency of CAS operations at the system level. The code context shows that the timeout value is crucial for determining how long a coordinator should retry CAS operations that contend with other proposals. The configuration is used as the timeout for retrying Paxos rounds, which are essential for ensuring consistency in the system. The timeout value directly affects the frequency of retries and the handling of contention scenarios, making it a critical factor in the performance of CAS operations."
