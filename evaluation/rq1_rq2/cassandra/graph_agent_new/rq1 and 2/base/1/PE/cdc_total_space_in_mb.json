    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'cdc_total_space_in_mb' configuration is performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly impacts the availability of space for change-data-capture logs on disk, which is crucial for the system's functionality. The code snippet provided shows that the configuration value is multiplied by 1024 * 1024 to convert it to bytes, indicating that it involves time-expensive operations. Insufficient space allocation can lead to WriteTimeoutExceptions, causing notable performance variations at the system level. Therefore, the configuration is considered performance-sensitive."
