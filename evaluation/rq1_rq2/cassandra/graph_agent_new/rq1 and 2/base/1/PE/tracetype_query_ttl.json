    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The 'tracetype_query_ttl' configuration option is not performance-sensitive based on the provided code context and developer information. The configuration is used to determine the TTL for different trace types during the logging of the repair process. It does not involve any performance-related operations that significantly impact system performance at the system level. The configuration is more focused on storage space impact for maintaining trace session data rather than causing notable performance variations."
