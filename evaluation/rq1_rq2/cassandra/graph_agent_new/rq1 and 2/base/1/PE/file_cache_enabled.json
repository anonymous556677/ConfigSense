    "Reason": "The 'file_cache_enabled' configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly affects the system's performance at the system level. The configuration involves checking if the flag is set to true and if the cache size is greater than 0 to enable the ChunkCache instance, which stores recently accessed sections of sstables in-memory. This operation contributes positively to execution time and memory consumption, leading to notable performance variations at the system level."
