    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'native_transport_max_concurrent_connections_per_ip' is performance-sensitive. This is because the code related to this configuration involves checking the number of connections per IP and closing the connection if it exceeds the configured limit. This operation directly impacts system performance by controlling the number of concurrent client connections per source IP address, which can have a notable performance variation at the system level. The configuration-related code contains time-expensive operations that contribute to execution time, making it performance-sensitive."
