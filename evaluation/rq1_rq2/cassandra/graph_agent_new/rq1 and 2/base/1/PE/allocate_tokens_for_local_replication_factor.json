    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'allocate_tokens_for_local_replication_factor' configuration is considered performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly impacts how bootstrap tokens are allocated for local replication factor, which in turn affects the distribution and replication of data within the system. The code context shows that the configuration involves operations that determine token allocation based on specified initial tokens, allocationKeyspace, and num_tokens. These operations can be time-expensive and memory-expensive, leading to notable performance variations at the system level during the bootstrap process."
