    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'sstable_preemptive_open_interval_in_mb' is performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly impacts the interval at which replacement sstables can be opened before they are completely written during compaction. This operation is time-expensive and memory-expensive as it involves optimizing the compaction process to improve read performance and reduce page cache churn at the system level. The code context shows that the configuration is used in the method calculateOpenInterval, which calculates the interval based on the configuration value. Therefore, the configuration involves performance-related operations that lead to notable performance variations, making it performance-sensitive."
