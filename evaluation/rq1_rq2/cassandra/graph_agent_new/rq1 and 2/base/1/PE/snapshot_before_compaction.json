    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'snapshot_before_compaction' is classified as performance-sensitive. This is because enabling this configuration directly impacts the system performance at the system level by taking a snapshot before each compaction process. The code related to this configuration involves time-expensive and memory-expensive operations such as taking snapshots, building compaction candidates, and managing compaction tasks. These operations contribute significantly to the execution time and memory consumption of the system, leading to notable performance variations. Additionally, the configuration's impact on storage space usage further emphasizes its performance sensitivity, as it can result in increased storage consumption due to the creation of additional snapshots."
