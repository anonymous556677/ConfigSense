    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'index_summary_resize_interval_in_minutes' is performance-sensitive. This is because the interval specified by this configuration directly impacts the frequency of memory redistribution for index summaries, which can have a significant effect on system performance. The code snippet provided shows that this configuration is used to set the resize interval for the index summary manager, which in turn affects the memory pool size and resampling process. Changes in this interval can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, making it a performance-sensitive configuration."
