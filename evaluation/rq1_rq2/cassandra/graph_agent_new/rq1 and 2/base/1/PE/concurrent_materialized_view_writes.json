    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'concurrent_materialized_view_writes' is performance-sensitive. The code context provided shows that this configuration directly impacts the performance by managing materialized views and providing locks to prevent incoherent updates. The 'updatesAffectView' method checks if mutations affect the views, which can have a significant impact on system performance. Additionally, the use of locks and the limitation of concurrent reads or writes for materialized views indicate that this configuration involves time-expensive and memory-expensive operations, leading to notable performance variations at the system level."
