    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'concurrent_materialized_view_builders' configuration option is performance-sensitive. This is because it directly controls the number of simultaneous materialized view builder tasks that can run in the system. Adjusting this value can significantly impact system performance by affecting the concurrency of view building operations. The code context shows that this configuration is used to set the number of concurrent view builders, which can have a notable performance impact on the system level."
