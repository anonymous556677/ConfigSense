    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'native_transport_idle_timeout_in_ms' is performance-sensitive. The code context shows that this configuration directly affects the system's performance by setting an idle timeout for client connections. If a connection remains idle for longer than the specified timeout, it will be closed, which can have a notable impact on system resources and performance. Additionally, the code snippet related to this configuration involves time-expensive operations, such as checking for idle connections and closing them, which can lead to significant performance variations at the system level."
