    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'repair_session_space_in_mb' configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the memory usage during repair operations at the system level. The configuration sets the available space for holding RF trees in memory during validation compaction, which can lead to notable performance variations. The code context shows that the configuration is used to calculate the available bytes for Merkle tree calculations, which are memory-expensive operations contributing to the overall performance of the system."
