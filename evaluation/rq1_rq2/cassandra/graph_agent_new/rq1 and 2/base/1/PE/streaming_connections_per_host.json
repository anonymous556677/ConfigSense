    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'streaming_connections_per_host' configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the number of connections per host for streaming operations. This configuration is fetched and used in the code to limit the number of connections, which can significantly affect the system's performance at the network and CPU utilization levels. Adjusting this configuration can lead to notable performance variations during streaming operations, making it a performance-sensitive configuration."
