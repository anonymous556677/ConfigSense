    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'cdc_free_space_check_interval_ms' is classified as performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the configuration directly impacts system performance by determining the frequency at which the system checks for available space in cdc_raw. This check involves time-expensive operations such as file size calculations and directory walks, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The code context also includes operations related to managing CDC segments and calculating disk usage, which are memory-expensive and contribute to system performance. Therefore, the configuration is considered performance-sensitive based on its impact on system performance and the performance-related operations within its related code."
