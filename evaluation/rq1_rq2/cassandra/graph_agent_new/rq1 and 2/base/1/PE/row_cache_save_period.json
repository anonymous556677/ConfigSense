    "classification_result": "Performance-insensitive with 100% confidence",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'Duration in seconds after which Cassandra should save the row cache' is performance-insensitive because it is related to the frequency of saving the row cache, which is a relatively cheap operation in terms of I/O. It does not involve any performance-sensitive operations or affect system performance directly."
