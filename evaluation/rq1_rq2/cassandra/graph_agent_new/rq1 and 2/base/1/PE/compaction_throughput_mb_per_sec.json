{
    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'compaction_throughput_mb_per_sec' is performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly affects the rate at which compaction operations are performed across the entire system. The code context shows that the configuration is used to set a rate limit for compaction, which can significantly impact the system's performance by controlling the speed of compaction. Additionally, the 'setRate' method further emphasizes the importance of this configuration in managing the compaction rate, indicating that it plays a crucial role in optimizing system performance. Therefore, the configuration is considered performance-sensitive as it involves performance-related operations that have a notable impact on system performance at the system level."
