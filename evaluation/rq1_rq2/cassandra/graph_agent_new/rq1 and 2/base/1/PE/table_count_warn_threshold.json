    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'table_count_warn_threshold' configuration is performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly impacts system performance by setting a threshold for the number of tables in the cluster. If the current number of tables exceeds this threshold, a warning message is logged and returned to the client, which can significantly slow down schema-dependent cluster operations. The code context shows that the configuration is triggered when creating a new table or keyspace, indicating that it involves performance-related operations that can lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
