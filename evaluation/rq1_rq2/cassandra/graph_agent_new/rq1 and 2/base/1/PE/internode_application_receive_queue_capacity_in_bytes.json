    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'internode_application_receive_queue_capacity_in_bytes' is classified as performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly affects the memory consumption and processing efficiency of the system at the system level. The code context shows that this configuration sets the capacity for the application receive queue for internode communication, which can impact the queuing of messages for delivery to the local node. Setting this value too low can lead to message loss or delays in message processing, while setting it too high can lead to increased memory usage and potential performance degradation."
