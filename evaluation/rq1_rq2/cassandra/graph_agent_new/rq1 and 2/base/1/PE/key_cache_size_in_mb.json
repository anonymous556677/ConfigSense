    "Reason": "The 'key_cache_size_in_mb' configuration is performance-sensitive. The configuration directly impacts the system performance by setting the maximum size of the key cache in memory. The code initializes the key cache with the specified capacity in megabytes, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The size impact of the configuration is significant as it affects the efficiency of cache hits and memory consumption, which are crucial factors for system performance."
