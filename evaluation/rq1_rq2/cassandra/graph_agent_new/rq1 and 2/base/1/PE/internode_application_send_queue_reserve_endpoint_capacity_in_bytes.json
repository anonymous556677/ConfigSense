    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option internode_application_send_queue_reserve_endpoint_capacity_in_bytes is classified as performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the configuration directly impacts the system performance by setting the limit on the on-wire size of messages queued for delivery to other nodes. This limit affects memory allocation for message queues and can lead to message drops or delays in message processing, impacting overall system performance. The code context shows that the configuration involves retrieving values from DatabaseDescriptor and MessagingService, indicating that it involves time-expensive and memory-expensive operations that can cause notable performance variations at the system level."
