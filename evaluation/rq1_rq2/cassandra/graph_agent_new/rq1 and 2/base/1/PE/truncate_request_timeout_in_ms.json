{
    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'truncate_request_timeout_in_ms' is classified as performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly impacts the timeout duration for truncates, which can significantly affect system performance. The code snippets related to the configuration involve time-expensive operations such as calculating timeout durations and handling timeout exceptions. These operations can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, making the configuration performance-sensitive."
