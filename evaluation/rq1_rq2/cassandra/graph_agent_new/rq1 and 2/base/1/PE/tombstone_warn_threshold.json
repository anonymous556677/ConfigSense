    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'tombstone_warn_threshold' configuration is performance-sensitive. This is because it directly affects the warning threshold for tombstones in the system, which can impact the performance and memory usage of the system. The configuration is used to adjust the warning threshold value, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level by influencing how many tombstones are kept in memory during scans. The configuration-related code context shows that the 'getTombstoneWarnThreshold' method is called to retrieve this configuration value, indicating its importance in system performance."
