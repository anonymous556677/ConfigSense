    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'repaired_data_tracking_for_range_reads_enabled' is performance-sensitive. The code context reveals that this configuration directly impacts the performance of range read operations by enabling the tracking of repaired data and comparison between replicas. The configuration involves performance-related operations such as checking if the flag is enabled and if there are multiple full replicas to compare results from before tracking the repaired status. This additional overhead in tracking the repaired state of data during reads can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, making it performance-sensitive."
