    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'allocate_tokens_for_keyspace' configuration is performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly impacts the token allocation strategy, which in turn affects the distribution of data across nodes in the system. The code context provided shows that the configuration involves operations that allocate tokens based on specified parameters like keyspace, replication factor, and number of tokens. These operations are time-expensive and memory-expensive as they involve waiting for schema updates, opening keyspaces, and allocating tokens. The allocation of tokens is crucial for the performance of the cluster as it determines the data distribution and balance across nodes. Therefore, any changes or inefficiencies in the token allocation process can lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
