    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'ideal_consistency_level' configuration is performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly impacts the selection and setup of response handlers based on the ideal consistency level. The code snippet provided shows that the configuration influences the construction of response handlers, which are crucial for handling replication and ensuring the ideal consistency level for writes without timing out. This additional logic and tracking introduced by the configuration can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, especially during write operations where replication needs to achieve the ideal consistency level. Therefore, the 'ideal_consistency_level' configuration involves performance-related operations that are time-expensive and memory-expensive, making it performance-sensitive."
