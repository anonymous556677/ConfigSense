    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'corrupted_tombstone_strategy' is performance-sensitive. The code context shows that the configuration directly impacts the handling of invalid tombstones during reads and compactions. Depending on the strategy set ('disabled', 'warn', or 'exception'), the configuration can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. For example, setting the strategy to 'exception' can result in throwing exceptions and marking SSTables as suspect, affecting future compactions. This indicates that the configuration involves performance-related operations that are time-expensive and memory-expensive, making it performance-sensitive."
