    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'write_request_timeout_in_ms' is performance-sensitive. This is because it directly impacts the timeout duration for write operations in the system, affecting the overall performance. The configuration is used in various parts of the code to set the timeout for write operations, ensuring that the coordinator waits for the specified duration before timing out. The timeout duration for write operations is critical for system performance, and any significant variation in this configuration can lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
