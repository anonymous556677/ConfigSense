    "Reason": "The 'commit_failure_policy' configuration does not involve any performance-related operations that are time-extensive or memory-extensive within its related code. The code snippet provided mainly focuses on handling different actions based on the value of the configuration when a commit error occurs. While the configuration may have a significant impact on system behavior, it does not directly and substantially affect system performance at the system level in terms of time-expensive or memory-expensive operations."
