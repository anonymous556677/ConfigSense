    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'cross_node_timeout' is performance-sensitive. The code context shows that this configuration directly impacts the behavior of the getExpiresAtNanos method, which is crucial for determining operation timeout information exchange between nodes. The method's logic involves checking the DatabaseDescriptor.hasCrossNodeTimeout() and comparing timestamps, which can lead to notable performance variations depending on the configuration state. Enabling or disabling this configuration affects the accuracy of request timeouts between nodes, potentially leading to wasted time processing timed-out requests under overload conditions. Therefore, the 'cross_node_timeout' configuration is performance-sensitive as it directly influences system performance at the system level."
