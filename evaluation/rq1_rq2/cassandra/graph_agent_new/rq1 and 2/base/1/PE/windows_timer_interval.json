    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'windows_timer_interval' is performance-sensitive. This is because it directly adjusts the system timer on Windows from the default 15ms down to the minimum of 1ms, impacting timer intervals, thread scheduling, driver interrupts, etc. This adjustment can have a significant impact on system performance at the system level. The code context shows that the configuration is applied during the activation of the daemon and also during the shutdown process, indicating its importance in system operations."
