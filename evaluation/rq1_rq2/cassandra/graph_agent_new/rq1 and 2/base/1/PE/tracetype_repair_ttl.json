    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'tracetype_repair_ttl' configuration is performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly impacts the storage space used to store tracing information for repair sessions. By setting a higher TTL value, more storage space is consumed, leading to potential performance issues related to increased memory consumption. Additionally, the configuration is triggered whenever a repair operation is initiated, which can have a notable performance impact on the system level due to the frequency of repair operations being performed."
