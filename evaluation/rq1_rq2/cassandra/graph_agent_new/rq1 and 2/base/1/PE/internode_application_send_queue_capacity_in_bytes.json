    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'internode_application_send_queue_capacity_in_bytes' is classified as performance-sensitive. This is because the method 'applicationSendQueueCapacityInBytes' directly impacts the amount of memory allocated for message queues and can affect the overall performance and resource usage of the system. The configuration involves setting a limit on the size of messages queued for delivery to other nodes in the cluster, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
