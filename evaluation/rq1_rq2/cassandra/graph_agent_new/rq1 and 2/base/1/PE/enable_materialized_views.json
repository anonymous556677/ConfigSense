{
    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'enable_materialized_views' is performance-sensitive. This is because enabling materialized views directly impacts the system performance at the system level by allowing the creation of denormalized views for faster query performance. The code context related to this configuration involves multiple performance-related operations that contribute to execution time and memory consumption. For example, the validation of base tables, processing SELECT clause, processing PRIMARY KEY columns, and CLUSTERING ORDER BY clause all involve operations that can be time-expensive and memory-expensive, leading to notable performance variations at the system level. Therefore, the configuration 'enable_materialized_views' is classified as performance-sensitive based on its direct and substantial impact on system performance."
