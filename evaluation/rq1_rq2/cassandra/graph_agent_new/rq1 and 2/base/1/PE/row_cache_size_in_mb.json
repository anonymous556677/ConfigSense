    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'row_cache_size_in_mb' configuration is classified as performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly affects the amount of memory allocated for the row cache, which can have a significant impact on system performance. The code snippets provided show that the configuration value is used to set the capacity of the cache builder and create the cache with the specified size. Allocating more memory for the row cache can lead to increased memory usage and potential performance improvements due to caching. However, over-allocating memory can also result in swapping and performance degradation, highlighting the importance of managing this configuration carefully to optimize system performance."
