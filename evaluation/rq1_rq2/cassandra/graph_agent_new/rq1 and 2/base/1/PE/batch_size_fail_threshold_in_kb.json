    "Reason": "The 'batch_size_fail_threshold_in_kb' configuration is not performance-sensitive based on the provided code context and developer information. The configuration is simply retrieving a threshold value from the DatabaseDescriptor, which does not involve any time-expensive or memory-expensive operations. Additionally, the purpose of this configuration is to set a limit on batch size to prevent system issues, rather than directly impacting system performance at a notable level."
