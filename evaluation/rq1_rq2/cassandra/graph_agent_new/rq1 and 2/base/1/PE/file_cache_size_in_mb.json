    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'file_cache_size_in_mb' configuration is performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly determines the maximum memory allocated for caching sstable chunks and pooling buffers, which are critical for system performance. The code snippet shows that the cache size calculation is based on this configuration, and it has a direct impact on the system's read and write operations on sstables. Therefore, any changes to this configuration can lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
