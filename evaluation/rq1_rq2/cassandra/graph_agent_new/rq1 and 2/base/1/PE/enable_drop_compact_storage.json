    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'enable_drop_compact_storage' is classified as performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly affects the system performance by enabling the use of 'ALTER ... DROP COMPACT STORAGE' statements, which can have implications on storage and performance. The code context shows that the configuration is checked before allowing the operation, indicating that it involves performance-related operations that can lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
