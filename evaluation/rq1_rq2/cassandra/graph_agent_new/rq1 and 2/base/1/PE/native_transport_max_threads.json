    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'native_transport_max_threads' configuration is performance-sensitive. The configuration directly impacts the concurrency level for handling incoming requests in the system. The code snippet provided shows that this configuration is used to create an executor service for processing requests, which is a time-expensive operation. The maximum number of threads set by this configuration can significantly affect the system's performance by either alleviating or causing bottlenecks in request processing. Therefore, any changes to this configuration can lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
