    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'streaming_keep_alive_period_in_secs' is performance-sensitive. This is because the value of this configuration directly impacts the frequency of keep-alive messages sent between nodes in a stream session. A shorter period would result in more frequent communication, potentially increasing system load, while a longer period may lead to session timeouts if messages are not received within the specified time. The code context provided shows that this configuration is used to schedule keep-alive tasks at a fixed rate, which directly affects system performance by determining how often these tasks are executed."
