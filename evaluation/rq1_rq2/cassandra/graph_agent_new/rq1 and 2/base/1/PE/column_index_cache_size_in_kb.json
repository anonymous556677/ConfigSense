    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'column_index_cache_size_in_kb' configuration is considered performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly impacts the amount of memory used for holding index entries in memory, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Setting a higher value may improve performance by reducing disk reads for index entries, while setting a lower value may result in more disk reads and potentially slower performance. Additionally, the method getColumnIndexCacheSize() is called in the code, indicating that this configuration is actively used and can have a significant impact on system performance."
