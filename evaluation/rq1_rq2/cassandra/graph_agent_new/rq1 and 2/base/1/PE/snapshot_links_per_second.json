    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'snapshot_links_per_second' is performance-sensitive because it directly affects system performance by controlling the rate at which snapshot operations are executed. The code context shows that the configuration is used to create a rate limiter for throttling snapshot link creation or clearing, which can have a significant impact on system performance. Additionally, the developer's explanation highlights the importance of this configuration in optimizing performance and preventing negative impacts caused by excessive snapshot operations on consumer grade SSDs."
