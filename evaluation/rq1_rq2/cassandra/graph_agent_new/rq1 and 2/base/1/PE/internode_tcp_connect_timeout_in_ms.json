    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The 'internode_tcp_connect_timeout_in_ms' configuration is not performance-sensitive based on the provided code context and developer information. The configuration is used to set the amount of time to wait for internode TCP connections to establish in Cassandra. The code snippets provided do not contain any performance-intensive operations that would lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The configuration retrieval methods simply return the value of the timeout without any complex or time-expensive computations. Additionally, the developer's explanation focuses more on the network resilience aspect of the configuration rather than its direct impact on system performance."
