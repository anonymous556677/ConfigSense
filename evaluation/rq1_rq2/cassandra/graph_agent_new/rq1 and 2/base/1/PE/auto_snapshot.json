    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The 'auto_snapshot' configuration option is not performance-sensitive based on the provided code context and developer information. The configuration mainly deals with data safety by determining whether a snapshot is taken before keyspace truncation or dropping of column families. The code related to the configuration does not involve any time-expensive or memory-expensive operations that would lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The configuration's impact is more on data safety rather than system performance."
