    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'dynamic_snitch_reset_interval_in_ms' configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the system's performance by controlling how often host scores are reset. This configuration involves time-expensive operations such as scheduling tasks for updating and resetting host scores based on the configured interval. The frequency of resetting host scores can significantly affect the system's stability and reliability, making it a crucial performance factor at the system level."
