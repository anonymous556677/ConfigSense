    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'stream_throughput_outbound_megabits_per_sec' is classified as performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly impacts the throughput of streaming file transfers between datacenters, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The 'calculateRateInBytes' method, which calculates the rate in bytes based on the configured throughput value, is a time-expensive operation that contributes to the performance sensitivity of this configuration."
