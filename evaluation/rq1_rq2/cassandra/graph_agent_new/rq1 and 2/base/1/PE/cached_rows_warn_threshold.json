    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'cached_rows_warn_threshold' configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly affects the system performance at the system level. The configuration involves retrieving the 'cached_rows_warn_threshold' value from the configuration object, which is used to limit the number of rows that can be materialized on-heap during queries. This limitation impacts the execution time and memory consumption of the system, leading to notable performance variations. Additionally, the configuration is triggered based on the breach of a per-query threshold, indicating its direct impact on system performance."
