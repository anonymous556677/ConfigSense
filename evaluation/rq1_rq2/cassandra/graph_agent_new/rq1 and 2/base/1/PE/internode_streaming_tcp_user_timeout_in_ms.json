    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'internode_streaming_tcp_user_timeout_in_ms' is performance-sensitive. This is because the timeout value set by this configuration directly impacts the processing time of incoming stream messages. If the processing time exceeds the timeout value, a warning message is logged, indicating potential closure of streaming connections due to tcp user timeout. This configuration involves time-extensive operations within the code that directly affect system performance at the system level by potentially closing streaming connections, making it performance-sensitive."
