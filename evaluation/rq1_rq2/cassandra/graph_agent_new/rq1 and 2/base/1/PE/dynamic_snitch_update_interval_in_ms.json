    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'dynamic_snitch_update_interval_in_ms' configuration is classified as performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly affects the frequency of a time-expensive operation, which is the update of host scores based on their performance. The code context reveals that the configuration controls the interval at which the update operation is scheduled to run, impacting the overall system performance. A shorter interval may increase system overhead, while a longer interval may reduce accuracy but decrease system load. Therefore, any changes to this configuration can lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
