    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'diagnostic_events_enabled' configuration is performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly impacts the flow of diagnostic event processing in the system, which involves time-expensive operations like checking for subscribers and processing events. The 'isEnabled' and 'isDiagnosticsEnabled' methods are called multiple times in different scenarios, potentially leading to notable performance variations at the system level. Enabling diagnostic events can introduce overhead in terms of event processing and storage, making it a performance-sensitive configuration."
