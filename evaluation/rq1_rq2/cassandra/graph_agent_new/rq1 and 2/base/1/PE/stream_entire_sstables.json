    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'stream_entire_sstables' configuration is classified as performance-sensitive. This is because enabling this configuration directly impacts system performance by allowing Cassandra to zero-copy stream entire eligible SSTables between nodes, which can significantly speed up network transfer and reduce GC pressure. The code context provided shows that the configuration is checked in the computeShouldStreamEntireSSTables() method, which involves performance-related operations that can have a notable performance impact at the system level."
