{
    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'network_authorizer' configuration is classified as performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the configuration directly impacts system performance by managing permissions related to network access at the data center level. The configuration involves operations that are time-expensive and memory-expensive, such as checking user access permissions and setting up network authorization rules. These operations can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, making the 'network_authorizer' configuration performance-sensitive."
