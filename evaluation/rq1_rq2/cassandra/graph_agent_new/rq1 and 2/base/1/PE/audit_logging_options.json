    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'audit_logging_options' configuration is classified as performance-sensitive. The configuration directly impacts system performance by enabling or disabling audit logging, which involves logging every incoming CQL command request and authentication to a node. This logging process can be time-expensive and memory-expensive, especially when dealing with a high volume of requests and events. The code snippets related to the configuration show that enabling audit logging triggers additional logging and processing operations, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Therefore, the configuration is considered performance-sensitive due to its direct impact on system performance and resource usage."
