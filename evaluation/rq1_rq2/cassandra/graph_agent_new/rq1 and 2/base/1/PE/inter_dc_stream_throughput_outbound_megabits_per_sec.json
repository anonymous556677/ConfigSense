    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'inter_dc_stream_throughput_outbound_megabits_per_sec' is performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly impacts the throughput of streaming file transfers between datacenters, which can have a significant effect on system performance. The code context provided shows that the configuration value is used to calculate the inter DC rate in bytes, which involves time-expensive operations based on the condition check and multiplication. Any changes to this configuration can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, making it performance-sensitive."
