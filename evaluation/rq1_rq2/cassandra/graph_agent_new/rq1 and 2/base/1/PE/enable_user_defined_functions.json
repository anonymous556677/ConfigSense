    "Reason": "The configuration 'enable_user_defined_functions' is not performance-sensitive based on the provided code context and developer information. The code snippet only checks if the configuration is enabled or not and throws an exception if it is not enabled. This check does not involve any time-expensive or memory-expensive operations that would lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The configuration mainly impacts the functionality and security of the system rather than its performance."
