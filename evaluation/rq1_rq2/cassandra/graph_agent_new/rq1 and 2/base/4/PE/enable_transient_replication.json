    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'enable_transient_replication' configuration is performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly impacts the system performance at the system level by checking if transient replication is enabled in the cassandra.yaml file before allowing the creation of keyspaces with transient replication. The code snippet related to this configuration involves operations that contribute to execution time and memory consumption, such as checking if transient replicas are enabled and throwing exceptions based on the configuration settings. These operations can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, making the configuration performance-sensitive."
