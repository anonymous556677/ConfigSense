    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'row_cache_size_in_mb' configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the memory usage of the system by setting the capacity of the row cache in bytes. The code snippets provided show that the configuration value is used to allocate memory for the row cache, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Setting a higher value for this configuration can increase memory consumption, potentially affecting system performance by consuming more system resources and potentially leading to memory-related issues such as swapping."
