    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'file_cache_enabled' configuration option is performance-sensitive because it directly affects the system's performance by determining whether the sstable chunk cache is enabled or not. Enabling the cache can significantly improve read performance by storing recently accessed sections of the sstable in-memory as uncompressed buffers, reducing the need to read from disk. The configuration-related code checks if the 'fileCacheEnabled' value from the DatabaseDescriptor is true and if the cache size is greater than 0 to create an instance of ChunkCache, which involves time-expensive and memory-expensive operations that lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
