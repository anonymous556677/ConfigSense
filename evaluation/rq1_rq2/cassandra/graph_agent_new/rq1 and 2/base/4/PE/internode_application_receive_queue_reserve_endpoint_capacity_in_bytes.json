    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'internode_application_receive_queue_reserve_endpoint_capacity_in_bytes' is performance-sensitive. This is because it directly impacts the system performance at the system level by setting limits on the per-endpoint message queue sizes for messages being sent to or received from other nodes in the cluster. By controlling the amount of memory consumed by queued messages, the configuration helps prevent overwhelming a host with enqueued, undelivered messages, thus efficiently managing memory utilization and preventing potential memory-related issues in the system. The code context related to this configuration shows that it is involved in handling outbound and inbound messaging, enqueuing messages for delivery, and processing on arrival, which are time-expensive and memory-expensive operations contributing to notable performance variations at the system level."
