{
    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'cdc_free_space_check_interval_ms' is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the configuration directly impacts the system performance by monitoring and managing the space availability for cdc-tracked tables. The code related to this configuration involves time-expensive operations such as size recalculation, file operations, and synchronization, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Additionally, the configuration is triggered at a frequency of 250 milliseconds, indicating its importance in maintaining system efficiency."
