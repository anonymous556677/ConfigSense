    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'server_encryption_options' configuration is performance-sensitive. The configuration involves setting up encryption options for server-to-server internode communication, which directly impacts system performance at the system level. The code context includes operations that create SSL contexts, validate SSL certificates, and manage SSL connections, which are time-expensive and memory-expensive operations. Enabling encryption ensures data security but may introduce performance overhead due to encryption processes. Custom encryption options can further increase complexity and potential performance impact."
