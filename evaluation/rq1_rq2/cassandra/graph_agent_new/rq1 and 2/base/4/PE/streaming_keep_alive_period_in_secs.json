    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'streaming_keep_alive_period_in_secs' is performance-sensitive. This is because the value of this configuration directly impacts the frequency of keep-alive messages sent between nodes to maintain stream sessions. A longer keep-alive period may lead to slower detection of stalled streams but reduce overhead, while a shorter keep-alive period increases responsiveness but may introduce more network traffic. The code context shows that this configuration is used to schedule keep-alive tasks at a fixed rate, which can have a notable performance impact on the system level by affecting the stability and reliability of streaming sessions."
