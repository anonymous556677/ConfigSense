    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'num_tokens' configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the data distribution and storage load balance across the cluster. The number of tokens assigned to a node affects the proportion of data stored by that node, which can lead to uneven data distribution and performance issues if not properly configured. The code snippet related to 'num_tokens' involves operations that check the number of tokens and handle token allocation, which are time-expensive and memory-expensive operations contributing to notable performance variations at the system level."
