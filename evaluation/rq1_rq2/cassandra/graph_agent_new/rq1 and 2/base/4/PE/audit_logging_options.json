    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The audit_logging_options configuration is considered performance-sensitive. The configuration directly impacts system performance by enabling audit logging, which adds overhead to log every incoming CQL command request and authentication. This can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, especially if audit logging is enabled for a large number of requests. The code context shows that the configuration involves performance-related operations such as logging and filtering audit information, which are time-expensive and memory-expensive operations. Therefore, the configuration is performance-sensitive based on its impact on system performance and the performance-related operations within its related code."
