    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'cdc_total_space_in_mb' is classified as performance-sensitive. This is because the total space available for change-data-capture logs on disk directly impacts the system's performance and stability. The code snippet provided shows that the configuration value is multiplied by 1024*1024 to convert it to bytes, indicating a memory-expensive operation. If the space usage exceeds the configured value, it can lead to WriteTimeoutException on Mutations, causing notable performance variations at the system level."
