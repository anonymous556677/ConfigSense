    "Reason": "The 'tombstone_warn_threshold' configuration option is not performance-sensitive. The configuration is used to retrieve a threshold value from the DatabaseDescriptor, which does not involve any performance-related operations that significantly impact system performance. The method 'getTombstoneWarnThreshold' simply returns the threshold value when needed, without causing notable performance variations at the system level."
