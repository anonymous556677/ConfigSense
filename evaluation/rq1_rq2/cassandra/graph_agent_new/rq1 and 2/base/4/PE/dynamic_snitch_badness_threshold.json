    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'dynamic_snitch_badness_threshold' configuration is performance-sensitive. This configuration directly influences the behavior of the dynamic snitch in the system, affecting how replicas are chosen for read operations based on their performance. The code context shows that changes in the dynamicUpdateInterval, dynamicResetInterval, or dynamicBadnessThreshold trigger corresponding scheduler tasks, indicating that this configuration has a significant impact on system performance at the system level."
