    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'auto_snapshot' configuration option is performance-sensitive. The configuration directly impacts system performance by determining whether a snapshot is taken before keyspace truncation or dropping of column families. This decision affects the execution time and memory consumption of the system, as indicated by the code context. The configuration-related code includes operations such as flushing memtables, snapshotting, and discarding SSTables, which are time-expensive and memory-expensive. These operations contribute significantly to system performance variations at the system level, making the 'auto_snapshot' configuration performance-sensitive."
