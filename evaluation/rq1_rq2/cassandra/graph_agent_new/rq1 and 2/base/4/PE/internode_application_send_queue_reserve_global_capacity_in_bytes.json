    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'internode_application_send_queue_reserve_global_capacity_in_bytes' is classified as performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly impacts the amount of queued messages for delivery and processing within the cluster, which can have a significant effect on system performance. The code context provided also indicates that the configuration is related to scheduling unused connection monitoring, which suggests that it involves time-expensive operations. Therefore, the configuration can lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
