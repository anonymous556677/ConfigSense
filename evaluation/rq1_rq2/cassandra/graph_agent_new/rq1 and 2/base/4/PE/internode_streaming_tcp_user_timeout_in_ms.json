    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'internode_streaming_tcp_user_timeout_in_ms' is performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly affects the stability and performance of streaming connections in the system at the system level. The code snippet provided shows that the configuration is used to check the latency of processing incoming stream messages against the timeout value and log a warning if the processing time exceeds the configured timeout. This operation is time-expensive and can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, making it performance-sensitive."
