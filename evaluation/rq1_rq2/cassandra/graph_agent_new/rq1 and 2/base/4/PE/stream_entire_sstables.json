    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'stream_entire_sstables' configuration is performance-sensitive. This is because enabling this configuration directly impacts system performance by allowing Cassandra to zero-copy stream entire eligible SSTables between nodes, which can significantly speed up network transfer and reduce GC pressure. The code context shows that the configuration is checked in the computeShouldStreamEntireSSTables() method, where it evaluates conditions related to streaming entire SSTables. If these conditions are met, the method returns true, indicating a notable performance variation at the system level."
