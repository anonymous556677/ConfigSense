    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'counter_cache_size_in_mb' configuration is classified as performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly impacts the maximum size of the counter cache in memory, which can significantly affect system performance. The code snippet provided initializes the counter cache with the specified capacity in MBs, and the size of the cache can have a notable impact on memory consumption and cache efficiency. Adjusting the size of the counter cache can lead to performance variations at the system level, making it a performance-sensitive configuration."
