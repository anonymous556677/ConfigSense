    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'cas_contention_timeout_in_ms' is performance-sensitive. The configuration directly affects the system performance by determining how long a coordinator should continue to retry CAS operations that contend with other proposals. This timeout value influences the execution time and memory consumption of the system by controlling the duration of retrying Paxos rounds. The code context shows that the configuration is used in a loop in the 'doPaxos' method, where the timeout defined by the configuration impacts the frequency of retries. A lower value can lead to more contention and potentially higher performance impact, while a higher value can reduce contention but may also affect performance. Therefore, the configuration's significant impact on system performance and the presence of time-expensive operations in the code make it performance-sensitive."
