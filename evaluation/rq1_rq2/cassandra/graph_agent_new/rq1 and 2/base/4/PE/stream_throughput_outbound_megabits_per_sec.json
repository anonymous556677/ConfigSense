    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'stream_throughput_outbound_megabits_per_sec' is classified as performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly impacts the outbound stream throughput in megabits per second, which can throttle all streaming file transfers between datacenters. The 'setStreamThroughputMbPerSec' method allows users to set a new value for this configuration, which in turn affects the system performance and resource utilization. Additionally, the 'calculateRateInBytes' method calculates the rate in bytes based on the configured throughput, indicating that the configuration involves performance-related operations that contribute to notable performance variations at the system level."
