    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'client_encryption_options' configuration is performance-sensitive. The configuration involves creating SSL contexts, handling encryption policies, and validating SSL certificates, which directly impact system performance at the system level. The SSL contexts created are expensive to create and consume a lot of resources, especially direct memory. Additionally, the configuration triggers periodic checks for certificate updates and reloads SSL contexts, adding overhead to the system. The configuration-related code contains operations that are time-expensive and memory-expensive, contributing to notable performance variations at the system level."
