    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'concurrent_compactors' configuration is performance-sensitive. This is because it directly impacts the number of simultaneous compactions allowed, which can significantly affect system performance by optimizing compaction efficiency and read performance. The configuration controls the workload distribution during compaction tasks, preventing data accumulation and resource contention. The code context shows that the configuration is crucial for managing compaction tasks efficiently and maintaining system performance at the system level."
