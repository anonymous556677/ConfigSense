    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'write_request_timeout_in_ms' is performance-sensitive. It directly affects the timeout for write operations in the system, which can have a notable impact on system performance. The configuration is used to calculate the timeout for write operations, and a lower or higher value can significantly affect the time taken for write operations to complete, leading to notable performance variations at the system level."
