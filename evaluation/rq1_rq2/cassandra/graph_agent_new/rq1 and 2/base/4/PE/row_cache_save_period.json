    "classification_result": "Performance-insensitive with 100% confidence",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'Duration in seconds after which Cassandra should save the row cache' is performance-insensitive because it only determines the frequency at which the row cache is saved to disk for cold-start speeds. This operation is relatively cheap in terms of I/O for the key cache and does not directly impact system performance."
