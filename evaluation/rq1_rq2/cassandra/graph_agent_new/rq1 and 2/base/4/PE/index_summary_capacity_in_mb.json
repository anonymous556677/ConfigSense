    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'index_summary_capacity_in_mb' is classified as performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the configuration directly impacts the memory usage and resizing process of index summaries at the system level. The code context shows that the configuration value is used to set the memory pool size for index summaries, which can lead to notable performance variations based on the memory usage of SSTables. Additionally, the developer's explanation indicates that exceeding the configured limit can trigger resizing operations, affecting system performance. Therefore, the configuration involves performance-related operations that are memory-expensive and can have a significant impact on system performance."
