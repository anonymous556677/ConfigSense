    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'repaired_data_tracking_for_range_reads_enabled' is classified as performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly impacts the system performance by adding overhead to range reads with repaired data tracking. The code snippet shows that the configuration is checked and used to determine whether to request repaired data tracking info from full replicas during range reads. This additional operation can significantly affect the execution time and memory consumption at the system level, leading to notable performance variations."
