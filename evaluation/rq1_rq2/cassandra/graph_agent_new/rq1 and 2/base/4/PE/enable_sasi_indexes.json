    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The 'enable_sasi_indexes' configuration is not performance-sensitive based on the provided code context and developer information. The configuration is primarily checking if SASI indexes are enabled in the Cassandra cluster and throwing an exception if they are disabled. This check does not involve any performance-related operations that significantly impact system performance. Additionally, enabling SASI indexes through this configuration is experimental and not recommended for production use, which indicates that it may introduce instability or performance issues, but the configuration itself is not directly causing notable performance variations at the system level."
