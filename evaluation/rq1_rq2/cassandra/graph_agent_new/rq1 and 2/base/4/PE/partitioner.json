    "classification_result": "Performance-insensitive with 100% confidence",
    "Reason": "The partitioner configuration option is related to how data is distributed across nodes in the cluster based on the partition key. Changing the partitioner does not directly impact system performance, but rather affects data distribution and compatibility. It does not involve performance-related operations or affect system performance, and is unrelated to any time-dependent aspects of system operation."
