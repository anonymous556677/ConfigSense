    "Reason": "The 'hints_compression' configuration is not performance-sensitive based on the provided code context and developer information. The configuration is used to specify the compression to apply to hint files, which may impact disk space usage and read/write operations but does not involve any time-extensive or memory-extensive operations that would lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The code snippet related to the configuration simply creates a map with compression parameters and does not involve any performance-intensive operations."
