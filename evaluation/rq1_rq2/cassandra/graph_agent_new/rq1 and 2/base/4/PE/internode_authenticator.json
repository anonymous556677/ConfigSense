    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The 'internode_authenticator' configuration option is not performance-sensitive based on the provided code context and developer information. The configuration primarily deals with setting the internode authentication backend for peer node connections, which is more focused on security and authentication rather than performance optimization. The code related to this configuration does not involve any performance-intensive operations that would lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Therefore, it is classified as not performance-sensitive."
