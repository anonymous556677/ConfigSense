    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The initial_token configuration is classified as performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly impacts the token generation process, which is crucial for data distribution and load balancing in the cluster. The code snippet provided shows that the configuration involves operations that can be time-expensive, such as generating tokens based on user input or random selection. These operations can have a notable performance impact at the system level, especially when dealing with a large number of nodes or data. Therefore, the configuration is considered performance-sensitive based on its direct influence on system performance."
