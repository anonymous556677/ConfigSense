    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'tombstone_failure_threshold' configuration is performance-sensitive. The configuration directly impacts the handling of tombstone failures, which can significantly affect system performance and stability. The 'getTombstoneFailureThreshold' method is called to retrieve this configuration value, indicating its importance in the system. The configuration is related to critical operations that can lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
