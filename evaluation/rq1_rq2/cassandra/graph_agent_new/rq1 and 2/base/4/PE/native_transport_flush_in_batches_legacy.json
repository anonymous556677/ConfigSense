    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'native_transport_flush_in_batches_legacy' is classified as performance-sensitive. This is because enabling this configuration directly affects system performance by enabling native transport TCP message coalescing, which can significantly impact throughput, especially for systems with old kernels or very few client connections. The code context shows that this configuration is checked and used during the initialization of the Server class, indicating that it involves performance-related operations that are time-expensive and can lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
