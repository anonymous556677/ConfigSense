    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'dynamic_snitch_update_interval_in_ms' configuration is performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly affects the frequency at which the more expensive part of host score calculation is performed in the dynamic endpoint snitch of Cassandra. The code context shows that the configuration controls the update and reset intervals for the dynamic endpoint snitch, which are critical for determining the performance of the system. Changes in the dynamic update interval or reset interval trigger the applyConfigChanges() method, which updates the corresponding intervals. These time-expensive operations directly impact the system performance at the system level, making the configuration performance-sensitive."
