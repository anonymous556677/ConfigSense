    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'native_transport_allow_older_protocols' is performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration is directly used in the code to determine the protocol version to use during the decoding of CQL messages. The 'decode' method in the ProtocolVersion class checks if older protocol versions should be honored based on this configuration. If older protocols are allowed, it may introduce additional processing overhead and memory consumption during the decoding process, leading to notable performance variations at the system level. Therefore, the configuration's impact on performance is significant and qualifies it as performance-sensitive."
