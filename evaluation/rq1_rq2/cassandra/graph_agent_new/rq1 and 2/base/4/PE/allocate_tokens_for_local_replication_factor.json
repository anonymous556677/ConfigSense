    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'allocate_tokens_for_local_replication_factor' configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the token allocation process, which is crucial for data distribution and replication within the cluster. The code snippet provided shows that the configuration determines whether to use specified tokens, allocate tokens based on keyspace, or choose random tokens. These operations are time-expensive and memory-expensive as they involve token generation and distribution, which can significantly affect system performance at the cluster level. Therefore, the configuration is considered performance-sensitive based on its direct and substantial impact on system performance."
