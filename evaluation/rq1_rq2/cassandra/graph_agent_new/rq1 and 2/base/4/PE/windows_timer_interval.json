    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'windows_timer_interval' is performance-sensitive. The code context shows that this configuration directly adjusts the system timer on Windows, impacting timer intervals, thread scheduling, driver interrupts, etc. Lowering the Windows timer interval can significantly affect system performance by providing tighter latency and better throughput. The configuration involves time-expensive operations that directly impact system performance at the system level, making it performance-sensitive."
