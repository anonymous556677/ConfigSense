    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'file_cache_size_in_mb' configuration is performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly determines the maximum memory allocated for sstable chunk cache and buffer pooling in the system. The calculation of cache size based on the value obtained from DatabaseDescriptor.getFileCacheSizeInMB() and the subtraction of a reserved pool space of 32MB indicate that this configuration has a significant impact on memory usage and system performance. The configuration-related code context shows that the cache size calculation is crucial for enabling or disabling the ChunkCache instance based on the calculated cache size, which directly affects system-level performance."
