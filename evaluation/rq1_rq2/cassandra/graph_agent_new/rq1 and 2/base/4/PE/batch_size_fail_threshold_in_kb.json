    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'batch_size_fail_threshold_in_kb' is performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly impacts the system's performance by determining when a batch operation will fail. The code context shows that the configuration value is retrieved and used in determining the failure threshold for multiple-partition batches. Setting this value too low can lead to frequent batch failures, impacting system performance. Conversely, setting it too high can result in inefficient resource usage and potential performance issues. Therefore, the configuration involves performance-related operations that have a significant impact on system performance, making it performance-sensitive."
