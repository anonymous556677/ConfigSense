    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'enable_user_defined_functions' is performance-sensitive. This is because the 'enable_user_defined_functions' configuration directly impacts the execution of user-defined functions in the system, which can be time-expensive and memory-expensive operations. The code context provided shows that the configuration is checked in the assertUdfsEnabled method, which is triggered whenever user-defined functions are used. Enabling user-defined functions can introduce security risks, as noted in the developer's understanding, which further emphasizes the performance sensitivity of this configuration."
