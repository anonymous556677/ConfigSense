    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option internode_application_send_queue_reserve_endpoint_capacity_in_bytes is performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly impacts the per-endpoint limit for messages queued for delivery to other nodes, affecting the message queue size and potentially leading to message drops or delays in delivery. The code context shows that the configuration sets the applicationReserveSendQueueEndpointCapacityInBytes based on default or provided values, which are critical for controlling the system's message queue behavior. Any changes in this configuration can have a significant impact on system performance at the system level."
