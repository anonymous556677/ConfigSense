    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'internode_application_receive_queue_reserve_global_capacity_in_bytes' is considered performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the memory consumption of the system at a significant level. The code context provided shows that this configuration sets a global limit on the size of messages queued for delivery and processing, affecting the memory allocation for message queues. This can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, such as message queue congestion or unnecessary memory consumption, depending on the specified global capacity in bytes. Therefore, the configuration involves memory-expensive operations that have a substantial impact on system performance."
