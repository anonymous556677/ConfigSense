    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'enable_materialized_views' configuration is performance-sensitive. The configuration directly impacts the system performance by enabling or disabling the use of materialized views. Materialized views can have a significant performance impact due to denormalization and additional maintenance overhead. The code snippet related to this configuration includes multiple validations and processing steps that involve time-expensive operations such as column selection, primary key validation, and WHERE clause processing. These operations can lead to notable performance variations at the system level when creating or updating keyspaces and tables with materialized views."
