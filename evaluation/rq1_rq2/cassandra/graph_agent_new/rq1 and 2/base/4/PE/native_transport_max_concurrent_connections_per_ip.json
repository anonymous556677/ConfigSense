    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'native_transport_max_concurrent_connections_per_ip' is performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly affects the system performance by limiting the number of concurrent client connections per source IP. The code related to this configuration performs time-expensive operations such as incrementing and checking connection counts per IP, and memory-expensive operations such as maintaining a connectionsPerClient map. Exceeding the configured limit results in closing connections, which can have a notable impact on system performance at the system level."
