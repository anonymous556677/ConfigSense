    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'cached_rows_warn_threshold' is performance-sensitive. This is because the value of 'cached_rows_warn_threshold' directly affects the behavior of the ReplicaFilteringProtection, which is a critical component in ensuring query results are accurate and consistent. The configuration is used to limit the number of rows that can be materialized on-heap, impacting the efficiency of query processing and read consistency. Adjusting this threshold can have a notable performance impact at the system level by controlling the amount of data processed and potentially improving query response times."
