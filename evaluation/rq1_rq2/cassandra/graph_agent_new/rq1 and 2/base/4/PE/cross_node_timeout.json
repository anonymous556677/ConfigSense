    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'cross_node_timeout' configuration is performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly impacts the operation timeout information exchange between nodes, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The code context shows that the configuration check in the getExpiresAtNanos method can potentially contribute to execution time if enabled, especially when createdAtNanos is adjusted based on the currentTimeNanos. Additionally, the developer's explanation on size impact highlights the importance of accurate timeout measurements between nodes for system efficiency, further emphasizing the performance sensitivity of this configuration."
