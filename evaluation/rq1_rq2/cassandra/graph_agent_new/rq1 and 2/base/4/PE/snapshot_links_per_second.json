    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'snapshot_links_per_second' is performance-sensitive. The code context shows that the configuration is used to create a RateLimiter object, which indicates that it is involved in time-expensive operations. Additionally, the developer's explanation highlights that setting a non-zero value for this configuration can throttle the creation or clearing of snapshot links to avoid negative performance impact, especially on consumer grade SSDs. This suggests that the configuration directly and substantially affects system performance at the system level, making it performance-sensitive."
