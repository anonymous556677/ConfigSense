    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The configuration option internode_tcp_user_timeout_in_ms is not considered performance-sensitive based on the provided code context and developer information. The code snippet shows that the configuration is used to set the amount of time to wait for internode TCP connections to establish, and it retrieves the value based on the connection category from the DatabaseDescriptor. The configuration does not involve any performance-intensive operations that would lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Additionally, the developer's understanding of the configuration's impact on system behavior and network partitions indicates that it is more focused on functionality and reliability rather than performance optimization."
