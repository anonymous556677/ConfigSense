    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'internode_application_send_queue_capacity_in_bytes' is performance-sensitive. This is because the size of the application send queue capacity directly impacts the performance and stability of the system. Exceeding the set capacity can lead to message drops or delays in message delivery, which can have a notable performance impact at the system level. Additionally, the code context shows that the configuration involves retrieving the capacity value and has a direct impact on the execution time and memory consumption of the system."
