    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'concurrent_materialized_view_builders' is performance-sensitive. This is because it directly affects the number of simultaneous materialized view builder tasks allowed, which can impact system performance by controlling the concurrency of view building operations. The code context reveals that this configuration is used to set and retrieve the number of concurrent view builders, which are essential for efficient materialized view building. Therefore, changes to this configuration can have a notable performance impact on the system by influencing the concurrency of view building tasks."
