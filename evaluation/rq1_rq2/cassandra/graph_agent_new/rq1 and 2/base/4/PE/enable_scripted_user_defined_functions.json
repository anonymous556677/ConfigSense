    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'enable_scripted_user_defined_functions' is performance-sensitive. This is because enabling or disabling scripted user-defined functions directly impacts the system's performance at the system level. The code context shows that the configuration is checked in the assertUdfsEnabled method, which is a performance-related operation as it can lead to notable performance variations. Additionally, enabling scripted user-defined functions introduces security risks that need to be considered, indicating a substantial impact on system performance."
