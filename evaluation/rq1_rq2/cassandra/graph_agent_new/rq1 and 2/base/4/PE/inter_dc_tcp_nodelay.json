    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'inter_dc_tcp_nodelay' is classified as performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly impacts the performance of inter-dc communication by enabling or disabling the tcp_nodelay flag. Enabling tcp_nodelay results in smaller network packets being sent, reducing overhead and improving latency, while disabling it results in larger packets being sent, increasing latency. The code context shows that the configuration involves performance-related operations that determine the tcp_nodelay setting based on the data center location, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
