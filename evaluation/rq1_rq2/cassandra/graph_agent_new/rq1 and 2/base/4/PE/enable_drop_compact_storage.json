    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'enable_drop_compact_storage' is classified as performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly impacts the system performance at the system level by enabling or disabling the usage of 'ALTER ... DROP COMPACT STORAGE' statements on tables. The code context provided contains performance-related operations that are time-expensive, such as checking the 'DatabaseDescriptor.enableDropCompactStorage()' method, and memory-expensive, such as handling table flags based on the result of the method. These operations can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, making the configuration performance-sensitive."
