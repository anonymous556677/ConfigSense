    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The 'tracetype_query_ttl' configuration is not performance-sensitive based on the provided code context and developer's information. The configuration is primarily used to set TTL values for different trace types during the logging of trace sessions. While it plays a role in managing the lifespan of trace data, it does not involve any performance-intensive operations that would lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The code snippet related to this configuration focuses on defining trace types and retrieving TTL values, which are not time-expensive or memory-expensive operations."
