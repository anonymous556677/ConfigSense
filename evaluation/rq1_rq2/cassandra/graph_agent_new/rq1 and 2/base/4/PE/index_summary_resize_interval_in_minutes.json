    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'index_summary_resize_interval_in_minutes' is performance-sensitive. This is because the interval set for resampling index summaries directly impacts the memory redistribution process in the system, which can have a significant effect on system performance. The code context shows that the configuration value is used to determine the interval for resampling index summaries, which involves memory-expensive operations. Changing this interval can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, making it a performance-sensitive configuration."
