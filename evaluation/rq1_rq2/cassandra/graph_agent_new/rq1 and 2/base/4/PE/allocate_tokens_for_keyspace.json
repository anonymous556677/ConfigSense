    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'allocate_tokens_for_keyspace' configuration is performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly impacts the token allocation strategy for new nodes joining the cluster, which in turn affects the distribution of data across the cluster and can impact the performance and load balancing of the system. The code context shows that the configuration involves time-expensive operations such as generating suitable tokens using an algorithm and choosing tokens at random, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
