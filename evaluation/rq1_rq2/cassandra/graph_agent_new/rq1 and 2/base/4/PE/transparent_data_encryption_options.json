    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'transparent_data_encryption_options' is performance-sensitive. The code context provided includes operations for reading and handling encrypted data at-rest, which involve encryption and decryption processes. These operations are time-expensive and memory-expensive, leading to notable performance variations at the system level. Additionally, the developer's understanding mentions that this configuration impacts system performance slightly due to the overhead of encryption and decryption operations, further supporting the classification of performance sensitivity."
