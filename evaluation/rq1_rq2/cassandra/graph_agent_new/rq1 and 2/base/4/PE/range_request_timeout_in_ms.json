    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'range_request_timeout_in_ms' is classified as performance-sensitive. This classification is based on the fact that the configuration directly affects the maximum time the coordinator will wait for sequential or index scans to complete, which can have a significant impact on system performance. The code context shows that the 'getRangeRpcTimeout' method is called multiple times, indicating that this configuration is crucial for determining timeout values in performance-critical operations like index scans. Therefore, any changes to this configuration can lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
