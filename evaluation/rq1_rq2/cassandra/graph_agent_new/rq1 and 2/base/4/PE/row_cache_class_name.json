    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'row_cache_class_name' configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly determines the type of row cache implementation to be used, which can have varying performance characteristics and memory usage. The code dynamically instantiates the corresponding cache provider class based on this configuration, which involves time-expensive operations like class instantiation and initialization. The choice of cache provider class can significantly impact system performance and resource utilization at the system level."
