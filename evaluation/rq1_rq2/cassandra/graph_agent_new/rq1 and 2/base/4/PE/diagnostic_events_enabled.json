    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'diagnostic_events_enabled' configuration is classified as performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly impacts the system performance by determining whether diagnostic events are enabled or not. The 'isEnabled' method checks this configuration before executing certain actions, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level depending on the frequency of diagnostic events being published and the number of subscribers. Enabling diagnostic events can increase system overhead due to the processing and storage of these events, making it a performance-sensitive configuration."
