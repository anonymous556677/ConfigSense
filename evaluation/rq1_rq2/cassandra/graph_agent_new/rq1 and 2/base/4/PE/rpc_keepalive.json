    "classification_result": "Performance-insensitive with 100% confidence",
    "Reason": "The configuration option of enabling or disabling keepalive on rpc/native connections is not performance-sensitive as it does not directly impact system performance. Keepalive is a feature that helps maintain the connection between client and server, but it does not involve any time-dependent aspects or performance-related operations that would affect overall system performance."
