    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'cached_rows_fail_threshold' configuration is performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly impacts the resolution process with replica filtering protection, which involves time-extensive operations such as short-read protection, merge listener, and completing potentially out-of-date rows. The configuration sets a threshold for the number of cached replica rows that can fail before triggering a protection mechanism, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Additionally, the configuration involves memory-expensive operations like caching valid data for potentially out-of-date rows, which further contributes to its performance sensitivity."
