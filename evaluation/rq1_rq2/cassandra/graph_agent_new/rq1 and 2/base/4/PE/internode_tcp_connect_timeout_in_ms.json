    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'internode_tcp_connect_timeout_in_ms' is performance-sensitive. The tcpConnectTimeoutInMS() method directly retrieves the value of the configuration, which is crucial for setting the amount of time to wait for internode tcp connections to establish in Cassandra. This configuration directly impacts the system performance by potentially causing delays or failures in establishing internode tcp connections, which can have a significant impact on the overall system performance. Therefore, the configuration involves performance-related operations that are time-sensitive and memory-sensitive, leading to notable performance variations at the system level."
