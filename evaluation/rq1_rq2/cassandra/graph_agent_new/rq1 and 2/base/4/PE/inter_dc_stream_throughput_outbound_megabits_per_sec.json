    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'inter_dc_stream_throughput_outbound_megabits_per_sec' is classified as performance-sensitive based on the provided code context. The methods setInterDCStreamThroughputMbPerSec and calculateInterDCRateInBytes directly interact with the configuration value and perform calculations that impact the rate of data transfer between datacenters. The setInterDCStreamThroughputMbPerSec method sets the throughput value, which can throttle the streaming file transfer, while the calculateInterDCRateInBytes method calculates the inter-DC rate in bytes based on the configured throughput value. These operations are time-expensive and memory-expensive, leading to notable performance variations at the system level when the configuration is adjusted. Therefore, the configuration is considered performance-sensitive."
