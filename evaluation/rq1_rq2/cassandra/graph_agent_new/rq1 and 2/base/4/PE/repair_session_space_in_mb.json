    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'repair_session_space_in_mb' is performance-sensitive. This is because the value of 'repair_session_space_in_mb' directly impacts the memory usage during repair operations, affecting the system performance at the system level. The code context shows that the configuration value is used to calculate the available memory for creating Merkle trees, which are memory-expensive operations. Adjusting this configuration can lead to notable performance variations in terms of memory consumption during repair sessions, making it a performance-sensitive configuration."
