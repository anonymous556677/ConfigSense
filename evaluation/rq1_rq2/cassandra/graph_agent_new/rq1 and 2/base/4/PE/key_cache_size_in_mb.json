    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'key_cache_size_in_mb' configuration is performance-sensitive. The configuration directly impacts the system performance by setting the maximum size of the key cache in memory. The code initializes the key cache with the specified capacity in MBs, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. A larger key cache size can improve performance by reducing seek times for cache hits, while a smaller size may lead to less efficient caching and potentially slower performance. The configuration involves performance-related operations that are memory-expensive, as it allocates memory based on the specified size, which can have a significant impact on system performance."
