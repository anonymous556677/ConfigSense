    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'native_transport_max_frame_size_in_mb' is performance-sensitive. This is because the size of the frames being processed directly impacts system performance at the system level. Changing this configuration can lead to notable performance variations, as it affects the maximum allowed size of frames and can potentially impact memory consumption and execution time. The code context reveals that this configuration is crucial for handling message envelopes and headers, which are essential for communication between nodes. Therefore, any changes to this configuration can have a significant impact on system performance."
