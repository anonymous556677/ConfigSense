    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'counter_write_request_timeout_in_ms' configuration is classified as performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly impacts the system performance by determining how long the coordinator should wait for counter writes to complete. The code snippet provided includes multiple methods that retrieve the configured timeout value in different units and use it in calculations to determine the current timeout for counter writes. The timeout value plays a crucial role in the timing of write operations, which can significantly affect the overall system performance at the system level."
