{
    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'internode_socket_send_buffer_size_in_bytes' is considered performance-sensitive. The code context reveals that this configuration directly impacts the socket buffer size for internode communication, which can significantly affect the performance and efficiency of internode communication in the system. The method 'socketSendBufferSizeInBytes' is triggered whenever the socketSendBufferSizeInBytes is accessed in the code, indicating that this configuration is actively used. Additionally, the method 'getInternodeSocketSendBufferSizeInBytes' is directly related to this configuration parameter, further emphasizing its importance in system performance."
