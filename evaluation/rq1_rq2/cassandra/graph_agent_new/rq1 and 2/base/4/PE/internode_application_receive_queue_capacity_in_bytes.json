    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'internode_application_receive_queue_capacity_in_bytes' is performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly affects the memory utilization of the system by limiting the size of messages queued for delivery to the local node from other nodes in the cluster. Setting this configuration too low may lead to dropped messages or increased latency, while setting it too high may consume excessive memory. The code context shows that this configuration is crucial for handling inbound messages efficiently, and any changes to this configuration can have a significant impact on the system's performance at the system level."
