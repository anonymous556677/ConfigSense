    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'ideal_consistency_level' configuration is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the configuration directly impacts the performance of the system by adding additional tracking and handling logic for replication to ensure the ideal consistency level is achieved for writes. This involves time-expensive operations like setting up response handlers based on the ideal consistency level, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The code context shows that the configuration is triggered for every write operation involving replication, which can further amplify its performance impact."
