{
    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'streaming_connections_per_host' is performance-sensitive. This classification is based on the fact that the configuration directly affects the number of connections per host for streaming, which can have a significant impact on system performance at the system level. The code snippet provided shows that the configuration is used as a parameter in the RangeStreamer constructor, which is a performance-related operation contributing to execution time and memory consumption. By adjusting this configuration, the system can potentially improve performance by optimizing the streaming process and distributing workload efficiently. Therefore, the configuration is considered performance-sensitive as it involves time-extensive and memory-extensive operations within its related code and can lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
