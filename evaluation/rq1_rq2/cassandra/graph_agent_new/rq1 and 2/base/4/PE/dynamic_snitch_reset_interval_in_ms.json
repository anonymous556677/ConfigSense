    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'dynamic_snitch_reset_interval_in_ms' is performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly impacts the behavior of the dynamic snitch in the system, affecting how often host scores are reset. The code initializes schedulers to update and reset scores at the specified interval, indicating that the configuration involves time-expensive operations that can lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
