Options are:  none : Flush without compressing blocks but while still doing checksums. fast : Flush with a fast compressor. If the table is already using a fast compressor that compressor is used. table: Always flush with the same compressor that the table uses. This was the pre 4.0 behavior. ",

Depending on the operation type (in this case, 'FLUSH'), a specific compression algorithm is selected based on the value of 'DatabaseDescriptor.getFlushCompression()'. If the selected compression algorithm is 'none', the compression parameters are set to 'CompressionParams.NOOP'. If it is 'fast' and the current compressor does not support fast compression, the compression parameters are set to 'CompressionParams.DEFAULT'. If it is 'table' or default, no specific action is taken.",

Choosing the appropriate compression algorithm can affect the throughput of the system, especially for large tables. Using a high ratio compressor like LZ4HC, Zstd, or Deflate can potentially block flush operations for too long, hence the default behavior is to use a fast compressor in those cases to avoid performance degradation."
