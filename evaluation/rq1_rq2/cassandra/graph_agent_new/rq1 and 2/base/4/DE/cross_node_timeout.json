If disabled, replicas will assume that requests were forwarded to them instantly by the coordinator, which means that under overload conditions we will waste that much extra time processing already-timed-out requests.  Warning: It is generally assumed that users have setup NTP on their clusters, and that clocks are modestly in sync, since this is a requirement for general correctness of last write wins.",
    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The 'cross_node_timeout' configuration is checked in the getExpiresAtNanos method to determine if operation timeout information exchange between nodes should be enabled. If the configuration is enabled and the createdAtNanos is greater than the currentTimeNanos, the createdAtNanos is set to the currentTimeNanos. The method then returns the calculated expiration time.",

If disabled, replicas will assume requests were forwarded instantly, potentially leading to wasted time processing already-timed-out requests under overload conditions. It is important to note that this configuration assumes that users have NTP setup on their clusters and that clocks are in sync for general correctness of last write wins."
