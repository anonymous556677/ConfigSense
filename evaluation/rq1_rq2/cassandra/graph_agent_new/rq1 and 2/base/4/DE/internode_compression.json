If set to 'all', it will compress all traffic between nodes which can reduce network bandwidth usage but increase CPU utilization. If set to 'dc', it will only compress traffic between different datacenters, which can still reduce network bandwidth usage but to a lesser extent compared to 'all'. If set to 'none', no compression will be applied which may lead to higher network bandwidth usage."
