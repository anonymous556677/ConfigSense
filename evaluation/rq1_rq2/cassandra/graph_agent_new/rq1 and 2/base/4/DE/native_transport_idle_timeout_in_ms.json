    "config_description": "Controls when idle client connections are closed. Idle connections are ones that had neither reads nor writes for a time period.  Clients may implement heartbeats by sending OPTIONS native protocol message after a timeout, which will reset idle timeout timer on the server side. To close idle client connections, corresponding values for heartbeat intervals have to be set on the client side.  Idle connection timeouts are disabled by default.",
    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The configuration 'native_transport_idle_timeout_in_ms' controls when idle client connections are closed. It checks if the idle timeout value is greater than 0, then adds an IdleStateHandler to the channel's pipeline. This handler will close the client connection after the specified idle timeout period.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The triggering frequency of the 'native_transport_idle_timeout_in_ms' configuration depends on the idle behavior of client connections. If a client connection remains idle for the specified timeout period, the configuration will be triggered to close the connection.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the 'native_transport_idle_timeout_in_ms' configuration option is that it helps in managing idle client connections and prevents resource wastage. By closing idle connections, it can free up resources and improve the overall performance of the system."
