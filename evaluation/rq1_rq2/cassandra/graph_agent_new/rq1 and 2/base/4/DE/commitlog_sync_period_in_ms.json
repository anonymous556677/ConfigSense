    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The configuration 'commitlog_sync_period_in_ms' is used in the code to determine the blockMillis value for periodic commit log sync. If the 'periodic_commitlog_sync_lag_block_in_ms' is not set, it defaults to 1.5 times the commit log sync period. The configuration is used to control the frequency of periodic commit log sync.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The 'commitlog_sync_period_in_ms' configuration is triggered whenever the periodic commit log sync is performed, which is typically based on the commit log sync period set in the system configuration.",

A shorter period may result in more frequent syncs, potentially impacting system performance, while a longer period may reduce the frequency of syncs but could increase the risk of data loss in case of a failure."
