The tcpConnectTimeoutInMS() method returns the value of the configuration if it is not null, otherwise it retrieves the value from DatabaseDescriptor.getInternodeTcpConnectTimeoutInMS().",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The triggering frequency of the 'internode_tcp_connect_timeout_in_ms' configuration depends on the frequency of internode tcp connections being established in the system. If there are frequent internode tcp connections, this configuration will be triggered more often.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the 'internode_tcp_connect_timeout_in_ms' configuration option is to protect Cassandra from true network partitions by setting a timeout for internode tcp connections. If the timeout is too short, it may lead to failed connections and potential network issues. If the timeout is too long, it may delay the establishment of internode tcp connections."
