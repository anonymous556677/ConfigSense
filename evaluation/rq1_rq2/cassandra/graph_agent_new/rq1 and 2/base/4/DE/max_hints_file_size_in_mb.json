    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The configuration code 'max_hints_file_size_in_mb' is used to set the maximum size for a single hints file in megabytes. In the provided code snippet, the value of 'maxHintsFileSize' is retrieved using 'DatabaseDescriptor.getMaxHintsFileSize()' and is used to check the size of the hints file being written to. If the size exceeds the configured maximum size, the writing process is stopped.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The triggering frequency of the 'max_hints_file_size_in_mb' configuration depends on how often hints files are being written in the system. If hints files are being written frequently and the size of the files approaches or exceeds the configured maximum size, the configuration will be triggered more often.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the 'max_hints_file_size_in_mb' configuration option on the system is that it helps in controlling the size of hints files generated by the system. By setting a maximum size limit, it prevents hints files from growing too large and potentially causing issues such as disk space exhaustion or performance degradation."
