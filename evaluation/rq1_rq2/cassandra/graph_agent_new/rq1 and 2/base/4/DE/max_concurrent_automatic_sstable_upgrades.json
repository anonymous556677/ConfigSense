    "config_description": "Automatically upgrade sstables after upgrade - if there is no ordinary compaction to do, the oldest non-upgraded sstable will get upgraded to the latest version automatic_sstable_upgrade: false Limit the number of concurrent sstable upgrades",
    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The configuration 'max_concurrent_automatic_sstable_upgrades' controls the maximum number of concurrent sstable upgrade tasks that can run automatically. The code checks if the number of currently running upgrade tasks is less than or equal to the configured maximum before starting a new upgrade task.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The configuration is triggered whenever the 'maybeRunUpgradeTask' method is called, which typically happens when there is no ordinary compaction to do and the system needs to upgrade the oldest non-upgraded sstable. The frequency of triggering depends on the workload and the availability of upgrade tasks.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the 'max_concurrent_automatic_sstable_upgrades' configuration option on the system is that it limits the number of concurrent sstable upgrades that can run automatically. Setting this value too low may result in slower upgrade processes, while setting it too high may overload the system with upgrade tasks. It is important to find a balance based on the system's capacity and workload."
