    "config_description": "enable or disable keepalive on rpc/native connections",
    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The rpc_keepalive configuration in the code determines whether keepalive on rpc/native connections is enabled or disabled. It is used to control the behavior of the connections in terms of keeping them alive or closing them after a certain period of inactivity.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The triggering frequency of the rpc_keepalive configuration depends on the specific use case and workload of the system. If keepalive is enabled, the connections will be kept alive for a longer period, potentially reducing the overhead of establishing new connections. If keepalive is disabled, connections may be closed more frequently, leading to potentially higher connection establishment overhead.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the rpc_keepalive configuration option on the system is related to the performance and resource utilization of the system. Enabling keepalive may improve performance by reducing connection establishment overhead and potentially improving latency. However, it may also consume more resources to keep connections alive. Disabling keepalive may lead to more frequent connection establishment overhead but may save resources by closing connections sooner."
