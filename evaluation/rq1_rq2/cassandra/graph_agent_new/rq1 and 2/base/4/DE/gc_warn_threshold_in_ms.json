    "config_description": "GC Pauses greater than gc_warn_threshold_in_ms will be logged at WARN level Adjust the threshold based on your application throughput requirement. Setting to 0 will deactivate the feature.",
    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The gc_warn_threshold_in_ms configuration is used to set a threshold for logging GC pauses at WARN level. If the GC pause time exceeds the specified threshold, a warning message will be logged. This allows developers to monitor and adjust GC behavior based on application throughput requirements.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The triggering frequency of the gc_warn_threshold_in_ms configuration depends on the GC behavior of the system and the specified threshold. If the GC pause time exceeds the threshold, the configuration will be triggered and a warning message will be logged. The frequency of triggering will vary based on the workload and GC behavior of the system.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the gc_warn_threshold_in_ms configuration option is on the system's monitoring and logging behavior. Setting a higher threshold may result in fewer warning messages being logged, while setting a lower threshold may increase the frequency of warnings. Developers need to carefully adjust the threshold based on the application's throughput requirements to balance monitoring needs with system performance."
