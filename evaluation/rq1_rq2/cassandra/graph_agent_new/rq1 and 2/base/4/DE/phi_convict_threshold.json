    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The phi_convict_threshold configuration is used in the code to determine the phi value that must be reached for a host to be marked down. It is used in the convict method to check if the phi value is greater than 2 times the phi_convict_threshold before marking a host as down.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The triggering frequency of the phi_convict_threshold configuration depends on the failure detection mechanism and the frequency of phi calculations in the system. It is triggered whenever the phi value for a host is calculated and compared to the phi_convict_threshold.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the phi_convict_threshold configuration option is significant as it determines when a host is marked down in the system. Setting it too low may result in hosts being marked down prematurely, affecting system availability. Setting it too high may delay the detection of failed hosts, impacting system reliability."
