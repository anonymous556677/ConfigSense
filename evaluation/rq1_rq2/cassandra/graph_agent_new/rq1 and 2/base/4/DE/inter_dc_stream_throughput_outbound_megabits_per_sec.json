    "config_description": "Throttles all streaming file transfer between the datacenters, this setting allows users to throttle inter dc stream throughput in addition to throttling all network stream traffic as configured with stream_throughput_outbound_megabits_per_sec When unset, the default is 200 Mbps or 25 MB/s",
    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The configuration 'inter_dc_stream_throughput_outbound_megabits_per_sec' is used to throttle all streaming file transfer between datacenters. It allows users to set a limit on the inter-DC stream throughput. The code provided includes methods to set and get the value of this configuration, as well as a method to calculate the inter-DC rate in bytes based on the configured throughput value.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The triggering frequency of the 'inter_dc_stream_throughput_outbound_megabits_per_sec' configuration depends on when the setInterDCStreamThroughputMbPerSec method is called by the system. This could vary based on user input or system events that require adjusting the inter-DC stream throughput.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the 'inter_dc_stream_throughput_outbound_megabits_per_sec' configuration option is that it controls the rate at which data is transferred between datacenters. Setting a lower value can limit the inter-DC stream throughput, potentially affecting the speed of data transfer between datacenters. On the other hand, setting a higher value can increase the throughput but may also lead to network congestion and resource utilization."
