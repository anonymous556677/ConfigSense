    "config_description": "Maximum size of the counter cache in memory.  Counter cache helps to reduce counter locks' contention for hot counter cells. In case of RF = 1 a counter cache hit will cause Cassandra to skip the read before write entirely. With RF > 1 a counter cache hit will still help to reduce the duration of the lock hold, helping with hot counter cell updates, but will not allow skipping the read entirely. Only the local (clock, count) tuple of a counter cell is kept in memory, not the whole counter, so it's relatively cheap.  NOTE: if you reduce the size, you may not get you hottest keys loaded on startup.  Default value is empty to make it \"auto\" (min(2.5% of Heap (in MB), 50MB)). Set to 0 to disable counter cache. NOTE: if you perform counter deletes and rely on low gcgs, you should disable the counter cache.",
    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The 'counter_cache_size_in_mb' configuration is used to set the maximum size of the counter cache in memory. The code initializes a counter cache with the specified capacity in MBs. The cache is scheduled to save keys periodically based on the configured save period.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The 'counter_cache_size_in_mb' configuration is triggered when the counter cache is initialized. The cache save is scheduled to occur at a frequency specified by the 'counterCacheSavePeriod' configuration.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the 'counter_cache_size_in_mb' configuration option is significant as it determines the maximum size of the counter cache in memory. Setting a larger size can improve performance by reducing contention for hot counter cells and potentially skipping read operations. However, setting a smaller size may result in not loading all the hottest keys on startup. Disabling the counter cache can be beneficial in certain scenarios such as when performing counter deletes and relying on low gcgs."
