The faster you insert data, the faster you need to compact in order to keep the sstable count down, but in general, setting this to 16 to 32 times the rate you are inserting data is more than sufficient. Setting this to 0 disables throttling. Note that this accounts for all types of compaction, including validation compaction (building Merkle trees for repairs).",

However, setting it too high may lead to resource contention and potential performance issues."
