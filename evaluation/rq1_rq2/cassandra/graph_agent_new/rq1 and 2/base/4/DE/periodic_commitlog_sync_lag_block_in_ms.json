    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The 'periodic_commitlog_sync_lag_block_in_ms' configuration is used to determine the number of milliseconds to block writes while waiting for a slow disk flush to complete in periodic commitlog mode. The configuration value is converted to nanoseconds and used to calculate the expected sync time for the commit log segment.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The triggering frequency of the 'periodic_commitlog_sync_lag_block_in_ms' configuration depends on the frequency of slow disk flushes during periodic commitlog mode. It is triggered whenever a slow disk flush is detected and the expected sync time is greater than the last synced time.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the 'periodic_commitlog_sync_lag_block_in_ms' configuration option on the system is that it can potentially block writes for the specified number of milliseconds, affecting the overall performance of write operations during slow disk flushes. It helps in ensuring data consistency by waiting for the flush to complete before proceeding with further writes."
