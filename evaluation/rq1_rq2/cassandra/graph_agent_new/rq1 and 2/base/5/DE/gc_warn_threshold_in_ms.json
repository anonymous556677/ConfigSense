    "config_description": "GC Pauses greater than gc_warn_threshold_in_ms will be logged at WARN level Adjust the threshold based on your application throughput requirement. Setting to 0 will deactivate the feature.",
    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The configuration 'gc_warn_threshold_in_ms' is used to set a threshold for logging GC pauses at WARN level. If the GC pauses exceed the specified threshold, a warning message will be logged. The configuration allows developers to adjust the threshold based on the application's throughput requirement.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The configuration is triggered whenever a Garbage Collection event occurs and the pause time exceeds the specified threshold value of 'gc_warn_threshold_in_ms'. The frequency of triggering depends on the frequency of GC events and the duration of the pauses.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the 'gc_warn_threshold_in_ms' configuration option on the system is that it affects the logging behavior of GC pauses. Setting a higher threshold may result in fewer warning messages being logged, potentially missing important information about GC performance issues. On the other hand, setting a lower threshold may result in more frequent warning messages, which could impact system performance and increase log file size."
