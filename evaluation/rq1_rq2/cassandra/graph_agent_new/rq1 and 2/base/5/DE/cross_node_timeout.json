If disabled, replicas will assume that requests were forwarded to them instantly by the coordinator, which means that under overload conditions we will waste that much extra time processing already-timed-out requests.  Warning: It is generally assumed that users have setup NTP on their clusters, and that clocks are modestly in sync, since this is a requirement for general correctness of last write wins.",
    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The 'cross_node_timeout' configuration is checked in the code to determine whether operation timeout information exchange between nodes should be enabled. If the configuration is enabled and the creation time is greater than the current time, the creation time is set to the current time. The function then calculates and returns the expiration time based on the creation time and expiration period.",

If the configuration is disabled, replicas will assume that requests were forwarded instantly, potentially leading to wasted time processing already-timed-out requests under overload conditions. It is important to note that this configuration assumes that users have set up NTP and have synchronized clocks for general correctness of last write wins."
