It provides a way to throttle the links created during snapshot operations to avoid performance impact, especially on consumer grade SSDs. The configuration setting allows users to control the rate at which snapshot links are created, thus managing performance impact."

A non-zero value can help in managing the performance impact of taking and clearing snapshots."
