So a small total commitlog space will tend to cause more flush activity on less-active columnfamilies.  The default value is the smaller of 8192, and 1/4 of the total space of the commitlog volume. ",
    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The 'commitlog_total_space_in_mb' configuration determines the total space to use for commit logs on disk in Cassandra. The code snippet provided calculates the unused capacity by subtracting the current size of the commit log from the total space allocated for commit logs.",

When the current size approaches the total space allocated, Cassandra will flush every dirty column family in the oldest segment and remove it to free up space.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the 'commitlog_total_space_in_mb' configuration is significant as it directly affects the amount of space available for commit logs. A smaller total commit log space will result in more frequent flush activity on less-active column families, potentially impacting the performance of the system."
