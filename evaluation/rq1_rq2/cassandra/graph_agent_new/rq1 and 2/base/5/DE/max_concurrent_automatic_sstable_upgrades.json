    "config_description": "Automatically upgrade sstables after upgrade - if there is no ordinary compaction to do, the oldest non-upgraded sstable will get upgraded to the latest version automatic_sstable_upgrade: false Limit the number of concurrent sstable upgrades",
    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The configuration 'max_concurrent_automatic_sstable_upgrades' controls the maximum number of concurrent sstable upgrades that can be automatically triggered after an upgrade. The code snippet shows a method 'maybeRunUpgradeTask' that checks if there are upgrade tasks available and if the number of currently running background upgrades is less than or equal to the configured maximum concurrent auto upgrade tasks. If so, it finds an upgrade task and executes it.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The triggering frequency of the 'max_concurrent_automatic_sstable_upgrades' configuration depends on the availability of upgrade tasks and the number of currently running background upgrades. It is triggered whenever the system checks for upgrade tasks and the conditions for running an upgrade task are met.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the 'max_concurrent_automatic_sstable_upgrades' configuration option is that it limits the number of concurrent sstable upgrades that can be automatically triggered after an upgrade. This helps in controlling the system resources used for sstable upgrades and prevents potential resource contention issues that may arise from running too many upgrades simultaneously."
