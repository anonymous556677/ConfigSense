The amount of time to wait for internode tcp connections to establish. internode_tcp_connect_timeout_in_ms: 2000  The amount of time unacknowledged data is allowed on a connection before we throw out the connection Note this is only supported on Linux + epoll, and it appears to behave oddly above a setting of 30000 (it takes much longer than 30s) as of Linux 4.12. If you want something that high set this to 0 which picks up the OS default and configure the net.ipv4.tcp_retries2 sysctl to be ~8.",
    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The configuration option internode_tcp_user_timeout_in_ms is used to set the amount of time to wait for internode TCP connections to establish in Cassandra. The code snippet provided shows that the tcpUserTimeoutInMS method is used to determine the timeout value based on the connection category (messaging or streaming). If a specific timeout value is not set, it falls back to using the value from DatabaseDescriptor.getInternodeTcpUserTimeoutInMS() method.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The triggering frequency of the internode_tcp_user_timeout_in_ms configuration in the system depends on the frequency of establishing internode TCP connections in Cassandra. The configuration will be triggered whenever a new internode TCP connection is being established, either for messaging or streaming purposes.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the internode_tcp_user_timeout_in_ms configuration option is crucial for protecting Cassandra from true network partitions. By setting an appropriate timeout value, it helps in managing the establishment of internode TCP connections effectively. Setting a too low or too high value can impact the performance and reliability of the system. It is recommended to follow the defensive settings mentioned in the configuration description to ensure the proper functioning of Cassandra."
