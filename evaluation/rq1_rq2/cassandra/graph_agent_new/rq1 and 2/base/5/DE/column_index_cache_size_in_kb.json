    "config_description": "Per sstable indexed key cache entries (the collation index in memory mentioned above) exceeding this size will not be held on heap. This means that only partition information is held on heap and the index entries are read from disk.  Note that this size refers to the size of the serialized index information and not the size of the partition.",
    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The configuration 'column_index_cache_size_in_kb' is used to determine the size limit for sstable indexed key cache entries. If the entries exceed this size, they will not be held in heap memory and will be read from disk instead. This ensures that only partition information is held in heap memory.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The configuration is triggered whenever the sstable indexed key cache entries exceed the specified size limit. This triggering frequency depends on the amount of index information being stored and accessed in the system.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the 'column_index_cache_size_in_kb' configuration option is that it affects the memory usage of the system. By setting a limit on the size of index entries held in memory, it helps manage memory usage and prevents excessive memory consumption. However, if the size limit is too low, it may result in more frequent disk reads, potentially impacting performance."
