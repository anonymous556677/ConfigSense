    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The configuration 'stream_throughput_outbound_megabits_per_sec' controls the outbound stream throughput in megabits per second for streaming file transfers between datacenters. The setStreamThroughputMbPerSec method sets the value of the throughput, the getStreamThroughputMbPerSec method retrieves the current value, and the calculateRateInBytes method calculates the rate in bytes based on the configured throughput.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The configuration is triggered whenever the setStreamThroughputMbPerSec method is called to update the throughput value. The frequency of triggering depends on how often this method is invoked by the system or users.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the configuration option is significant as it directly affects the rate at which streaming file transfers occur between datacenters. Setting a lower throughput value can limit the speed of transfers, while setting a higher value can increase the speed. Throttling the stream throughput can help manage network traffic and prevent overload on the system."
