    "config_description": "Global, per-endpoint and per-connection limits imposed on messages queued for delivery to other nodes and waiting to be processed on arrival from other nodes in the cluster.  These limits are applied to the on-wire size of the message being sent or received.  The basic per-link limit is consumed in isolation before any endpoint or global limit is imposed. Each node-pair has three links: urgent, small and large.  So any given node may have a maximum of N*3*(internode_application_send_queue_capacity_in_bytes+internode_application_receive_queue_capacity_in_bytes) messages queued without any coordination between them although in practice, with token-aware routing, only RF*tokens nodes should need to communicate with significant bandwidth.  The per-endpoint limit is imposed on all messages exceeding the per-link limit, simultaneously with the global limit, on all links to or from a single node in the cluster. The global limit is imposed on all messages exceeding the per-link limit, simultaneously with the per-endpoint limit, on all links to or from any node in the cluster.  internode_application_send_queue_capacity_in_bytes: 4194304                       #4MiB internode_application_send_queue_reserve_endpoint_capacity_in_bytes: 134217728    #128MiB",
    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The configuration 'internode_application_send_queue_reserve_global_capacity_in_bytes' is used to set global, per-endpoint, and per-connection limits on messages queued for delivery to other nodes and waiting to be processed on arrival from other nodes in the cluster. These limits are applied to the on-wire size of the message being sent or received. The configuration is used to control the amount of queued messages and manage the message processing within the cluster.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The configuration is triggered when messages exceed the per-link limit, either on a per-endpoint basis or globally. The triggering frequency depends on the message traffic and the size of the queued messages. It is not triggered at regular intervals but rather based on the message processing and queuing within the cluster.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the 'internode_application_send_queue_reserve_global_capacity_in_bytes' configuration option is significant as it directly affects the message queuing and processing within the cluster. Setting a higher value for this configuration can increase the amount of queued messages and potentially lead to increased memory usage and processing overhead. Conversely, setting a lower value can limit the message queue size but may also impact the message delivery and processing speed within the cluster."
