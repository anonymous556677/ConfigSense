    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The configuration 'internode_tcp_connect_timeout_in_ms' is used to set the amount of time to wait for internode tcp connections to establish in Cassandra. The code snippet provided shows that the method tcpConnectTimeoutInMS() returns the value of 'tcpConnectTimeoutInMS' if it is not null, otherwise it calls getInternodeTcpConnectTimeoutInMS() method from DatabaseDescriptor to get the value.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The triggering frequency of the 'internode_tcp_connect_timeout_in_ms' configuration depends on the network conditions and the frequency of internode tcp connections in the system. It is typically triggered when establishing internode tcp connections.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the 'internode_tcp_connect_timeout_in_ms' configuration option is that it helps in protecting Cassandra from true network partitions by setting a timeout for internode tcp connections. If the timeout is too short, it may lead to connection failures and potential network issues. If the timeout is too long, it may delay the connection establishment process."
