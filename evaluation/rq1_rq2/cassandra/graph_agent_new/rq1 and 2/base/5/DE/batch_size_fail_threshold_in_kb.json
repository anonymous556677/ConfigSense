It retrieves the value from the configuration and returns it. The configuration setting defines the threshold at which a multiple-partition batch will fail, with the default value being 50kb."

    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The configuration 'batch_size_fail_threshold_in_kb' is used to determine the maximum size in kilobytes for a multiple-partition batch before it is considered a failure. The code snippet provided retrieves this value from the DatabaseDescriptor.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The triggering frequency of the 'batch_size_fail_threshold_in_kb' configuration depends on the batch operations being performed in the system. If large multiple-partition batches are frequently processed, this configuration may be triggered more often.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the 'batch_size_fail_threshold_in_kb' configuration option on the system is that it helps in preventing large multiple-partition batches from causing performance issues or failures. By setting a threshold, the system can avoid processing batches that exceed a certain size, which can help in maintaining system stability and performance."
