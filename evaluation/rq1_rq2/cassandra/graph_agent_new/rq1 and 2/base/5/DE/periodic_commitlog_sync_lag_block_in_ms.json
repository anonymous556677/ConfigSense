    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The configuration 'periodic_commitlog_sync_lag_block_in_ms' is used in the code to determine the number of milliseconds to block writes while waiting for a slow disk flush to complete in periodic commitlog mode. It calculates the expected sync time based on the current time and the configured block time when sync lags.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The triggering frequency of the 'periodic_commitlog_sync_lag_block_in_ms' configuration depends on the system's performance and the frequency of slow disk flushes. It is triggered whenever a slow disk flush occurs and the system needs to block writes temporarily.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the 'periodic_commitlog_sync_lag_block_in_ms' configuration option on the system is that it can affect the overall performance and throughput of the system. If the configured block time is too long, it may cause delays in write operations, but if it is too short, it may not provide enough time for slow disk flushes to complete, potentially leading to data loss or corruption."
