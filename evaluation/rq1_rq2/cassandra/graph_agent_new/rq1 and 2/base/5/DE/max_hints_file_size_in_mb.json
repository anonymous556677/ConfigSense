    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The configuration 'max_hints_file_size_in_mb' is used in the code to determine the maximum size for a single hints file in megabytes. It is retrieved using DatabaseDescriptor.getMaxHintsFileSize() and is used to check the session position while appending data to the hints file.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The configuration is triggered whenever the flushInternal method is called with an iterator and HintsStore as parameters. The frequency of triggering depends on how often the flushInternal method is invoked in the system.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the 'max_hints_file_size_in_mb' configuration option is that it limits the size of individual hints files. If the size of the hints file exceeds the configured maximum size, the session will stop appending data to the file, which can prevent the file from growing too large and potentially causing issues with storage or performance."
