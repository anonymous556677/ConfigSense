The faster you insert data, the faster you need to compact in order to keep the sstable count down, but in general, setting this to 16 to 32 times the rate you are inserting data is more than sufficient. Setting this to 0 disables throttling. Note that this accounts for all types of compaction, including validation compaction (building Merkle trees for repairs).",
    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The configuration 'compaction_throughput_mb_per_sec' is used to throttle compaction to a specific throughput limit across the entire system. It sets the rate limiter for compaction based on the value obtained from DatabaseDescriptor.getCompactionThroughputMbPerSec().",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The triggering frequency of the 'compaction_throughput_mb_per_sec' configuration depends on the rate at which data is inserted into the system. The faster data is inserted, the more frequent compaction will be triggered to keep the sstable count down.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the 'compaction_throughput_mb_per_sec' configuration is significant in managing the compaction process in the system. Setting the value appropriately ensures efficient compaction to maintain sstable count and overall system performance. Setting it too low may lead to compaction not keeping up with data insertion rate, while setting it too high may consume unnecessary resources for compaction."
