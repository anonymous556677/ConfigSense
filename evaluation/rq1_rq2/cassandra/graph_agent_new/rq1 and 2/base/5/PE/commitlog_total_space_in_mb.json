    "Reason": "The 'commitlog_total_space_in_mb' configuration is performance-sensitive. The code snippet provided directly calculates the unused capacity based on the total commit log space allocated and the current size. This configuration directly impacts the system performance by determining the available space for commit logs. A smaller total commit log space can lead to more frequent flush activities, potentially impacting the system's performance. Therefore, the configuration involves performance-related operations that are time-expensive and memory-expensive, leading to notable performance variations at the system level."
