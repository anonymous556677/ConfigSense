    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'diagnostic_events_enabled' configuration is performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly impacts the system's performance by controlling whether diagnostic events are enabled or not. The code context shows that the configuration is checked in multiple methods like 'isEnabled' and 'isDiagnosticsEnabled' to determine if events should be published. Enabling diagnostic events can introduce overhead in terms of processing and memory usage, leading to notable performance variations at the system level."
