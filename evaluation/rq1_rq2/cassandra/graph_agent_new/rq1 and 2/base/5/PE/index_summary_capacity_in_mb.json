    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'index_summary_capacity_in_mb' is performance-sensitive. The code context shows that this configuration is directly used to set the memory pool size for SSTable index summaries, which can have a significant impact on memory consumption at the system level. The configuration involves setting a fixed memory pool size in MB, which can lead to notable performance variations depending on the memory usage of index summaries. Additionally, the developer's explanation highlights that exceeding the configured limit may result in Cassandra needing to use more memory than expected, further emphasizing the performance sensitivity of this configuration."
