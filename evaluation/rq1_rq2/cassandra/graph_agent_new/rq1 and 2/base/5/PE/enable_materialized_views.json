    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'enable_materialized_views' is performance-sensitive. The code context shows that the configuration directly impacts the system performance by checking if materialized views are enabled. Enabling materialized views can have a significant impact on system resources and performance, as indicated by the developer's understanding. The configuration involves multiple performance-related operations such as dependency validations, processing SELECT clause, processing PRIMARY KEY columns, and WHERE clause, which are time-expensive and memory-expensive. Therefore, the configuration is considered performance-sensitive based on its direct and substantial effect on system performance at the system level."
