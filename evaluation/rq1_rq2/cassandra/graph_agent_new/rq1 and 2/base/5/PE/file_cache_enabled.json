    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'file_cache_enabled' configuration is performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly impacts the system's performance by enabling or disabling the sstable chunk cache based on the 'fileCacheEnabled' flag and the cache size. The code snippet shows that when 'fileCacheEnabled' is set to true and the cache size is greater than 0, the cache is enabled, which affects memory consumption and read performance. Enabling the cache stores recently accessed sections of the sstable in-memory, reducing the need to read data from disk repeatedly, thus leading to notable performance variations at the system level."
