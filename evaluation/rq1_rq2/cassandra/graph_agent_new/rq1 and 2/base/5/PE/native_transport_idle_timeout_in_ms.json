    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'native_transport_idle_timeout_in_ms' configuration is performance-sensitive. The configuration directly impacts system performance by controlling when idle client connections are closed, which can affect resource utilization and connection management. The code snippet provided adds an IdleStateHandler to the channel's pipeline with the idle timeout value obtained from DatabaseDescriptor.nativeTransportIdleTimeout(). This operation is time-expensive as it involves monitoring and closing idle connections, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
