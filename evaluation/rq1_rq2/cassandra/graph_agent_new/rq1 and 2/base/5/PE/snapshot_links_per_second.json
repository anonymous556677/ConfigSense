    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'snapshot_links_per_second' is performance-sensitive. The code context shows that the configuration is directly used to create a RateLimiter object, which can have a notable performance impact on the system level. The developer's explanation also highlights that the configuration is used to throttle the creation or clearing of snapshot links to avoid negative performance impact on consumer grade SSDs. Additionally, the method 'getSnapshotLinksPerSecond' involves performance-related operations by checking and returning the value of the configuration setting, which can contribute to execution time. Therefore, the configuration involves time-extensive operations that can lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
