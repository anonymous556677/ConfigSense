    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'streaming_keep_alive_period_in_secs' is performance-sensitive. This is because the value of this configuration directly affects the frequency at which keep-alive messages are sent between nodes during streaming sessions. A shorter period results in more frequent messages being sent, potentially increasing network traffic and system load. On the other hand, a longer period may lead to session timeouts and failures if keep-alive messages are not received in time. The code context provided shows that the configuration value is used to schedule keep-alive tasks at a fixed rate, which directly impacts system performance by affecting network traffic and session stability."
