    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'cdc_free_space_check_interval_ms' is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the configuration directly impacts the system's performance by determining the interval at which the system checks for available space for cdc-tracked tables in the cdc_raw directory. This interval affects the frequency of performance-related operations such as disk space checks, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The code context includes operations like size tracking, segment creation, and disk space calculations, all of which are time-expensive and memory-expensive, contributing to the performance sensitivity of the configuration."
