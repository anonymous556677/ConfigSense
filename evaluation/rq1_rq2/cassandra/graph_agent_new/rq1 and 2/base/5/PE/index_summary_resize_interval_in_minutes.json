    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'index_summary_resize_interval_in_minutes' is performance-sensitive. This is because the value of this configuration directly impacts how frequently index summaries are resampled, which in turn affects the redistribution of memory from a fixed-size pool to sstables based on their read rates. The resampling process triggered by this configuration involves memory-expensive operations that can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Therefore, any changes to this configuration can have a significant impact on system performance."
