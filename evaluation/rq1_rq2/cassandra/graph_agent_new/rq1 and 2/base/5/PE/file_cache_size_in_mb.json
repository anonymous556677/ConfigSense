    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'file_cache_size_in_mb' configuration is performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly determines the maximum memory allocated for sstable chunk cache and buffer pooling in the system, impacting the system's performance and memory usage. The calculation of the cache size based on the value obtained from 'DatabaseDescriptor.getFileCacheSizeInMB()' and the subsequent adjustments made in the ChunkCache class show that this configuration has a significant impact on the system level performance, making it performance-sensitive."
