    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'cross_node_timeout' configuration is performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly impacts the handling of operation timeouts between nodes, which can have a significant effect on system performance. The code snippet provided shows that if the 'cross_node_timeout' configuration is enabled, it affects the calculation of expiration time based on the creation time and expiration period. This operation is time-expensive and can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, especially in scenarios where there are frequent interactions between nodes. Additionally, the 'hasCrossNodeTimeout' method, which is related to this configuration, directly influences timeout handling in the system, further emphasizing its performance sensitivity."
