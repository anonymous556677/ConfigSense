    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'tracetype_query_ttl' is performance-sensitive. The 'tracetype_query_ttl' configuration directly affects the TTL (Time to Live) for different trace types during the logging of the repair process. This configuration involves performance-related operations such as setting and accessing TTL values based on the ordinal value of the TraceType enum. The TTL value can impact the storage size and performance of the system by affecting the storage space required for trace data and the retention period of trace data. Therefore, the 'tracetype_query_ttl' configuration is considered performance-sensitive as it directly and substantially affects system performance at the system level."
