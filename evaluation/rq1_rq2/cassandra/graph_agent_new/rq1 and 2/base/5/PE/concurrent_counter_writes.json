    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'concurrent_counter_writes' configuration is classified as performance-sensitive. This classification is based on the fact that the configuration directly influences the number of concurrent counter writers and the acquisition of striped cell-level locks in the CounterMutation class. These locks are essential for ensuring proper ordering of counter updates and preventing conflicts, which are critical for system performance. The configuration's impact on concurrency and performance of counter writes at the system level makes it performance-sensitive."
