    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'num_tokens' configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the distribution of data across the cluster, affecting the system's overall performance. The code related to the configuration involves operations that check the number of tokens, allocate tokens, and validate the replication factor, all of which are time-expensive and memory-expensive operations. Changing the number of tokens can lead to notable performance variations at the system level due to the way data is distributed and replicated. Therefore, the configuration is considered performance-sensitive."
