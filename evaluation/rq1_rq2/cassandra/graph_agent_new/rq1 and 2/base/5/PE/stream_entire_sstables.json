    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'stream_entire_sstables' is performance-sensitive. The code context provided shows that this configuration directly impacts the decision to stream entire SSTables based on certain conditions related to full sstable transfers and legacy counter shards. Enabling this configuration can significantly speed up network transfer and reduce GC pressure, but it may also impact disk balance and be automatically disabled under certain conditions. These performance-related operations within the code can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, making it a performance-sensitive configuration."
