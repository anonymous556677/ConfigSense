    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'dynamic_snitch_badness_threshold' configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly affects the behavior of the dynamic snitch algorithm, which plays a crucial role in selecting replicas based on their performance. By adjusting the badness threshold, the dynamic snitch can prioritize better-performing replicas over poorly-performing ones, leading to notable performance variations at the system level. The configuration-related code contains operations that update the dynamic snitch parameters based on the DatabaseDescriptor values, which are time-expensive and memory-expensive operations. Therefore, any changes to the 'dynamic_snitch_badness_threshold' configuration can have a significant impact on system performance, making it performance-sensitive."
