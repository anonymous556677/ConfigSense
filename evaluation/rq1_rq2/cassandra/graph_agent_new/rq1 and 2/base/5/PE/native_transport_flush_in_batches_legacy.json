{
    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'native_transport_flush_in_batches_legacy' is classified as performance-sensitive. This is because enabling this configuration directly affects the system performance by improving throughput, especially for systems with older kernels or fewer client connections. The code context shows that this configuration is used during the initialization of the Server class, specifically in the 'pipelineConfigurator' initialization. The method 'useNativeTransportLegacyFlusher()' checks the value of this configuration parameter and returns it, indicating that it has a direct impact on system performance at the system level."
