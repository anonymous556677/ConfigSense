    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option internode_application_send_queue_reserve_endpoint_capacity_in_bytes is performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly impacts the per-endpoint limit for messages queued for delivery to other nodes, which can affect the system's memory usage and network bandwidth. The code context shows that the configuration is used to set the applicationReserveSendQueueEndpointCapacityInBytes in the OutboundConnectionSettings class, indicating that it plays a crucial role in managing message queue size and preventing system overload. Therefore, any changes to this configuration can lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
