    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'repair_session_space_in_mb' configuration is classified as performance-sensitive. This classification is based on the fact that the configuration directly impacts memory usage during repair operations, as it determines the available space for holding RF trees in memory. The calculation of available bytes in the code snippet is directly tied to this configuration, and any changes to the 'repair_session_space_in_mb' value can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Adjusting this configuration can significantly affect the memory consumption and overall performance of the system during repair sessions."
