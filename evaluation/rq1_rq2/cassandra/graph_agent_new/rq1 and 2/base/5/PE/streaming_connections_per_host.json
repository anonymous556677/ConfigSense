    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'streaming_connections_per_host' configuration is performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly affects the number of connections per host for streaming operations, which can have a significant impact on system performance. The code snippet shows that this configuration is used in the RangeStreamer constructor, which is a critical component for streaming data during bootstrap and rebuild processes. Adjusting this configuration can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, especially in scenarios where streaming operations are crucial for data transfer and synchronization between nodes. Additionally, the developer's understanding that increasing the number of connections per host can potentially optimize streaming operations further supports the classification of this configuration as performance-sensitive."
