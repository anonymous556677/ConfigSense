    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'concurrent_materialized_view_writes' configuration is classified as performance-sensitive. The configuration directly impacts system performance by managing materialized views for a single ColumnFamilyStore. The code context reveals that the configuration involves time-expensive operations such as acquiring locks to prevent incoherent updates and affecting changes on the view. These operations can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, making the configuration performance-sensitive."
