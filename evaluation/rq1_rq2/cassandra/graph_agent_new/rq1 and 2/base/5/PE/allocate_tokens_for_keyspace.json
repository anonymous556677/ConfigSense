    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'allocate_tokens_for_keyspace' configuration is performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly impacts the token allocation algorithm, which in turn affects the distribution of data across the cluster. The code snippet shows that the configuration can lead to notable performance variations at the system level based on the token allocation logic implemented. The allocation of tokens is a time-expensive operation that can significantly impact the performance and load balancing of the system, making this configuration performance-sensitive."
