    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The configuration option internode_tcp_user_timeout_in_ms is not considered performance-sensitive based on the provided code context and developer information. The code snippet shows that the configuration is used to set the timeout value for internode TCP connections based on the connection category (messaging or streaming). The method simply returns the timeout value from DatabaseDescriptor, and there are no complex or time-expensive operations involved in calculating the timeout value. Additionally, the developer's understanding emphasizes the importance of setting an appropriate timeout value for managing internode TCP connections effectively, rather than focusing on performance optimization. Therefore, the configuration does not directly and substantially affect system performance at the system level to be classified as performance-sensitive."
