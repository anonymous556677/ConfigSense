    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'native_transport_max_frame_size_in_mb' configuration is performance-sensitive. This is because the maximum frame size directly impacts the processing of message envelopes in the system. If the frame size exceeds the configured limit, it can lead to rejection of frames as invalid, affecting the overall system performance. The configuration is checked and enforced in the code during the encoding and decoding of message envelopes, indicating its direct influence on system-level performance."
