    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The 'auto_snapshot' configuration option is not performance-sensitive based on the provided code context and developer's information. The configuration is related to taking a snapshot before keyspace truncation or dropping of column families for data safety purposes. The code snippets related to the 'auto_snapshot' configuration do not contain any performance-related operations that significantly impact system performance at the system level. The configuration's primary concern is data safety rather than performance optimization."
