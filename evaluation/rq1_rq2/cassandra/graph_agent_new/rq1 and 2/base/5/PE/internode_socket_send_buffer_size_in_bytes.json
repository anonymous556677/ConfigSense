    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'internode_socket_send_buffer_size_in_bytes' is classified as performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly impacts the buffer size for internode communication, which can significantly affect the efficiency and performance of internode communication in the system. The code context shows that the configuration is accessed through the method socketSendBufferSizeInBytes(), which retrieves the value either from the configuration itself or from DatabaseDescriptor.getInternodeSocketSendBufferSizeInBytes(). This indicates that the configuration is crucial for determining the buffer size used in internode communication, making it performance-sensitive at the system level."
