    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'internode_streaming_tcp_user_timeout_in_ms' is classified as performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly impacts the processing time of incoming stream messages at the system level. The code snippet related to this configuration involves checking the processing latency against the configured timeout value and potentially closing the streaming connection if the processing time exceeds the timeout. This operation is time-expensive and can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, making the configuration performance-sensitive."
