{
    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'write_request_timeout_in_ms' is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the timeout value directly affects the system's performance by determining how long the coordinator should wait for write operations to complete. Setting an inappropriate timeout value can lead to performance issues such as premature timeouts or delayed detection of failed writes, impacting the overall system performance and consistency. The configuration-related code extensively uses this timeout value to set timeouts for write operations, emphasizing its performance sensitivity."
