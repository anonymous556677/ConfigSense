    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'cas_contention_timeout_in_ms' is performance-sensitive because it directly affects the system's performance at the system level by determining how long a coordinator should continue to retry CAS operations that contend with other proposals for the same row. The code context shows that this configuration is used as the timeout for retrying Paxos rounds, which are critical for ensuring the consistency of updates. The timeout value set by this configuration can lead to notable performance variations by impacting the frequency and duration of retries during contention situations, directly affecting the overall system performance."
