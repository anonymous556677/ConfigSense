    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'tombstone_warn_threshold' configuration is performance-sensitive. This is because it directly impacts the warning threshold for tombstones in Cassandra, which can affect system performance and memory consumption. The configuration is used to set a critical threshold for tombstones, and if not properly configured, it can lead to performance issues at the system level."
