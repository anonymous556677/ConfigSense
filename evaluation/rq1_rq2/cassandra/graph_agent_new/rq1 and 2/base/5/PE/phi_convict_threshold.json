    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'phi_convict_threshold' is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the 'phi_convict_threshold' directly influences the performance of the system by determining when a host should be marked down due to failure detection. The 'convict' method in the code snippet checks if the phi value is below a certain threshold before taking action, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Setting this threshold too low or too high can impact system availability and reliability, making it a performance-sensitive configuration."
