    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'counter_cache_keys_to_save' configuration is performance-sensitive. This is because the value of 'counter_cache_keys_to_save' directly impacts the number of keys saved from the counter cache during cache save operations. The code snippet shows that the value of 'counter_cache_keys_to_save' is used when submitting the write operation for the counter cache in the 'saveCaches' method. Changing this configuration can lead to notable performance variations at the system level by affecting the amount of data being saved and the storage space required for the saved keys. Therefore, the configuration is considered performance-sensitive."
