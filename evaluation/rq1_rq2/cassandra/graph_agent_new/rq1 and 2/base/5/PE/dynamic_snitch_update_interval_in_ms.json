    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'dynamic_snitch_update_interval_in_ms' is performance-sensitive because it directly affects the frequency of updating host scores, which impacts the performance of the system. The code context shows that this configuration controls the update interval and reset interval for the dynamic snitch, which are time-expensive operations. Changing the interval can lead to notable performance variations at the system level by affecting the accuracy of host scores and incurring computational overhead. Therefore, the configuration is considered performance-sensitive."
