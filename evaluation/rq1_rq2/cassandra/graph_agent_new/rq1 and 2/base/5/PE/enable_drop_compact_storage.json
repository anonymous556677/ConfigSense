{
    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'enable_drop_compact_storage' is classified as performance-sensitive. This classification is based on the fact that the configuration directly impacts the usage of 'ALTER ... DROP COMPACT STORAGE' statements on tables in the system. The code context reveals that enabling or disabling this configuration affects the storage format and performance of tables, especially those using compact storage. This can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, making it performance-sensitive. Additionally, the 'enableDropCompactStorage' method directly accesses this configuration parameter, further indicating its performance sensitivity."
