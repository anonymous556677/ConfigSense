    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'cached_rows_warn_threshold' configuration is performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly affects the behavior of the system by limiting the number of rows that can be materialized on-heap from replicas during queries. The code snippet provided shows that the configuration is used to set a threshold for warning logging when the number of rows exceeds the limit. This threshold directly impacts the execution time and memory consumption of the system, as it determines how much data needs to be processed during query resolution. Therefore, any changes to this configuration can lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
