    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'dynamic_snitch_reset_interval_in_ms' configuration option is performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly impacts the frequency at which all host scores are reset, which can have a significant effect on system performance. The code initializes and updates the DynamicEndpointSnitch with the specified intervals, which are crucial for the system's behavior. Changes in these intervals can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, making this configuration performance-sensitive."
