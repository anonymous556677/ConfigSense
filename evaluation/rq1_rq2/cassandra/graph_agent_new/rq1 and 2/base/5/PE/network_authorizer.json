    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'network_authorizer' configuration is performance-sensitive. This classification is based on the fact that the configuration directly impacts system performance at the system level by restricting user access to data centers. The code related to the 'network_authorizer' configuration includes operations that are time-expensive and memory-expensive, such as checking user permissions and roles, setting role datacenters, and authorizing user access. These operations can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, making the configuration performance-sensitive."
