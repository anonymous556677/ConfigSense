    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'start_native_transport' is classified as performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly impacts the system performance by determining whether the native transport server is started or not. Starting the native transport server enables faster and more efficient communication for clients connecting to the Cassandra cluster. The code context provided shows that the configuration involves performance-related operations such as starting the native transport server and setting flags in the StorageService instance, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
