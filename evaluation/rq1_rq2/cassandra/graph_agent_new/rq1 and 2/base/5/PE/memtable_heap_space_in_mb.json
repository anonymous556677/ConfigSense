    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'memtable_heap_space_in_mb' configuration is performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly impacts the total memory allocated for memtables in the Cassandra database, which can significantly affect the system's performance. The code snippet provided shows that the configuration is used to calculate heapLimit and offHeapLimit values, which are crucial for memory management. Setting a low limit can lead to frequent flushes and impact database performance, while setting a high limit can result in increased memory usage and potential out-of-memory errors. Therefore, any changes to this configuration can have notable performance variations at the system level."
