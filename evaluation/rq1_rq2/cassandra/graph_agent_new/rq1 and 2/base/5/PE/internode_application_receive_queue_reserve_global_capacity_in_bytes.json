    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'internode_application_receive_queue_reserve_global_capacity_in_bytes' is classified as performance-sensitive. This is because the setting directly impacts the size of messages queued for delivery between nodes in the cluster, which can have a significant effect on system performance. The code context provided shows that this configuration is related to scheduling unused connection monitoring, which suggests that it involves time-expensive operations. Additionally, the developer's explanation highlights the importance of setting this value correctly to avoid message loss or performance issues, indicating that it has a notable impact on system performance at the system level."
