    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'enable_user_defined_functions' is performance-sensitive. This is because the enableUserDefinedFunctions method directly checks the 'enable_user_defined_functions' configuration setting, and if it is not enabled, the assertUdfsEnabled method throws an InvalidRequestException, impacting the system performance. Enabling or disabling user-defined functions can have a significant impact on system functionality and potentially introduce security risks, making it a performance-sensitive configuration."
