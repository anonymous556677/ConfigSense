    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'sstable_preemptive_open_interval_in_mb' is performance-sensitive. The code context shows that this configuration directly affects the calculation of the open interval for replacement sstables during compaction. The method 'calculateOpenInterval' uses this configuration to determine the interval, which is crucial for the compaction process. The developer's understanding also highlights the importance of this configuration in optimizing the compaction process and improving read performance by reducing page cache churn and keeping hot rows hot. Therefore, the configuration's impact on system performance is significant, making it performance-sensitive."
