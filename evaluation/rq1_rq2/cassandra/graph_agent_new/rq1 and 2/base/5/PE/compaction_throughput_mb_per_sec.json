{
    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'compaction_throughput_mb_per_sec' is performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly affects the rate limiter for compaction operations across the entire system, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The code context shows that the configuration is used to set the rate limiter for compaction, which is a time-expensive operation. Additionally, the developer's understanding highlights the significant impact of this configuration on managing the compaction process efficiently to maintain overall system performance. Therefore, the configuration is considered performance-sensitive based on its direct and substantial impact on system performance."
