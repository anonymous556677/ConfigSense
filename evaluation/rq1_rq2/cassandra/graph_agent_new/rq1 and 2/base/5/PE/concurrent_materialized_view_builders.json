    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'concurrent_materialized_view_builders' configuration is performance-sensitive. This is because it directly affects the number of simultaneous materialized view builder tasks that can run, which can impact system performance by influencing the workload distribution and resource consumption. The configuration-related code in the CompactionManager class manages this configuration and sets the value based on the system's capacity and workload, indicating its significance in controlling system performance."
