    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'tombstone_failure_threshold' is performance-sensitive. This is because the threshold set by this configuration directly impacts the system performance by determining when a 'TombstoneOverwhelmingException' is thrown due to exceeding the tombstone failure threshold. The 'getTombstoneFailureThreshold()' method is called to retrieve this value, and if the number of tombstones exceeds this threshold, it can affect the execution of read commands and potentially lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
