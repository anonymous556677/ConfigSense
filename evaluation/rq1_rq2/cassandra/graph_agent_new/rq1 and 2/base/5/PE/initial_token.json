    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'initial_token' configuration option is classified as performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly impacts the token assignment for nodes in the cluster, which can significantly affect the distribution of data and overall system performance. The code context shows that the configuration involves performance-related operations such as generating tokens based on user input, allocationKeyspace, or random selection. These operations can be time-expensive and memory-expensive, leading to notable performance variations at the system level. Therefore, the 'initial_token' configuration is considered performance-sensitive based on its direct and substantial impact on system performance."
