    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'internode_compression' configuration is performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly impacts the system performance by determining whether the connection between nodes should be compressed, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The code snippet provided shows that the configuration is used in the shouldCompressConnection method, which involves performance-related operations that are time-expensive (compression) and memory-expensive (network bandwidth usage and CPU utilization). Additionally, the triggering frequency of the configuration depends on the number of inter-node communications, indicating its potential impact on system performance."
