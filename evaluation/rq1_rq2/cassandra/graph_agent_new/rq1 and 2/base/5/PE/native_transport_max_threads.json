    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option native_transport_max_threads is performance-sensitive because it directly affects the concurrency and performance of request handling in the system. The code context shows that this configuration is used to set the maximum number of threads for handling requests in the dispatcher. The value obtained from DatabaseDescriptor.getNativeTransportMaxThreads() is crucial for creating the requestExecutor, which is a time-expensive operation. Modifying this configuration can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, impacting the system's overall performance and resource utilization."
