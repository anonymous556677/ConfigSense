    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'client_encryption_options' configuration is performance-sensitive. The configuration involves creating and caching SSL contexts, which are time-expensive and memory-expensive operations. These operations directly impact system performance at the system level by consuming resources, especially direct memory. Enabling encryption for client-to-server communication ensures secure data transmission but at the cost of notable performance variations due to the resource-intensive nature of SSL context creation and caching."
