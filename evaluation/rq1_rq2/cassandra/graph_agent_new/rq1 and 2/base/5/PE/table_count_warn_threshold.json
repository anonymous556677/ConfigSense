    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'table_count_warn_threshold' is considered performance-sensitive. This is because the value set for this configuration directly affects the performance of the system at the system level. If the number of tables in the cluster exceeds the threshold set by this configuration, a warning message is logged and returned to the client, indicating a potential performance degradation. The code snippet related to this configuration involves time-expensive operations such as getting the number of tables in the cluster and comparing it with the threshold value. This comparison can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, making it performance-sensitive."
