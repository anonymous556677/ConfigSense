    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'internode_application_send_queue_reserve_global_capacity_in_bytes' is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the configuration directly impacts the amount of queued messages and the message processing within the cluster. The code context provided shows that this configuration is related to monitoring and managing outbound connections, which can have a significant impact on system performance. Additionally, the developer's explanation highlights that setting a higher value for this configuration can increase memory usage and processing overhead, while setting a lower value can impact message delivery speed. Therefore, the configuration involves performance-related operations that are time-expensive and memory-expensive, leading to notable performance variations at the system level."
