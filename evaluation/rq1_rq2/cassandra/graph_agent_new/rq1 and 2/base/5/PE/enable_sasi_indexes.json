    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The 'enable_sasi_indexes' configuration option does not directly involve any performance-related operations that are time-extensive or memory-extensive within its related code. The configuration simply checks if SASI indexes are enabled or disabled and throws an exception if they are disabled. This check does not have a substantial impact on system performance at the system level. Therefore, based on the code context and provided information, the configuration is not considered performance-sensitive."
