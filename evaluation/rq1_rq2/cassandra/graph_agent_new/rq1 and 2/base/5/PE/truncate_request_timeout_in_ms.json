{
    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'truncate_request_timeout_in_ms' configuration is classified as performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the configuration directly impacts the timeout for truncates to complete in the system. The code snippets related to this configuration involve time-expensive operations such as calculating timeout values and handling timeout exceptions. These operations can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, making the configuration performance-sensitive."
