    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'transparent_data_encryption_options' configuration is performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration involves encryption and decryption operations for data at-rest on disk, which are time-expensive operations. The configuration code includes methods like 'readCommitLogSegment' and 'createEncryption' that contribute to significant performance overhead due to the additional processing required for encryption and decryption. These operations can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, especially impacting disk I/O operations."
