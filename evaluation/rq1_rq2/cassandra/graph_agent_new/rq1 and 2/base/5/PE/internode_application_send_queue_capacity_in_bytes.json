    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'internode_application_send_queue_capacity_in_bytes' is performance-sensitive. This is because the code context shows that the configuration directly impacts the application send queue capacity in bytes, which in turn affects the efficiency of message processing and delivery in the cluster. The configuration involves setting limits on the size of messages queued for delivery to other nodes, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Additionally, the configuration is triggered frequently when messages are sent or received between nodes, indicating its importance in the overall system performance."
