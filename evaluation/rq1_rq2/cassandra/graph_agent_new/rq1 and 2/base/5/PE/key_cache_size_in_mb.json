    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'key_cache_size_in_mb' configuration option is performance-sensitive. This is because the size of the key cache directly impacts the memory consumption of the system, which can have a significant effect on performance. The code snippet provided shows that the key cache is initialized with the specified capacity in megabytes, and the actual memory capacity is calculated based on this configuration. Additionally, the developer's understanding mentions that setting a larger size for the key cache can improve performance by reducing seeks for key cache hits, but it also consumes more memory. Therefore, any changes to the 'key_cache_size_in_mb' configuration can lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
