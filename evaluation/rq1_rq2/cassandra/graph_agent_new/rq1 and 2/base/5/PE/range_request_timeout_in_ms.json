    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'range_request_timeout_in_ms' configuration is classified as performance-sensitive. The configuration directly affects the performance of sequential or index scans, which are time-expensive operations. The code context provided shows that the 'getRangeRpcTimeout' method is called multiple times in different parts of the code, indicating that this configuration is crucial for determining timeout values for these operations. Additionally, the developer's explanation highlights that setting a lower value for this configuration can impact response times and increase the likelihood of timeouts, further emphasizing its performance sensitivity at the system level."
