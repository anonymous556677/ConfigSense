    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'inter_dc_tcp_nodelay' is considered performance-sensitive. The code context provided shows that the tcpNoDelay method directly impacts the tcp_nodelay setting for inter-dc communication. Depending on whether the communication is within the local data center or not, different values are returned, which can significantly affect the size of network packets being sent. Enabling or disabling tcp_nodelay can have notable performance variations at the system level, especially in the case of frequent inter-dc communication requests. Additionally, the triggering frequency of this configuration is tied to the frequency of inter-dc communication requests, indicating its importance in system performance."
