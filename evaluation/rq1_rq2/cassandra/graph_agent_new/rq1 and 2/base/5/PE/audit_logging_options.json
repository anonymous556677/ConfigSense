    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The audit_logging_options configuration is considered performance-sensitive. The configuration involves enabling or disabling audit logging, which adds overhead to log every incoming CQL command request and authentication event. This can potentially impact system performance and resource utilization, especially if a large volume of requests is being logged. The code snippets related to the configuration show that enabling audit logging triggers additional operations to create and manage audit logs, which can be time-expensive and memory-expensive. These operations directly affect system performance at the system level by introducing additional processing and resource consumption."
