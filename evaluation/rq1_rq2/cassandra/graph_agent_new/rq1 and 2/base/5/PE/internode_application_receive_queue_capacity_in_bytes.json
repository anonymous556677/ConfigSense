    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'internode_application_receive_queue_capacity_in_bytes' is classified as performance-sensitive. This is because the capacity of the application receive queue directly impacts the memory consumption of the system at the system level. By setting a limit on the queue capacity, the configuration influences the amount of memory allocated for storing messages, which can lead to notable performance variations based on the volume of internode communication. The code context ensures that the application receive queue capacity is set to the configured value or default, emphasizing the importance of this configuration for memory management and system performance."
