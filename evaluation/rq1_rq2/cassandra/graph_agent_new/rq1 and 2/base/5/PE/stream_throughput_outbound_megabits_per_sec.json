    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'stream_throughput_outbound_megabits_per_sec' is classified as performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly impacts the outbound stream throughput in megabits per second for streaming file transfers between datacenters. The setStreamThroughputMbPerSec method, which updates the throughput value, and the calculateRateInBytes method, which calculates the rate in bytes based on the configured throughput, are performance-related operations that contribute significantly to execution time and memory consumption. Changes in the throughput value can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, making this configuration performance-sensitive."
