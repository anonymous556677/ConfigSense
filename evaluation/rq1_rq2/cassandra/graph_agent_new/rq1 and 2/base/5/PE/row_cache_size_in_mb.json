    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'row_cache_size_in_mb' configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the memory consumption of the row cache, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The code snippets provided show that the configuration value is used to set the capacity of the cache in bytes, affecting the amount of memory allocated for the cache. This can result in increased memory usage and potential performance improvements in read operations, but also carries the risk of over-allocating memory and causing issues such as swapping, highlighting the significant impact of this configuration on system performance."
