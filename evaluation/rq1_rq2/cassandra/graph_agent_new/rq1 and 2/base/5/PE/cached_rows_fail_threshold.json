    "Reason": "The 'cached_rows_fail_threshold' configuration does not directly involve any performance-related operations that are time-expensive or memory-expensive within its related code. The configuration is used to set a threshold for the number of cached replica rows that can fail before triggering a specific action, which does not lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The code snippet provided does not show any significant performance impact related to this configuration."
