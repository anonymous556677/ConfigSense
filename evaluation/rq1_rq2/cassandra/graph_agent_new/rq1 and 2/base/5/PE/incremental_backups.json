    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The 'incremental_backups' configuration does not involve any performance-sensitive operations that significantly impact system performance. The code snippet provided simply checks if incremental backups are enabled and creates hard links to SSTables in a backups/ subdirectory. While this may consume additional disk space, it does not contribute to notable performance variations at the system level. Therefore, the configuration is not considered performance-sensitive."
