    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'internode_tcp_connect_timeout_in_ms' is classified as performance-sensitive. The code context provided includes methods that directly retrieve the timeout value for internode tcp connections. This configuration is crucial for setting the amount of time to wait for internode tcp connections to establish in Cassandra, impacting the system's performance at the network level. The configuration involves performance-related operations that are time-sensitive, as setting an appropriate timeout is essential for preventing network issues and connection failures. Therefore, any variations in this configuration can lead to notable performance differences at the system level."
