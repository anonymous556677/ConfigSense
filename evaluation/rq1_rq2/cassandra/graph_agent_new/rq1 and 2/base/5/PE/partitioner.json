    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'partitioner' configuration is performance-sensitive. This configuration directly affects how data is distributed across nodes in the cluster, impacting system performance at the system level. Changing the partitioner requires reloading all data, which can be time-consuming and resource-intensive. Additionally, the 'partitioner' configuration is used in various methods like persistLocalMetadata, getInstance, and cleanupPending, which are performance-sensitive operations contributing to notable performance variations."
