    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'repaired_data_tracking_for_range_reads_enabled' is performance-sensitive. The code context shows that this configuration directly affects the behavior of the query method by setting the 'trackRepairedStatus' variable based on the value of 'DatabaseDescriptor.getRepairedDataTrackingForRangeReadsEnabled()'. This means that enabling or disabling this configuration impacts the execution path of the query method, introducing additional overhead related to tracking repaired data during reads and comparison between replicas. This overhead can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, especially when there are multiple full replicas to compare results from. Therefore, the configuration is considered performance-sensitive as it involves time-expensive operations related to tracking repaired data during range reads."
