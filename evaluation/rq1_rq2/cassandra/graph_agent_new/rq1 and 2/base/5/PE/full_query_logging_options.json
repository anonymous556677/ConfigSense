    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'full_query_logging_options' is classified as performance-sensitive. This is because the 'getFullQueryLoggerOptions()' method involves operations that can be time-expensive and memory-expensive. The method creates a new FullQueryLoggerOptions object and sets its properties based on the BinLogOptions, which can have a notable performance impact. Additionally, setting options such as log directory, roll cycle, blocking behavior, max queue weight, max log size, archive command, and max archive retries can affect the storage usage, performance, and behavior of the system when logging full queries, leading to substantial performance variations at the system level."
