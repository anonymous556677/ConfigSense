    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'inter_dc_stream_throughput_outbound_megabits_per_sec' is performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly affects the rate at which data is transferred between datacenters, which can have a significant impact on system performance. The code context provided shows that the configuration value is used to calculate the inter-DC rate in bytes, which is a time-expensive operation. Additionally, the configuration involves setting and retrieving values that can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, making it performance-sensitive."
