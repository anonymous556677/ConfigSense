    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'ideal_consistency_level' configuration is classified as performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly impacts the performance of the system at the system level by adding overhead to the write response handling process. The code related to this configuration involves setting up response handlers based on the ideal consistency level, which can lead to notable performance variations, especially under high write loads. The configuration involves performance-related operations that are time-expensive and memory-expensive, making it performance-sensitive."
