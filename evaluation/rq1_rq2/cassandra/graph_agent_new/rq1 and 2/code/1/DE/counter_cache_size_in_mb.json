    "config_description": "Maximum size of the counter cache in memory.  Counter cache helps to reduce counter locks' contention for hot counter cells. In case of RF = 1 a counter cache hit will cause Cassandra to skip the read before write entirely. With RF > 1 a counter cache hit will still help to reduce the duration of the lock hold, helping with hot counter cell updates, but will not allow skipping the read entirely. Only the local (clock, count) tuple of a counter cell is kept in memory, not the whole counter, so it's relatively cheap.  NOTE: if you reduce the size, you may not get you hottest keys loaded on startup.  Default value is empty to make it \"auto\" (min(2.5% of Heap (in MB), 50MB)). Set to 0 to disable counter cache. NOTE: if you perform counter deletes and rely on low gcgs, you should disable the counter cache.",
    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The 'counter_cache_size_in_mb' configuration is used to set the maximum size of the counter cache in memory. The code initializes a counter cache with the specified capacity in megabytes. The cache is scheduled to save keys periodically based on the configured save period.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The configuration is triggered whenever the counter cache is initialized or when the counter cache save period is reached. The frequency of triggering depends on the value set for 'counter_cache_save_period' in the configuration.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The 'counter_cache_size_in_mb' configuration impacts the memory usage of the system. Setting a higher value for this configuration can increase the memory usage for storing counter cache data, which can improve performance by reducing contention for hot counter cells. However, setting a lower value may result in not loading all the hottest keys on startup. Disabling the counter cache by setting the value to 0 can have an impact on performance, especially if counter deletes are performed and low gcgs are relied upon."
