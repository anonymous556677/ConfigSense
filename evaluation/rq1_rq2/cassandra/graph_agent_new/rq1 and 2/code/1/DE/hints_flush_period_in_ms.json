    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The configuration 'hints_flush_period_in_ms' is used to determine how often hints should be flushed from the internal buffers to disk. This is done by scheduling a task to periodically flush the buffers at the specified interval.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The configuration is triggered at a fixed interval specified by the value of 'hints_flush_period_in_ms'. This interval determines how often the flushing task is executed in the system.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the 'hints_flush_period_in_ms' configuration option is that it affects the frequency at which hints are persisted to disk. A shorter flush period may result in more frequent disk writes, potentially impacting system performance and disk I/O. On the other hand, a longer flush period may lead to delayed persistence of hints, which could impact data durability in case of node failures."
