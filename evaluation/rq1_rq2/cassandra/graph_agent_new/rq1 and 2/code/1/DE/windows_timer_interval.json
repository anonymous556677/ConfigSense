    "config_description": "The default Windows kernel timer and scheduling resolution is 15.6ms for power conservation. Lowering this value on Windows can provide much tighter latency and better throughput, however some virtualized environments may see a negative performance impact from changing this setting below their system default. The sysinternals 'clockres' tool can confirm your system's default setting.",
    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The configuration 'windows_timer_interval' is used in the code to adjust the system timer on Windows. It starts the timer with the interval specified in the configuration using the 'WindowsTimer.startTimerPeriod' method. It also stops the timer with the same interval using 'WindowsTimer.endTimerPeriod' method at different points in the code.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The triggering frequency of the 'windows_timer_interval' configuration depends on the specific points in the code where the timer is started and stopped. In the 'activate' method, the timer is started, and in the 'runMayThrow' and 'removeShutdownHook' methods, the timer is stopped. The frequency of triggering would depend on how often these methods are called during the system operation.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of changing the 'windows_timer_interval' configuration is that it can provide much tighter latency and better throughput on Windows systems. However, in some virtualized environments, changing this setting below their system default may result in a negative performance impact. It is recommended to use tools like 'clockres' to confirm the system's default setting before making any changes."
