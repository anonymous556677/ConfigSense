    "config_description": "Set keep-alive period for streaming This node will send a keep-alive message periodically with this period. If the node does not receive a keep-alive message from the peer for 2 keep-alive cycles the stream session times out and fail Default value is 300s (5 minutes), which means stalled stream times out in 10 minutes by default",
    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The configuration 'streaming_keep_alive_period_in_secs' is used to set the keep-alive period for streaming in the code. It determines how often a keep-alive message is sent between nodes to maintain the stream session.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The configuration is triggered when a keep-alive task is scheduled with the specified period using 'scheduleAtFixedRate' method. The keep-alive task is scheduled to run at fixed intervals defined by the 'streaming_keep_alive_period_in_secs' value.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the 'streaming_keep_alive_period_in_secs' configuration option is significant as it affects the stability and reliability of the streaming sessions between nodes. A shorter period may result in more frequent keep-alive messages being sent, increasing network traffic but ensuring quicker detection of stalled streams. On the other hand, a longer period may reduce network overhead but increase the time taken to detect stalled streams, potentially leading to longer session timeouts."
