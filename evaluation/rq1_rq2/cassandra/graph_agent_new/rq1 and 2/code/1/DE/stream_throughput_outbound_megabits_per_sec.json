    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The configuration 'stream_throughput_outbound_megabits_per_sec' controls the outbound stream throughput in megabits per second for streaming file transfers between datacenters. The code provided includes methods to set and get the value of this configuration, as well as a method to calculate the rate in bytes based on the configured throughput.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The configuration is triggered whenever the setStreamThroughputMbPerSec method is called to update the value of the outbound stream throughput. The frequency of triggering depends on how often this method is invoked in the system.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the 'stream_throughput_outbound_megabits_per_sec' configuration option is significant as it directly affects the rate at which streaming file transfers occur between datacenters. A higher throughput value will result in faster file transfers, while a lower value will throttle the transfer speed. Setting the throughput to 0 or a negative value disables throttling and allows for unlimited throughput."
