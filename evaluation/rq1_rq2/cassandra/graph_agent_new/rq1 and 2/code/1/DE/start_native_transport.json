If the value is true or if the property is not set and the DatabaseDescriptor.startNativeTransport() method returns true, then the native transport server is started by calling the startNativeTransport() method.",

If the property is set to true or the method returns true, the configuration will be triggered to start the native transport server.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the 'start_native_transport' configuration option is significant as it determines whether the native transport server is started or not. Starting the native transport server allows clients to connect to the Cassandra cluster using the native protocol, which can impact the system's performance and accessibility."
