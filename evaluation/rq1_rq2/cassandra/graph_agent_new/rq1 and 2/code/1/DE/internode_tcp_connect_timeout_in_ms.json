The method tcpConnectTimeoutInMS() checks if the value is set and returns it, otherwise it retrieves the value from DatabaseDescriptor.getInternodeTcpConnectTimeoutInMS().",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The triggering frequency of the 'internode_tcp_connect_timeout_in_ms' configuration depends on the network conditions and the frequency of internode tcp connections being established in the system. It is typically triggered when nodes in the Cassandra cluster need to establish tcp connections with each other.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the 'internode_tcp_connect_timeout_in_ms' configuration option is crucial for protecting Cassandra from true network partitions. Setting an appropriate timeout can prevent potential issues related to network connectivity and ensure the stability of the Cassandra cluster."
