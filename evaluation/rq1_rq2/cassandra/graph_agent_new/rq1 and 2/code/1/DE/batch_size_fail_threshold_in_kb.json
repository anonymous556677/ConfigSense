It is retrieved using the method getBatchSizeFailureThreshold() which internally calls DatabaseDescriptor.getBatchSizeFailThresholdInKB(). This value is then used to check if a batch exceeds the threshold and should fail.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The triggering frequency of the 'batch_size_fail_threshold_in_kb' configuration depends on the workload and data being processed by the system. If batches frequently exceed the specified threshold, the configuration will be triggered more often.",

If the threshold is set too low, it may result in frequent batch failures and potentially impact the performance of the system. On the other hand, setting it too high may lead to inefficient use of resources and potential bottlenecks in the system."
