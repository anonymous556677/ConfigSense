    "config_description": "Enable operation timeout information exchange between nodes to accurately measure request timeouts.  If disabled, replicas will assume that requests were forwarded to them instantly by the coordinator, which means that under overload conditions we will waste that much extra time processing already-timed-out requests.  Warning: It is generally assumed that users have setup NTP on their clusters, and that clocks are modestly in sync, since this is a requirement for general correctness of last write wins.",
    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The configuration 'cross_node_timeout' is checked in the code to determine if operation timeout information exchange between nodes should be enabled. If the configuration is enabled and the createdAtNanos is greater than the currentTimeNanos, the createdAtNanos is updated to the currentTimeNanos. The function then calculates and returns the expiration time by adding the expirationPeriodNanos to the createdAtNanos.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The triggering frequency of the 'cross_node_timeout' configuration depends on the specific operations that involve cross-node communication and timeout handling. It is triggered whenever the system needs to exchange timeout information between nodes to accurately measure request timeouts.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the 'cross_node_timeout' configuration option is significant in ensuring accurate measurement of request timeouts in a distributed system. If disabled, replicas may incorrectly assume that requests were forwarded instantly, leading to wasted processing time on already-timed-out requests under overload conditions. It is crucial for maintaining system efficiency and preventing unnecessary processing delays."
