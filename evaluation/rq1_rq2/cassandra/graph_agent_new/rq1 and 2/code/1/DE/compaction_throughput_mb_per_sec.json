The faster you insert data, the faster you need to compact in order to keep the sstable count down, but in general, setting this to 16 to 32 times the rate you are inserting data is more than sufficient. Setting this to 0 disables throttling. Note that this accounts for all types of compaction, including validation compaction (building Merkle trees for repairs).",

    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The triggering frequency of the 'compaction_throughput_mb_per_sec' configuration depends on the rate at which data is inserted into the system. The faster data is inserted, the more frequently compaction will be triggered to keep the sstable count down.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of setting the 'compaction_throughput_mb_per_sec' configuration is that it controls the speed at which compaction occurs in the system. Setting it too low may result in slower compaction and potentially higher sstable counts, while setting it too high may lead to unnecessary throttling and resource usage."
