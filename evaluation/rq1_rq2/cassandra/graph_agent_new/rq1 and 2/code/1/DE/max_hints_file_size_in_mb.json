    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The configuration 'max_hints_file_size_in_mb' is used to determine the maximum size for a single hints file in megabytes. In the provided code snippet, the value of 'maxHintsFileSize' is obtained from 'DatabaseDescriptor.getMaxHintsFileSize()' and is used to limit the size of the hints file being written to.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The triggering frequency of the 'max_hints_file_size_in_mb' configuration depends on how often the 'flushInternal' method is called in the system. The frequency of this configuration being triggered would depend on the frequency of writing hints to the hints file and the size of the data being written.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the 'max_hints_file_size_in_mb' configuration option on the system is that it limits the size of individual hints files. This can impact the storage space usage and performance of the system, as larger hints files may consume more disk space and potentially affect the efficiency of hint storage and retrieval operations."
