This means that only partition information is held on heap and the index entries are read from disk.  Note that this size refers to the size of the serialized index information and not the size of the partition.",
    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The configuration 'column_index_cache_size_in_kb' is used to determine the size limit for sstable indexed key cache entries. If the size of the entries exceeds this limit, they will not be held in heap memory and will be read from disk instead.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The triggering frequency of the 'column_index_cache_size_in_kb' configuration depends on the amount of indexed key cache entries being stored and accessed in the system. If the size of the entries exceeds the configured limit, the configuration will be triggered.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the 'column_index_cache_size_in_kb' configuration option is that it affects the memory usage of the system. By setting a limit on the size of indexed key cache entries, it helps manage memory usage and ensures that only partition information is held in heap memory while index entries are read from disk. This can improve system performance by preventing excessive memory usage and optimizing data access."
