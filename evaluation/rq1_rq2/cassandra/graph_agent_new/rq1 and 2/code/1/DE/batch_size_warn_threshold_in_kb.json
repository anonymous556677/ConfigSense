    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The configuration 'batch_size_warn_threshold_in_kb' is used to set a threshold value for logging a WARN message when a multiple-partition batch size exceeds the specified value. The method getBatchSizeWarnThreshold() returns the value of this configuration parameter by calling DatabaseDescriptor.getBatchSizeWarnThresholdInKB().",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The triggering frequency of the 'batch_size_warn_threshold_in_kb' configuration depends on the batch sizes of multiple-partition operations in the system. If any batch size exceeds the threshold value set by this configuration, a WARN message will be logged.",

It is important to carefully consider the implications of changing this configuration to avoid potential performance issues."
