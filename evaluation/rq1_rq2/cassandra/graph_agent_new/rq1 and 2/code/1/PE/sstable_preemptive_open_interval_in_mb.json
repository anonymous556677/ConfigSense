    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'sstable_preemptive_open_interval_in_mb' is performance-sensitive. This is because the value of the configuration directly affects the calculation of the 'interval' variable in the 'calculateOpenInterval' method, which is a time-expensive operation. The 'interval' value is then used in determining when to open SSTables preemptively, which can have a significant impact on system performance. Additionally, the 'getSSTablePreemptiveOpenIntervalInMB' method is called to retrieve the configuration value, indicating its importance in the system's performance."
