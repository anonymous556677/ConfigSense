    "Reason": "The 'incremental_backups' configuration does not involve any performance-related operations that are time-extensive or memory-extensive within its related code. The code snippet provided simply checks if incremental backups are enabled and creates links for SSTableReader objects. These operations are not time-expensive or memory-expensive and do not lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Therefore, the configuration is not performance-sensitive."
