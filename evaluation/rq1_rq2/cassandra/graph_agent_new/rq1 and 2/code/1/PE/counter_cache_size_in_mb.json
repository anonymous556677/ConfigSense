    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'counter_cache_size_in_mb' is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the 'counter_cache_size_in_mb' directly affects the capacity of the counter cache, which in turn impacts the memory consumption of the system. The code snippet shows that the size of the cache is calculated based on this configuration option, and a larger cache size can lead to increased memory usage. Additionally, the scheduling of cache saves and the frequency of saving keys are also dependent on this configuration, which can have a significant impact on system performance. Therefore, any changes to 'counter_cache_size_in_mb' can result in notable performance variations at the system level."
