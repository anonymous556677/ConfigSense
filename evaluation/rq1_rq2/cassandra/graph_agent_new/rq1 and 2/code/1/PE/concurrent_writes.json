    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'concurrent_writes' configuration is performance-sensitive. The configuration involves the use of Striped<Lock> LOCKS, which is dependent on the value of DatabaseDescriptor.getConcurrentWriters(). The LOCKS are used to manage concurrency during prepare, propose, and commit operations in the PaxosState class. These operations involve acquiring and releasing locks, which are time-expensive and can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Additionally, the configuration directly impacts the execution time and memory consumption of the system due to the use of locks for synchronization, making it performance-sensitive."
