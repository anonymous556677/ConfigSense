    "Reason": "The configuration option 'stream_entire_sstables' does not involve any performance-related operations that are time-extensive or memory-extensive within its related code. The code snippet provided simply checks if full sstable transfers are disabled or if legacy counter shards are present before returning a boolean value. This configuration does not directly and substantially affect system performance at the system level, therefore it is not considered performance-sensitive."
