    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'enable_transient_replication' is performance-sensitive. This is because the code snippet related to this configuration involves operations that directly impact system performance. Specifically, the validation of transient replication in the code can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The presence of conditional statements based on the state of transient replication and the checks for enabling transient replication in the code indicate that this configuration has a significant impact on system performance."
