    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'max_hints_delivery_threads' is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the 'maxDeliveryThreads' configuration directly affects the performance of the system by determining the maximum number of threads used for delivering hints. This configuration is crucial for optimizing the delivery of hints and can have a significant impact on the overall performance of the system. Additionally, the code snippet related to 'maxDeliveryThreads' involves time-expensive operations such as creating and managing thread pools, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
