    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'internode_tcp_connect_timeout_in_ms' is performance-sensitive. The code context provided shows that this configuration directly affects the TCP connection timeout in the system, which can have a significant impact on system performance. The 'tcpConnectTimeoutInMS' method returns the value of 'internode_tcp_connect_timeout_in_ms' if it is not null, otherwise it retrieves the value from 'DatabaseDescriptor.getInternodeTcpConnectTimeoutInMS()'. This indicates that changing the 'internode_tcp_connect_timeout_in_ms' configuration can directly impact the TCP connection timeout, which is a critical performance-related operation. Therefore, any changes to this configuration can lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
