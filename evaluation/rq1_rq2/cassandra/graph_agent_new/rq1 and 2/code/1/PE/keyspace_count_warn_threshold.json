    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'keyspace_count_warn_threshold' is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the 'keyspaceCount' variable is directly dependent on the value of 'keyspaceCountWarnThreshold()' method from 'DatabaseDescriptor'. If the 'keyspaceCount' exceeds the threshold set by 'keyspaceCountWarnThreshold()', it triggers a warning message and potentially slows down schema-dependent cluster operations. This configuration directly affects system performance by introducing a check that can lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
