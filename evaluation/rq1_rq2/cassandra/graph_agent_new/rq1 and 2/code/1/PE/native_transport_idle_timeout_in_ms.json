{
    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'native_transport_idle_timeout_in_ms' is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the idle timeout value directly affects the performance of the system at the system level. The code snippet shows that when the idle timeout is reached, the client connection is closed, which can have a significant impact on system performance. Additionally, the idle timeout value is a time-expensive operation that can lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
