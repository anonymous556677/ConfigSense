{
    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'file_cache_enabled' configuration option is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the 'file_cache_enabled' configuration directly affects the system performance at the system level. The code context shows that the 'file_cache_enabled' configuration is used to determine if the ChunkCache instance should be created based on the value of 'enabled'. This directly impacts the memory consumption and execution time of the system by initializing the ChunkCache instance with the BufferPools.forChunkCache(). Additionally, the 'file_cache_enabled' configuration involves performance-related operations such as cacheSize calculation and conditional check for cacheSize > 0, which contribute to notable performance variations at the system level."
