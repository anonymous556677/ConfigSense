    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'num_tokens' is performance-sensitive. The code context provided contains operations that directly impact system performance, such as checking the number of tokens and throwing exceptions based on certain conditions. The 'num_tokens' configuration involves performance-related operations that are time-expensive and memory-expensive, leading to notable performance variations at the system level. The code snippets within the 'num_tokens' configuration code contribute significantly to execution time and memory consumption, making it performance-sensitive."
