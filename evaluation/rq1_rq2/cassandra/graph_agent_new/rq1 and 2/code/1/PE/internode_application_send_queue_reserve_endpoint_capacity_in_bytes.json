    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'internode_application_send_queue_reserve_endpoint_capacity_in_bytes' is classified as performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the code snippet provided directly involves performance-related operations that can have a notable impact on system performance. The 'applicationReserveSendQueueEndpointCapacityInBytes' and 'applicationReserveSendQueueGlobalCapacityInBytes' variables are initialized based on the configuration values, and these values are used in the 'withApplicationReserveSendQueueCapacityInBytes' method, which can affect the outbound connection settings. Any changes in the 'internode_application_send_queue_reserve_endpoint_capacity_in_bytes' configuration can lead to significant performance variations at the system level."
