    "classification_result": "Performance-insensitive with 100% confidence",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'Duration in seconds after which Cassandra should save the row cache' is performance-insensitive because it only determines when the row cache should be saved to the disk for potential future use. This operation does not directly impact system performance or any time-dependent aspects of system operation."
