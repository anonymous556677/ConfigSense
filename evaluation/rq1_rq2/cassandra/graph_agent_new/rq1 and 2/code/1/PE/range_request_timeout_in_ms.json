    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'range_request_timeout_in_ms' is performance-sensitive. This is because the 'getRangeRpcTimeout' method directly affects system performance by retrieving the range RPC timeout value from the DatabaseDescriptor, which is a time-expensive operation. The code context shows that this configuration involves performance-related operations that contribute significantly to execution time, making it performance-sensitive at the system level."
