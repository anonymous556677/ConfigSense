    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'streaming_keep_alive_period_in_secs' is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the value of 'streaming_keep_alive_period_in_secs' directly affects the keep-alive task scheduling in the code context provided. The 'keepAlivePeriod' is set based on this configuration, and it is used to schedule a task at a fixed rate. Changing the value of 'streaming_keep_alive_period_in_secs' can have a direct impact on the frequency of keep-alive tasks, which can significantly affect system performance, especially in scenarios where streaming connections need to be maintained efficiently. Therefore, any changes to this configuration can lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
