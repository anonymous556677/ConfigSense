    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'windows_timer_interval' is performance-sensitive. The code context shows that the configuration directly affects the system timer interval on Windows, which impacts timer intervals, thread scheduling, driver interrupts, etc. This adjustment of the system timer interval is a time-extensive operation that can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Additionally, the configuration-related code includes performance-related operations that contribute significantly to execution time and memory consumption, making it performance-sensitive."
