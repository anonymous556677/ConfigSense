{
    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'dynamic_snitch_reset_interval_in_ms' is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the 'dynamicResetInterval' configuration directly affects the system's performance by setting the interval for resetting the dynamic endpoint snitch. This interval is used to schedule a task that resets the scores of hosts, which can have a notable impact on the system's performance. Additionally, the code context shows that the 'resetSchedular' task is scheduled with a fixed delay based on the 'dynamicResetInterval' configuration, indicating that this configuration is time-expensive and can lead to significant performance variations at the system level."
