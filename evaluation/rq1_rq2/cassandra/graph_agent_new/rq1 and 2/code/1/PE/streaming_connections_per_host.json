    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'streaming_connections_per_host' is performance-sensitive. This is because the 'DatabaseDescriptor.getStreamingConnectionsPerHost()' method is being used in the code context to determine the number of streaming connections per host. This configuration directly impacts the performance of the system by influencing the number of concurrent streaming connections established during operations like bootstrap and rebuild. The number of streaming connections per host can significantly affect the overall performance of these operations, making this configuration performance-sensitive."
