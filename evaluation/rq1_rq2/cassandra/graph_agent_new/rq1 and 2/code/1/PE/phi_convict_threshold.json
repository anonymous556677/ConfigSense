    "classification_result": "Performance-insensitive with 100% confidence",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'phi value that must be reached for a host to be marked down' is related to host monitoring and marking down, which does not directly impact system performance. It is unlikely to affect the overall performance of the system as it is not related to any time-dependent aspects or performance-sensitive operations."
