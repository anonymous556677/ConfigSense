    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'server_encryption_options' configuration is performance-sensitive. The configuration involves operations related to SSL certificates, encryption, and socket handling, which are time-expensive and memory-expensive. These operations directly impact system performance at the system level, leading to notable performance variations. The code context shows the creation of SSL contexts, validation of SSL certificates, and handling of encryption options, all of which are critical for system performance."
