    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'periodic_commitlog_sync_lag_block_in_ms' is performance-sensitive. The code context provided shows that this configuration directly affects the waiting time for commit log sync operations. The 'blockWhenSyncLagsNanos' value is calculated based on the 'periodicCommitLogSyncBlock' configuration, which indicates a time-expensive operation. The 'maybeWaitForSync' method also involves time-expensive operations that can significantly impact system performance. Therefore, this configuration is considered performance-sensitive as it directly influences the performance of commit log sync operations at the system level."
