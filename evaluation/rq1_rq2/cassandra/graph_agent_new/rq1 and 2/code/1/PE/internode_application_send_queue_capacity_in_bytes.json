    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'internode_application_send_queue_capacity_in_bytes' is performance-sensitive. The code context shows that this configuration directly affects the application's send queue capacity, which can have a significant impact on system performance. This configuration involves a performance-related operation that determines the capacity of the send queue, which can be time-expensive and memory-expensive. Changes in this configuration can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, making it a performance-sensitive configuration."
