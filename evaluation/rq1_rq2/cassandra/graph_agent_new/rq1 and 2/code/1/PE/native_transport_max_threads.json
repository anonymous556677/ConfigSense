{
    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'native_transport_max_threads' is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the 'native_transport_max_threads' configuration directly affects the performance of the system at the system level. The code context provided shows that the 'native_transport_max_threads' configuration is used to create an executor service with a specific number of threads for processing native transport requests. This configuration directly impacts the concurrency and parallelism of handling incoming requests, which can have a significant impact on the overall performance of the system. Additionally, the code snippet related to the configuration involves time-expensive operations like submitting requests to the executor service, which further emphasizes the performance sensitivity of this configuration."
