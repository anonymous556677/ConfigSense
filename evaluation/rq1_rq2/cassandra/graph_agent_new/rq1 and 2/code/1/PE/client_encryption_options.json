    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'client_encryption_options' is performance-sensitive. The code context provided includes operations that are time-expensive and memory-expensive, such as creating and caching SSL contexts, initializing SSL certificates, and performing hot reloading of SSL certificates. These operations directly impact system performance at the system level by consuming a lot of resources, especially direct memory, and leading to notable performance variations. Additionally, the configuration involves performance-related operations that contribute significantly to execution time and memory consumption, making it performance-sensitive."
