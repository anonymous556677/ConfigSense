{
    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'concurrent_materialized_view_builders' is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the configuration directly affects the number of concurrent view builders, which can impact the performance of compaction operations at the system level. The code context shows that the configuration is used to set the number of concurrent view builders in the CompactionManager class, which is crucial for managing ongoing compactions efficiently. Adjusting this configuration can lead to notable performance variations in compaction tasks, making it a performance-sensitive option."
