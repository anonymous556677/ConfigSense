    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'concurrent_counter_writes' is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the 'concurrent_counter_writes' configuration directly affects the system performance at the system level. The code context shows that this configuration involves performance-related operations that are time-expensive, such as grabbing striped cell-level locks, reading and writing counter values, and updating counter cache. These operations contribute significantly to execution time and memory consumption, leading to notable performance variations at the system level."
