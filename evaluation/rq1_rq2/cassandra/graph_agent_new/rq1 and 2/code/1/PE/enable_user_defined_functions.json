    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'enable_user_defined_functions' is performance-sensitive. The code context provided shows that the configuration directly affects the execution flow by checking if user-defined functions are enabled in the cassandra.yaml file. Enabling user-defined functions can introduce time-expensive operations that impact system performance significantly. Additionally, the configuration involves checking for scripted user-defined functions, which can also have a notable performance impact. Therefore, this configuration is considered performance-sensitive as it directly affects system performance at the system level."
