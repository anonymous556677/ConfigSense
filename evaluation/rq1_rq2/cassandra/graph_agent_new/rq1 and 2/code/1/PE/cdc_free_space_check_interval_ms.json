    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'cdc_free_space_check_interval_ms' is performance-sensitive. This is because the 'cdc_free_space_check_interval_ms' configuration involves performance-related operations that are time-expensive and memory-expensive within the 'CommitLogSegmentManagerCDC' class. The configuration directly affects system performance at the system level by managing the CDC size tracking, calculating disk space usage, and handling segment creation and deletion based on CDC mutations. These operations have a notable impact on performance variations at the system level, making the configuration performance-sensitive."
