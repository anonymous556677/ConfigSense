    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'allocate_tokens_for_keyspace' is performance-sensitive. This is because the code context provided shows that the configuration involves operations that can significantly impact system performance. The configuration directly affects the token allocation algorithm, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The code includes operations that are time-expensive, such as token allocation and generation, which can have a substantial impact on system performance. Therefore, based on the code context and the nature of the configuration-related operations, it can be classified as performance-sensitive."
