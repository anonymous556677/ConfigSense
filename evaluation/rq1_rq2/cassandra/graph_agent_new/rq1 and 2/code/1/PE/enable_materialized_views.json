    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'enable_materialized_views' is not performance-sensitive. The code related to this configuration does not involve any performance-related operations that are time-expensive or memory-expensive. The configuration mainly deals with validation checks, building metadata, and processing clauses, which do not directly and substantially affect system performance at the system level. Therefore, it does not lead to notable performance variations and should be classified as not performance-sensitive."
