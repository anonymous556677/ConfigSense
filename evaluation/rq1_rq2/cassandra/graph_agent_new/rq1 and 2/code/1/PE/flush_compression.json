    "classification_result": "Performance-insensitive with 100% confidence",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'Compression to apply to SSTables' is performance-insensitive because it only affects the way data is compressed when flushing SSTables. This operation does not directly impact system performance or any time-dependent aspects of system operation."
