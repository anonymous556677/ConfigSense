    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'repair_session_space_in_mb' is performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly affects the amount of memory allocated for creating Merkle Trees during the validation process. The 'availableBytes' calculation in the code snippet is based on this configuration, and it determines the memory budget for holding RF trees in memory. The 'rangeAvailableBytes' calculation further refines the memory allocation based on the size of the range being processed. The memory-intensive operations involved in calculating and setting the tree depth based on the number of partitions also contribute to the performance sensitivity of this configuration. Overall, the configuration impacts memory consumption significantly and leads to notable performance variations at the system level."
