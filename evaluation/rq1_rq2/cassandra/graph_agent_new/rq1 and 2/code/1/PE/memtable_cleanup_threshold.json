    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'memtable_cleanup_threshold' is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the 'cleaningThreshold' parameter directly influences the behavior of the MemtablePool creation process. The value of 'cleaningThreshold' determines when the MemtablePool will trigger the cleaning process, which can have a significant impact on system performance. Additionally, the 'cleaningThreshold' parameter is used in conjunction with other parameters to create different types of MemtablePools, each affecting memory usage and performance differently. Therefore, any changes to the 'memtable_cleanup_threshold' configuration can lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
