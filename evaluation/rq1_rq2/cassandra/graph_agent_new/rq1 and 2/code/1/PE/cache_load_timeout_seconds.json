{
    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'cache_load_timeout_seconds' is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the 'cache_load_timeout_seconds' directly impacts the performance of the system by setting a time limit for loading cache data. The code snippet shows that the configuration is used to calculate the load time for cache data and determines when to stop loading based on the timeout value. This time-sensitive operation can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, making it a performance-sensitive configuration."
