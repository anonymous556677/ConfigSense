{
    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'read_request_timeout_in_ms' is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the 'read_request_timeout_in_ms' configuration directly affects the system performance at the system level. The code context provided shows that this configuration is used to set timeouts for various read operations in the system, such as RPC timeouts for reading and repairing data. These operations are time-expensive and can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Therefore, the 'read_request_timeout_in_ms' configuration is considered performance-sensitive."
