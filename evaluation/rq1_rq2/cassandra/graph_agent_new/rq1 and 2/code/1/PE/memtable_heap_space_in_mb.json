    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'memtable_heap_space_in_mb' is performance-sensitive. This is because the 'heapLimit' and 'offHeapLimit' variables are directly derived from this configuration, which in turn affects the memory allocation for the MemtablePool. The memory allocation strategy chosen based on this configuration can have a significant impact on the overall system performance, especially in scenarios where the system is under heavy load. Therefore, any changes to this configuration can lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
