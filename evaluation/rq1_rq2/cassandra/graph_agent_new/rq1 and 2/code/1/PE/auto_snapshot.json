    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'auto_snapshot' configuration option is performance-sensitive. This classification is based on the fact that the 'auto_snapshot' configuration directly impacts the system performance at the system level. The code context shows that when 'auto_snapshot' is enabled, a snapshot of the data is taken, which involves flushing and truncating operations that are time-expensive and memory-expensive. These operations can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Additionally, the configuration involves multiple performance-related operations that contribute significantly to execution time and memory consumption, making it performance-sensitive."
