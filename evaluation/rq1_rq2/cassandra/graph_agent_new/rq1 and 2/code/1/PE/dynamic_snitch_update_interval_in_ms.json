    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'dynamic_snitch_update_interval_in_ms' is performance-sensitive. This is because the 'dynamicUpdateInterval' and 'dynamicResetInterval' values directly affect the scheduling of tasks that involve time-expensive operations (e.g., updating scores and resetting bad hosts) at the system level. The code context shows that these values are used to schedule tasks that impact the system's performance by updating scores and resetting intervals based on the configured rates. Therefore, any changes to these intervals can lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
