    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'max_concurrent_automatic_sstable_upgrades' is performance-sensitive. The code context provided shows that this configuration directly impacts the number of concurrent automatic sstable upgrades that can be performed. The 'maxConcurrentAutoUpgradeTasks()' method is called to determine the maximum number of concurrent upgrade tasks allowed. This configuration can significantly affect system performance by controlling the number of upgrade tasks running concurrently, which can have a notable impact on execution time and memory consumption at the system level."
