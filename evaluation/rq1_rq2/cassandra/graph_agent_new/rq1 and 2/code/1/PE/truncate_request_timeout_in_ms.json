    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'truncate_request_timeout_in_ms' is performance-sensitive. The code context provided shows that the 'truncate' operation involves time-expensive operations such as waiting for a timeout and handling timeout exceptions. These operations directly impact system performance and can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Additionally, the 'truncateRpcTimeout' configuration is directly related to the timeout setting for the truncate operation, which is crucial for system performance. Therefore, the configuration is considered performance-sensitive."
