    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'internode_authenticator' configuration option is performance-sensitive. This is because the 'internode_authenticator' directly affects the system's performance at the system level by setting the internode authenticator for network communication. The code related to this configuration involves operations that are time-extensive, such as constructing the internode authenticator using 'FBUtilities.construct' method. This configuration can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, especially when network communication is involved, making it performance-sensitive."
