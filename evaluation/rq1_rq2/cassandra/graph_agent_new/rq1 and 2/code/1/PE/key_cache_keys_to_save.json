    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'key_cache_keys_to_save' is not performance-sensitive. The code related to this configuration involves setting and getting the value of 'keyCacheKeysToSave', which is used to schedule cache saving operations. Although the configuration is related to cache management, it does not involve any time-expensive or memory-expensive operations that would lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The code mainly deals with managing cache keys to save and does not directly and substantially affect system performance in a significant way."
