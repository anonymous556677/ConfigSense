    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'partitioner' configuration option is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the 'partitioner' configuration directly affects the system performance at the system level. The 'partitioner' configuration is used in key areas of the code, such as building token metadata, creating system replicas, and deserializing ranges. These operations are critical for the system's functionality and performance, making the 'partitioner' configuration performance-sensitive."
