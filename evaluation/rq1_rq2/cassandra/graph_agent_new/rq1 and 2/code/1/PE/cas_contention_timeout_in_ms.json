{
    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'cas_contention_timeout_in_ms' is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the 'cas_contention_timeout_in_ms' directly affects the timeout duration for Paxos rounds in the code context provided. The timeout duration impacts the retry mechanism in the Paxos algorithm, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The configuration involves time-expensive operations related to handling contentions in the Paxos rounds, which can significantly impact system performance. Therefore, the configuration is considered performance-sensitive based on its direct and substantial effect on system performance."
