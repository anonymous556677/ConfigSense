    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'inter_dc_tcp_nodelay' is classified as performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the 'tcpNoDelay' method involves checking if the communication is within the local data center or not, and based on that, it returns the value of 'INTRADC_TCP_NODELAY' or 'DatabaseDescriptor.getInterDCTcpNoDelay()'. This decision-making process within the method involves performance-related operations that can have a notable impact on system performance at the system level, especially when dealing with inter-data center communication. Therefore, the configuration directly and substantially affects system performance, making it performance-sensitive."
