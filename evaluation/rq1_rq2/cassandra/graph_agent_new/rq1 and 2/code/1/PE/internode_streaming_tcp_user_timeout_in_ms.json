    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'internode_streaming_tcp_user_timeout_in_ms' is performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly affects the system performance at the system level by setting the timeout for processing incoming stream messages. The code snippet related to this configuration shows that if the processing time exceeds the timeout value, a warning message is logged, indicating potential performance issues. This timeout value can have a significant impact on the overall system performance, making it a performance-sensitive configuration."
