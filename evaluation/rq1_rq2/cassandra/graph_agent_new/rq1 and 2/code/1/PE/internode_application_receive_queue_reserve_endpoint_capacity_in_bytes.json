    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'internode_application_receive_queue_reserve_endpoint_capacity_in_bytes' is performance-sensitive. This is because it directly affects the system's performance at the system level by setting the capacity for the application send queue reserve endpoint in bytes. The code context shows that this configuration impacts the messaging service's outbound connections and message delivery, which are critical for internode communication. The capacity set by this configuration directly influences the memory utilization and message delivery efficiency, making it a performance-sensitive configuration."
