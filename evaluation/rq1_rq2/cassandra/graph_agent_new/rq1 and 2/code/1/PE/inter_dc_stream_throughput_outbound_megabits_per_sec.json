    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'inter_dc_stream_throughput_outbound_megabits_per_sec' is performance-sensitive. This is because the code context provided shows that this configuration directly affects the inter-DC stream throughput in bytes, which can have a significant impact on system performance. The 'calculateInterDCRateInBytes' method calculates the inter-DC rate based on this configuration, indicating that changes in this value can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Additionally, the 'setInterDCStreamThroughputMbPerSec' method updates the throughput value and triggers the 'updateInterDCThroughput' method, further emphasizing the performance impact of this configuration."
