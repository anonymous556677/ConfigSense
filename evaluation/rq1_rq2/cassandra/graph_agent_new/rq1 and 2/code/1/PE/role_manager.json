    "Reason": "The 'role_manager' configuration does not involve any performance-sensitive operations that would lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The code context primarily deals with authentication, authorization, and role management functionalities, which do not directly impact system performance in a significant way. Additionally, the configuration-related code does not contain any time-expensive or memory-expensive operations that would classify it as performance-sensitive."
