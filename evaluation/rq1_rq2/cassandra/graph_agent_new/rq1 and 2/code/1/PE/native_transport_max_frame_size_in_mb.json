    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'native_transport_max_frame_size_in_mb' is performance-sensitive. This is because the 'native_transport_max_frame_size_in_mb' configuration directly affects the maximum total length of the message envelope in the system, as seen in the 'Decoder' class where it is used to set the 'MAX_TOTAL_LENGTH'. This configuration impacts the memory consumption and processing time of handling messages, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
