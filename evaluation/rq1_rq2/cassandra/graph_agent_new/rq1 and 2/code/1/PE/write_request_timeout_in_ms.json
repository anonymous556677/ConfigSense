{
    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'write_request_timeout_in_ms' is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the configuration directly affects the system performance at the system level. The code context related to this configuration involves operations that contribute to execution time and memory consumption, such as applying mutations, acquiring locks, updating indexes, and handling timeouts. These operations are time-expensive and memory-expensive, leading to notable performance variations at the system level. Additionally, the configuration involves setting timeouts for various write operations, which are critical for system performance and can impact overall system responsiveness and reliability."
