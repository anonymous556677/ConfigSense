    "Reason": "The configuration option 'cross_node_timeout' is not performance-sensitive. The code snippet provided does not involve any time-expensive or memory-expensive operations related to this configuration. The 'cross_node_timeout' configuration only checks if DatabaseDescriptor has a cross-node timeout and compares the 'createdAtNanos' with 'currentTimeNanos'. This comparison does not directly and substantially affect system performance at the system level, leading to notable performance variations. Therefore, it is considered to have a trivial performance impact and is not performance-sensitive."
