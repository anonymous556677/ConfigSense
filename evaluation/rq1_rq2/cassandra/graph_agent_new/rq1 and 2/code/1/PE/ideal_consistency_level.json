    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'ideal_consistency_level' is performance-sensitive. This is because the 'ideal_consistency_level' directly affects the performance of the system by tracking the ideal consistency level for write operations. The code snippet related to the configuration involves performance-related operations such as constructing response handlers based on the ideal consistency level and tracking the consistency level. These operations are time-expensive and can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, making the configuration performance-sensitive."
