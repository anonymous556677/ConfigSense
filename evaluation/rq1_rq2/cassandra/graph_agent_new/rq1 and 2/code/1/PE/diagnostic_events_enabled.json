    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'diagnostic_events_enabled' is performance-sensitive. This is because the 'diagnosticEventsEnabled()' method from 'DatabaseDescriptor' class is being called multiple times within the code context provided. This method directly influences whether events are enabled for specified event classes, which can have a significant impact on the system performance. Additionally, the 'isEnabled' methods also depend on the 'diagnosticEventsEnabled()' method, further emphasizing the performance sensitivity of this configuration."
