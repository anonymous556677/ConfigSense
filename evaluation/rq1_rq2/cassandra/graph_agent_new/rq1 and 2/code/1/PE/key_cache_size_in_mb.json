    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'key_cache_size_in_mb' is not performance-sensitive. The code context provided shows that this configuration is used to initialize a key cache with a specified capacity in MBs. While the size of the key cache may impact memory consumption, the code does not contain any performance-related operations that are time-expensive or memory-expensive. Additionally, the configuration does not directly and substantially affect system performance at the system level, leading to notable performance variations. Therefore, it is classified as not performance-sensitive."
