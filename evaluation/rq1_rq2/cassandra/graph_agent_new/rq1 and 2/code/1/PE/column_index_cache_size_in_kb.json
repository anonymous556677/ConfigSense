    "Reason": "The configuration option 'column_index_cache_size_in_kb' is not performance-sensitive. The code snippet provided simply returns the column index cache size in kilobytes from the DatabaseDescriptor, which is a simple getter method. This configuration does not involve any time-expensive or memory-expensive operations within its related code. Therefore, it does not lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
