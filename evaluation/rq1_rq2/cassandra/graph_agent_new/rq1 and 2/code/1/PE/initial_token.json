    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'initial_token' configuration option is performance-sensitive. This is because the code context shows that the configuration directly affects the token generation process, which is a time-expensive operation. The presence of initial tokens or the allocation keyspace triggers different token generation mechanisms, leading to notable performance variations at the system level. The configuration involves performance-related operations that contribute significantly to execution time and memory consumption, making it performance-sensitive."
