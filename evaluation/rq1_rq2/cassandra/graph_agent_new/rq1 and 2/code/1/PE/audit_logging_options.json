    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'audit_logging_options' configuration is performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly affects the system performance by enabling or disabling audit logging, which involves time-expensive operations like creating audit loggers, initializing audit logs, and enabling audit logs. These operations contribute significantly to execution time and memory consumption at the system level. Additionally, the configuration involves setting various parameters for audit logging, which can have a notable impact on system performance based on the provided code context."
