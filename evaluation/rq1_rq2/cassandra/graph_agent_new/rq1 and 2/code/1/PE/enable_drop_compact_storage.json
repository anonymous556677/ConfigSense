    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'enable_drop_compact_storage' is performance-sensitive. This is because the code snippet related to this configuration involves operations that directly impact system performance. The code snippet checks if 'DROP COMPACT STORAGE' is enabled in the cassandra.yaml file and performs validation checks before altering the table metadata. This configuration directly affects the table storage format and can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, making it performance-sensitive."
