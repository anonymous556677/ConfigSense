    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'cached_rows_fail_threshold' is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the 'cached_rows_fail_threshold' configuration directly affects the behavior of the 'ReplicaFilteringProtection' process, which involves time-expensive operations like merging potentially out-of-date rows and querying replicas for missing data. This configuration setting influences the threshold for failing cached replica rows, which can significantly impact the performance of the system by affecting the resolution process and the completion of potentially out-of-date rows. Therefore, any changes to this configuration can lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
