    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'internode_socket_send_buffer_size_in_bytes' is performance-sensitive. The code context shows that this configuration directly affects the socket send buffer size, which can have a significant impact on network performance at the system level. Adjusting this buffer size can lead to notable performance variations in terms of network communication efficiency. Additionally, the code snippet indicates that this configuration involves a performance-related operation (setting the socket send buffer size), which is time-expensive and can impact system performance."
