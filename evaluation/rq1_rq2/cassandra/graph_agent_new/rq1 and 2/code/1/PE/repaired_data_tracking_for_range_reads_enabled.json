    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'repaired_data_tracking_for_range_reads_enabled' is performance-sensitive. The code context shows that the configuration directly affects the performance by enabling or disabling repaired data tracking for range reads. This setting impacts the execution time and memory consumption of the system, as it determines whether to request repaired data tracking info from full replicas based on the number of full replicas available. This decision can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, making it a performance-sensitive configuration."
