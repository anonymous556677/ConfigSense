    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'file_cache_size_in_mb' is performance-sensitive. The code context shows that the 'file_cache_size_in_mb' configuration directly affects the calculation of the 'cacheSize' variable, which is used to determine the maximum weight for the cache. This configuration impacts the memory consumption of the ChunkCache and can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Additionally, the 'file_cache_size_in_mb' configuration is used in conjunction with other performance-related operations like buffer allocation and cache invalidation, further emphasizing its performance sensitivity."
