    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'index_summary_resize_interval_in_minutes' is performance-sensitive. The code context provided shows that this configuration directly affects the resize interval of the index summary manager, which can have a significant impact on the system's performance. Changing this interval can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, as it influences how frequently the index summary is resized, impacting memory consumption and potentially execution time. Therefore, this configuration involves performance-related operations that are time-extensive and memory-extensive, making it performance-sensitive."
