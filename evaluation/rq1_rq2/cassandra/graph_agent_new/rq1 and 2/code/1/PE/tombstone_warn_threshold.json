    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'tombstone_warn_threshold' is not performance-sensitive. The code related to the 'tombstone_warn_threshold' configuration does not involve any performance-related operations that are time-expensive or memory-expensive. The configuration is simply retrieving the 'tombstone_warn_threshold' value from the DatabaseDescriptor, which is a constant value set at the system level. This configuration does not directly and substantially affect system performance at the system level, and it does not lead to notable performance variations."
