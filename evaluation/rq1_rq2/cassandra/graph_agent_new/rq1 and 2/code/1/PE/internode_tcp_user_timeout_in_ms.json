    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'internode_tcp_user_timeout_in_ms' is performance-sensitive. This is because the 'tcpUserTimeoutInMS' method directly returns the value of 'internode_tcp_user_timeout_in_ms' if it is not null, which indicates that this configuration directly affects the timeout value used in messaging and streaming connections. This timeout value can have a significant impact on the performance of the system, especially in scenarios where messaging and streaming connections are critical for system operations. Therefore, any changes to 'internode_tcp_user_timeout_in_ms' can lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
