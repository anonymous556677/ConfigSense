    "Reason": "The configuration option 'hints_compression' is not performance-sensitive. The code snippet provided does not contain any performance-related operations that are time-expensive or memory-expensive. The configuration related to hints compression is simply building a map of compressor parameters based on DatabaseDescriptor.getHintsCompression(), which does not directly and substantially affect system performance at the system level."
