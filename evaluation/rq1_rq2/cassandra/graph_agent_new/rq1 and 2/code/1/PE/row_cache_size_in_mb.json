    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'row_cache_size_in_mb' is performance-sensitive. This is because the 'row_cache_size_in_mb' directly affects the capacity of the row cache, which can have a significant impact on system performance. The code context shows that the row cache capacity is set based on the value of 'row_cache_size_in_mb', and this capacity directly influences the memory consumption and performance of the system. Therefore, any changes to 'row_cache_size_in_mb' can lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
