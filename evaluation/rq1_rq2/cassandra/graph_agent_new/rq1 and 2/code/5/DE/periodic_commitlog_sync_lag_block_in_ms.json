    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The configuration 'periodic_commitlog_sync_lag_block_in_ms' is used in the code to determine the number of milliseconds to block writes while waiting for a slow disk flush to complete in periodic commitlog mode. The value is converted to nanoseconds and used to calculate the expected sync time for the commit log segment.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The triggering frequency of the 'periodic_commitlog_sync_lag_block_in_ms' configuration depends on the frequency of disk flushes and the speed of the disk. If the disk flushes are slow and the system is under heavy write load, this configuration may be triggered frequently.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the 'periodic_commitlog_sync_lag_block_in_ms' configuration on the system is that it can potentially block write operations for a certain amount of time while waiting for disk flushes to complete. This can affect the overall performance and throughput of the system, especially during periods of high write activity."
