    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The configuration 'batch_size_fail_threshold_in_kb' is used to determine the maximum size in kilobytes for a multiple-partition batch before it is considered a failure.

It will be triggered whenever a multiple-partition batch exceeds the specified threshold value.",

By setting an appropriate threshold, the system can avoid processing overly large batches that may lead to timeouts or other problems."
