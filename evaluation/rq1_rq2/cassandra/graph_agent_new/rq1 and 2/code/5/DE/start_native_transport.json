If either condition is met, it starts the native transport server and sets the RPC ready flag in the StorageService instance.",

Typically, it may be triggered during the initialization of the system or when specific conditions are met.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the 'start_native_transport' configuration option is significant as it determines whether the native transport server is started or not. Starting the native transport server allows clients to connect using the native protocol, enabling communication with the Cassandra cluster. Not starting the native transport server may restrict client access and functionality."
