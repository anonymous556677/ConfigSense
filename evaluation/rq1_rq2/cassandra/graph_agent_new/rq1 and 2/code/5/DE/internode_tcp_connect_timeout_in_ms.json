    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The configuration 'internode_tcp_connect_timeout_in_ms' is used to set the amount of time to wait for internode tcp connections to establish in Cassandra. The method tcpConnectTimeoutInMS() returns the value of 'internode_tcp_connect_timeout_in_ms' if it is not null, otherwise it calls getInternodeTcpConnectTimeoutInMS() method to get the value from DatabaseDescriptor.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The triggering frequency of the 'internode_tcp_connect_timeout_in_ms' configuration depends on the network conditions and the frequency of internode tcp connections being established in the system. It is typically triggered when nodes in the Cassandra cluster need to communicate with each other.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the 'internode_tcp_connect_timeout_in_ms' configuration option on the system is related to the resilience of the Cassandra cluster against network partitions. Setting a higher timeout value may increase the time taken for internode tcp connections to establish, potentially impacting the overall performance and availability of the system. On the other hand, setting a lower timeout value may increase the risk of false positives in detecting network partitions."
