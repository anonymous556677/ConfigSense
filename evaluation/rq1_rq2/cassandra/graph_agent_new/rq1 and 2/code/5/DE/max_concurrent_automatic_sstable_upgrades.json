    "config_description": "Automatically upgrade sstables after upgrade - if there is no ordinary compaction to do, the oldest non-upgraded sstable will get upgraded to the latest version automatic_sstable_upgrade: false Limit the number of concurrent sstable upgrades",
    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The configuration 'max_concurrent_automatic_sstable_upgrades' controls the maximum number of concurrent sstable upgrade tasks that can be run automatically after an upgrade. The code snippet provided checks if there are upgrade tasks available and if the number of currently running background upgrade tasks is less than or equal to the configured maximum before executing an upgrade task.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The triggering frequency of the 'max_concurrent_automatic_sstable_upgrades' configuration depends on the availability of upgrade tasks and the current number of running background upgrade tasks. It is triggered whenever the maybeRunUpgradeTask method is called and there are upgrade tasks available for execution.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the 'max_concurrent_automatic_sstable_upgrades' configuration option on the system is that it limits the number of concurrent sstable upgrade tasks that can run automatically. This helps in controlling the system resources used for upgrade tasks and prevents potential performance issues that may arise from running too many upgrade tasks simultaneously."
