The method then calculates and returns the expiration time in nanoseconds.",

If disabled, replicas will assume that requests were forwarded instantly, potentially leading to wasted time processing already-timed-out requests under overload conditions. It is important to note that this configuration assumes that users have set up NTP on their clusters and that clocks are in sync for general correctness of last write wins."
