If you want something that high set this to 0 which picks up the OS default and configure the net.ipv4.tcp_retries2 sysctl to be ~8.",
    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The configuration 'internode_tcp_user_timeout_in_ms' is used to set the amount of time to wait for internode TCP connections to establish in Cassandra. The code snippet provided shows a method 'tcpUserTimeoutInMS' that checks if the configuration value is set, and if not, it returns the value based on the connection category (messaging or streaming) from the DatabaseDescriptor.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The triggering frequency of the 'internode_tcp_user_timeout_in_ms' configuration depends on the usage of internode TCP connections in the Cassandra system. It will be triggered whenever a new connection is established between nodes for messaging or streaming purposes.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the 'internode_tcp_user_timeout_in_ms' configuration option is crucial for protecting Cassandra from true network partitions. Setting this value appropriately can help in managing the time allowed for internode TCP connections to establish, thus ensuring smooth communication between nodes. However, setting it too high may lead to odd behavior on certain systems, as mentioned in the configuration description."
