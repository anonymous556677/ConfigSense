    "config_description": "Throttles all streaming file transfer between the datacenters, this setting allows users to throttle inter dc stream throughput in addition to throttling all network stream traffic as configured with stream_throughput_outbound_megabits_per_sec When unset, the default is 200 Mbps or 25 MB/s",
    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The configuration 'inter_dc_stream_throughput_outbound_megabits_per_sec' is used to throttle all streaming file transfer between the datacenters. It allows users to set a limit on the inter DC stream throughput, in addition to the limit set for all network stream traffic with 'stream_throughput_outbound_megabits_per_sec'. The code provided includes methods to set and get the value of this configuration, as well as a method to calculate the rate in bytes based on the configured value.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The triggering frequency of the configuration depends on when the 'setInterDCStreamThroughputMbPerSec' method is called in the code. Whenever this method is called with a new value, the configuration is updated and the 'StreamManager.StreamRateLimiter.updateInterDCThroughput()' method is invoked to apply the new throughput limit.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the 'inter_dc_stream_throughput_outbound_megabits_per_sec' configuration option is significant as it directly affects the rate at which streaming file transfer occurs between datacenters. Setting a lower value will limit the throughput, potentially slowing down data transfer between datacenters. Conversely, setting a higher value can increase the throughput but may also lead to network congestion and performance issues."
