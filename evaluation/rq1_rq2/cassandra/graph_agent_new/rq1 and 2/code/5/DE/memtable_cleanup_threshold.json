This value is used in the createMemtableAllocatorPool method to set the cleaningThreshold parameter for the MemtablePool creation.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The triggering frequency of the memtable_cleanup_threshold configuration depends on the ratio of occupied non-flushing memtable size to the total permitted size. When this ratio exceeds the configured threshold, a flush of the largest memtable is triggered.",

A higher value for this configuration will result in larger flushes and less compaction, but also less concurrent flush activity. This can make it difficult to keep disks fed under heavy write load. The default calculation for this configuration is recommended as the most reasonable choice."
