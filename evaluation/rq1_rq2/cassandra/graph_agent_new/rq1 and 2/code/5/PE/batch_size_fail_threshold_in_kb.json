    "Reason": "The configuration option 'batch_size_fail_threshold_in_kb' is not performance-sensitive. The code snippet provided simply returns the batch size failure threshold in kilobytes from the DatabaseDescriptor, which is a simple retrieval operation without any significant performance impact. This configuration does not involve any time-expensive or memory-expensive operations that would lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
