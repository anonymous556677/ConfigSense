    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'concurrent_writes' configuration is performance-sensitive. The code context provided shows that the configuration is used to determine the number of locks created for concurrent writes. The use of locks in the code indicates that there are potential concurrency issues that could impact performance. Additionally, the code contains time-expensive operations such as acquiring and releasing locks, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Therefore, based on the code context and the presence of performance-related operations, the 'concurrent_writes' configuration is classified as performance-sensitive."
