    "Reason": "The configuration option 'native_transport_flush_in_batches_legacy' does not appear to be performance-sensitive based on the provided code context. The code snippet provided does not contain any performance-related operations that are time-extensive or memory-extensive. The configuration mainly deals with setting up server parameters and initializing event notifiers, which are not directly impacting system performance at a notable level."
