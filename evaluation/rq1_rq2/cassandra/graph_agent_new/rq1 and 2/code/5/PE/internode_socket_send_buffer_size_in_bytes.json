    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'internode_socket_send_buffer_size_in_bytes' is classified as performance-sensitive. This is because the code context provided shows that this configuration directly affects the socket send buffer size, which can have a significant impact on network performance at the system level. Additionally, the code snippet suggests that this configuration can lead to notable performance variations as it involves retrieving the socket send buffer size either from a stored value or from a system-wide configuration setting, which can be time-expensive and memory-expensive operations."
