    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'key_cache_size_in_mb' is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the 'key_cache_size_in_mb' directly affects the memory consumption of the key cache, which is a critical component for performance optimization in the system. The code context shows that the 'key_cache_size_in_mb' is used to initialize the key cache with a specific capacity in MBs, and this directly impacts the memory usage of the cache. Since the key cache plays a crucial role in improving system performance by reducing read latency, any changes in its size can lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
