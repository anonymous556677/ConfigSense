    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'native_transport_max_frame_size_in_mb' is performance-sensitive. This is because the 'native_transport_max_frame_size_in_mb' configuration directly affects the maximum total length of messages that can be processed by the system. The code context shows that this configuration is used to limit the size of messages being processed, and exceeding this limit can lead to discarding messages and throwing exceptions, impacting system performance. Therefore, the configuration involves performance-related operations that are memory-expensive and can lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
