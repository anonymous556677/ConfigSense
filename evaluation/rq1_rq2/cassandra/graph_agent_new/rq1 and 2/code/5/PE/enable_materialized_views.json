    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'enable_materialized_views' is performance-sensitive. This is because the code context related to this configuration involves multiple performance-related operations that are time-expensive and memory-expensive. The configuration directly affects system performance at the system level by validating and processing various aspects of materialized views, including dependency validations, base table validations, processing SELECT clause, processing PRIMARY KEY columns, processing WHERE clause, and validating WITH params. These operations contribute significantly to the execution time and memory consumption of the system, leading to notable performance variations."
