    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'native_transport_idle_timeout_in_ms' is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the idle timeout setting directly impacts the performance of the system by closing client connections after a certain period of inactivity. This operation is time-expensive and can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The code context shows that the idle timeout is set in milliseconds and triggers the closure of client connections, which can have a significant impact on system performance, especially in high-traffic scenarios."
