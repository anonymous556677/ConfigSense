    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'flush_compression' is classified as performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the 'flush_compression' configuration directly affects system performance at the system level by determining the compression algorithm used during flush operations. The code snippet provided shows that the choice of compression algorithm can have a significant impact on the throughput of flush operations, especially for large tables. This indicates that the configuration involves performance-related operations that are time-expensive and can lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
