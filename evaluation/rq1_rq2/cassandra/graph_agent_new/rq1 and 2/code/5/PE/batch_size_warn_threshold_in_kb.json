    "Reason": "The configuration option 'batch_size_warn_threshold_in_kb' is not performance-sensitive. The code snippet provided simply retrieves the value of the configuration from the DatabaseDescriptor, without any performance-related operations that are time-expensive or memory-expensive. This configuration does not directly and substantially affect system performance at the system level, and therefore does not lead to notable performance variations."
