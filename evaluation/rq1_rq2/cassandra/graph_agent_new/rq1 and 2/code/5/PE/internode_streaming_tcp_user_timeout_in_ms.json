    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'internode_streaming_tcp_user_timeout_in_ms' is performance-sensitive. This is because the code snippet related to this configuration involves time-expensive operations that directly impact system performance. Specifically, the 'receive' method calculates the latency of processing incoming stream messages and compares it to the 'internode_streaming_tcp_user_timeout_in_ms' value. If the latency exceeds the timeout value, a warning is logged, indicating potential performance issues. Therefore, this configuration directly affects system performance and can lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
