    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'row_cache_class_name' is performance-sensitive. This is because the 'row_cache_class_name' configuration directly impacts the initialization of the row cache, which involves time-expensive operations such as initializing the cache provider class dynamically based on the configuration value. Additionally, the row cache size and save period are determined by the configuration values, which can significantly affect memory consumption and cache performance at the system level. Therefore, the configuration has notable performance implications and is classified as performance-sensitive."
