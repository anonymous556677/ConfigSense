{
    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'file_cache_enabled' is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the 'file_cache_enabled' configuration directly affects the system performance at the system level. The code context shows that the 'file_cache_enabled' configuration is used to determine whether the ChunkCache instance should be created based on the value of 'enabled'. This decision impacts the memory consumption and execution time of the system, as it determines if caching will be enabled for chunk data. Additionally, the 'file_cache_enabled' configuration involves performance-related operations such as cacheSize calculation and cache initialization, which are time-expensive and memory-expensive operations. These operations contribute significantly to the overall performance of the system, making the 'file_cache_enabled' configuration performance-sensitive."
