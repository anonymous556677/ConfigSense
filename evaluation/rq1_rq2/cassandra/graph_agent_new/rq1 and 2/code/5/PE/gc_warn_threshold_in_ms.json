    "Reason": "The configuration option 'gc_warn_threshold_in_ms' is not performance-sensitive. The code context provided does not contain any performance-related operations that are time-extensive or memory-extensive within its related code. The code snippet is mainly focused on initializing the GCInspector class and registering MBeans, which do not directly and substantially affect system performance at the system level."
