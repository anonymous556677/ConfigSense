    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'server_encryption_options' is performance-sensitive. The code related to this configuration involves operations that are time-expensive and memory-expensive, such as creating SSL contexts and validating SSL certificates. These operations directly impact system performance at the system level, leading to notable performance variations. Additionally, the configuration involves handling encryption options and setting up SSL contexts, which are critical for secure communication but can also be resource-intensive."
