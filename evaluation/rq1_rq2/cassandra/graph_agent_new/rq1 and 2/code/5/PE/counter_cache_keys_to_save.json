    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'counter_cache_keys_to_save' is performance-sensitive. This is because the 'keysToSave' variable, which is set to 'DatabaseDescriptor.getCounterCacheKeysToSave()', directly affects the scheduling of cache saves in the 'cache.scheduleSaving' method. The number of keys to save has a direct impact on the execution time and memory consumption of the cache saving process, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Additionally, the 'saveCaches' method submits cache writes based on 'DatabaseDescriptor.getCounterCacheKeysToSave()', further emphasizing the performance impact of this configuration option."
