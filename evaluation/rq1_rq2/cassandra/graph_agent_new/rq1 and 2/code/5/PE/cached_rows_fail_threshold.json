    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'cached_rows_fail_threshold' is performance-sensitive. This is because the 'cached_rows_fail_threshold' configuration directly affects the behavior of the 'ReplicaFilteringProtection' process, which involves time-expensive operations like short-read protection, merging potentially out-of-date rows, and querying silent replicas. The value of 'cached_rows_fail_threshold' determines the threshold for failing the protection mechanism, which can significantly impact the performance of the system by affecting the number of valid row results produced and the efficiency of the resolution process. Therefore, any changes to this configuration can lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
