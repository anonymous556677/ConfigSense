    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'enable_user_defined_functions' is performance-sensitive. The code context shows that this configuration directly affects the execution of user-defined functions in the system. Enabling or disabling user-defined functions can have a significant impact on system performance, especially if these functions are time-expensive or memory-expensive. Therefore, any changes to this configuration can lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
