{
    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'key_cache_save_period' is classified as performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the 'key_cache_save_period' directly affects the scheduling of cache saving operations in the 'initKeyCache' method. This operation involves time-extensive operations related to cache management, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Additionally, the 'key_cache_save_period' configuration is crucial for optimizing memory consumption and ensuring efficient cache management, making it a performance-sensitive configuration."
