    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'repair_session_space_in_mb' is performance-sensitive. This is because the 'repair_session_space_in_mb' configuration directly affects the amount of memory allocated for creating Merkle trees in the 'createMerkleTrees' method. The calculation of 'availableBytes' based on the 'repair_session_space_in_mb' value determines the memory budget for creating Merkle trees, which can have a notable impact on system performance. Additionally, the 'rangeAvailableBytes' calculation in the code snippet is directly influenced by the 'repair_session_space_in_mb' configuration, affecting the depth of the Merkle trees created. Therefore, any changes in the 'repair_session_space_in_mb' configuration can lead to significant performance variations at the system level."
