    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'enable_sasi_indexes' is not performance-sensitive. The code context provided does not contain any performance-related operations that are time-expensive or memory-expensive. The configuration check for SASI indexes being enabled in cassandra.yaml is a simple validation check and does not directly and substantially affect system performance at the system level. Therefore, it does not lead to notable performance variations and should be classified as not performance-sensitive."
