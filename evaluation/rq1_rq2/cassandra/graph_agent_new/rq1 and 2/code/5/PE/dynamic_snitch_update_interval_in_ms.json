    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'dynamic_snitch_update_interval_in_ms' is performance-sensitive. This is because the 'dynamicUpdateInterval' and 'dynamicResetInterval' values directly impact the scheduling of tasks that involve time-expensive operations (e.g., updating scores and resetting bad hosts). These operations contribute significantly to the execution time and memory consumption of the system. Additionally, changes in these intervals can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, making the configuration performance-sensitive."
