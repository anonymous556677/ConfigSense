    "Reason": "The configuration option 'stream_entire_sstables' is not performance-sensitive. The code snippet provided does not contain any performance-related operations that are time-extensive or memory-extensive. The configuration only checks if full sstable transfers are disabled or if legacy counter shards are present before deciding to stream entire sstables, which does not lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
