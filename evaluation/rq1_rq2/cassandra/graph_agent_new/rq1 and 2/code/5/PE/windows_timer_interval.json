    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'windows_timer_interval' is performance-sensitive. The code context shows that this configuration directly affects the system performance by adjusting the system timer on Windows from the default 15ms down to the minimum of 1ms. This adjustment impacts timer intervals, thread scheduling, driver interrupts, etc., which are time-expensive operations. The configuration involves performance-related operations that are time-extensive within its related code, leading to notable performance variations at the system level."
