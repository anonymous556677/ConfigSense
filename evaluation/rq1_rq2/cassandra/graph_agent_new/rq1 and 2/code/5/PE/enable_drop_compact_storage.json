    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'enable_drop_compact_storage' is performance-sensitive. This is because the code snippet related to this configuration involves time-expensive operations such as checking if 'DROP COMPACT STORAGE' is enabled in the cassandra.yaml file and validating the table before dropping compact storage. These operations can have a notable performance impact at the system level, as they involve checking flags, setting parameters, and performing validations that can affect the overall performance of the system."
