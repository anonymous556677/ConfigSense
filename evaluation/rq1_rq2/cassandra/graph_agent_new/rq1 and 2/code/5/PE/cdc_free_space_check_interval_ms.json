    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'cdc_free_space_check_interval_ms' is performance-sensitive. This is because the 'CDCSizeTracker' class, which is related to this configuration, involves performance-related operations that are time-extensive and memory-expensive. The 'CDCSizeTracker' class calculates the total disk usage of the CDC subsystem and performs size recalculation operations synchronously, which can lead to delays in new segment allocation and impact system performance. Additionally, the configuration directly affects system performance at the system level by managing disk space allocation for CDC mutations, which can have a notable performance impact."
