    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'allocate_tokens_for_keyspace' is performance-sensitive. This is because the code context involves operations that can have a notable performance impact at the system level. The allocation of tokens for a keyspace directly affects the distribution of data across the cluster, which can significantly impact system performance. Additionally, the code includes time-expensive operations such as token allocation algorithms and random token generation, which can contribute to performance variations. Therefore, the configuration is considered performance-sensitive."
