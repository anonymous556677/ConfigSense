    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'auto_snapshot' is performance-sensitive. This is because the 'auto_snapshot' configuration directly impacts system performance by triggering the creation of snapshots, which involves time-expensive and memory-expensive operations such as flushing memtables, truncating data, and managing indexes. These operations can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, affecting execution time and memory consumption significantly. The code context provided shows that the 'auto_snapshot' configuration is intertwined with various performance-related operations that have a substantial impact on system performance, making it a performance-sensitive configuration."
