    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'cached_rows_warn_threshold' is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the 'DatabaseDescriptor.getCachedReplicaRowsWarnThreshold()' method call directly affects the performance of the system by setting a threshold for caching replica rows. This threshold can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, as it determines when to cache data for potentially out-of-date rows. Additionally, the configuration-related code context shows that this threshold is used in the 'ReplicaFilteringProtection' class to control the caching behavior, which can have a significant impact on memory consumption and execution time during the resolution process."
