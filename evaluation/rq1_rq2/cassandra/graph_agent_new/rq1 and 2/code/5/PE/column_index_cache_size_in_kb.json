    "Reason": "The configuration option 'column_index_cache_size_in_kb' is not performance-sensitive. The code snippet provided simply returns the value of the column index cache size in kilobytes from the DatabaseDescriptor, which does not involve any time-expensive or memory-expensive operations. This configuration does not directly and substantially affect system performance at the system level, and therefore does not lead to notable performance variations."
