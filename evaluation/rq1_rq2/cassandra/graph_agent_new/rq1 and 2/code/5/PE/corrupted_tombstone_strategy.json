    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'corrupted_tombstone_strategy' is not performance-sensitive. The code related to this configuration does not involve any performance-related operations that are time-expensive or memory-expensive. The configuration mainly deals with handling invalid data in the context of corrupted tombstones, which does not have a direct and substantial impact on system performance at the system level. Therefore, it does not lead to notable performance variations and should be classified as not performance-sensitive."
