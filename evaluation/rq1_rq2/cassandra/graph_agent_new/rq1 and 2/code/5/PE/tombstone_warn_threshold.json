    "Reason": "The configuration option 'tombstone_warn_threshold' is not performance-sensitive. The code related to this configuration does not involve any performance-related operations that are time-expensive or memory-expensive. It is simply retrieving a system-level configuration value 'TombstoneWarnThreshold' from DatabaseDescriptor. This value is not directly involved in any operations that significantly impact system performance."
