    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'memtable_heap_space_in_mb' is performance-sensitive. This is because the value of 'heapLimit' is directly dependent on the 'memtable_heap_space_in_mb' configuration, which in turn affects the memory allocation for the MemtablePool. The 'heapLimit' value is used in memory-intensive operations within the code context, such as creating different types of MemtablePool based on the configuration. Therefore, any changes in 'memtable_heap_space_in_mb' can lead to notable performance variations at the system level due to the memory-expensive operations involved."
