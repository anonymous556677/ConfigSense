    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'index_summary_resize_interval_in_minutes' is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the 'index_summary_resize_interval_in_minutes' configuration directly affects the performance of the system by setting the interval for resizing the index summary. This interval can impact the memory consumption and execution time of the system, as it determines how often the index summary is resized. The code context shows that this configuration is used to set the resize interval for the index summary manager, which can have a significant impact on system performance at the system level."
