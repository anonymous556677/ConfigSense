    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'hinted_handoff_throttle_in_kb' is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the 'hinted_handoff_throttle_in_kb' configuration directly affects the rate at which hints are dispatched to other nodes in the cluster. The code related to this configuration involves creating a RateLimiter based on the value of 'hinted_handoff_throttle_in_kb', which controls the rate of dispatching hints. This rate limiting mechanism has a direct impact on the performance of the system by controlling the traffic going towards a particular node, ensuring that the system does not get overwhelmed with hint traffic. Therefore, any changes to 'hinted_handoff_throttle_in_kb' can lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
