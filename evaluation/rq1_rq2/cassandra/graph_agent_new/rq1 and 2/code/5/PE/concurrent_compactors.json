    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'concurrent_compactors' is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the 'concurrent_compactors' configuration directly affects the system's performance at the system level. The code context shows that the 'concurrent_compactors' value is used to set the number of concurrent compactors, which can significantly impact the system's performance by affecting the compaction process for SSTables. Since compaction is a time-expensive operation that directly impacts system performance, any changes to the 'concurrent_compactors' configuration can lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
