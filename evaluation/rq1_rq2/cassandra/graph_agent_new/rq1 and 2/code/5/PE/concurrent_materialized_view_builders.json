    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'concurrent_materialized_view_builders' is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the configuration directly affects the number of concurrent view builders, which in turn impacts the performance of compaction operations. The code context shows that the configuration is used to set the number of concurrent view builders, which can significantly affect the execution time and memory consumption of compaction tasks. Therefore, any changes to this configuration can lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
