    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'keyspace_count_warn_threshold' is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the 'keyspaceCount' variable is directly compared to the 'keyspaceCountWarnThreshold' configuration value, and if the condition is met, a warning message is logged. This warning message indicates that having a large number of keyspaces will significantly slow down schema-dependent cluster operations. This directly impacts system performance at the system level by potentially causing notable performance variations due to the increased number of keyspaces. Therefore, the configuration is considered performance-sensitive."
