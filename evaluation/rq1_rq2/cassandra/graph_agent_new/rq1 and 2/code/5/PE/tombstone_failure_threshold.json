    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'tombstone_failure_threshold' is not performance-sensitive. The code related to this configuration does not contain any performance-related operations that are time-expensive or memory-expensive. The configuration is used to retrieve a system-level setting 'Tombstone Failure Threshold' from the DatabaseDescriptor, which is a constant value used for internal system operations. It does not directly and substantially affect system performance at the system level, and it does not lead to notable performance variations."
