    "Reason": "The configuration option 'index_summary_capacity_in_mb' is performance-sensitive. The code snippet provided shows that the configuration directly affects the memory pool size of the index summary manager, which can have a substantial impact on system performance. Setting the memory pool capacity in MB based on this configuration can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, making it performance-sensitive."
