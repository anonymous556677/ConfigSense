{
    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'sstable_preemptive_open_interval_in_mb' is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the 'calculateOpenInterval' method directly uses the 'DatabaseDescriptor.getSSTablePreemptiveOpenIntervalInMB()' configuration value to calculate the interval, which can have a significant impact on the execution time. Additionally, the method returns a value that can be Long.MAX_VALUE under certain conditions, indicating that the configuration plays a crucial role in determining the system performance. Therefore, the configuration involves performance-related operations that are time-extensive and can lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
