    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'table_count_warn_threshold' is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the 'tableCount' variable is directly dependent on the 'tableCountWarnThreshold()' method from the 'DatabaseDescriptor' class. If the 'tableCount' exceeds the threshold set by 'tableCountWarnThreshold()', it triggers a warning message that indicates a potential performance impact due to having a large number of tables. This warning message suggests that having a high number of tables can significantly slow down schema-dependent cluster operations, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Therefore, the configuration directly and substantially affects system performance by influencing the behavior of the system based on the number of tables, making it performance-sensitive."
