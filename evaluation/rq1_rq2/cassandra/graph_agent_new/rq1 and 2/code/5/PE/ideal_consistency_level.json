    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'ideal_consistency_level' is performance-sensitive. This is because the 'ideal_consistency_level' configuration directly affects the performance of the system by tracking the ideal consistency level for write operations. The code context shows that the 'ideal_consistency_level' is used to construct response handlers based on the consistency level requested, which can have a notable impact on the performance of the system. Additionally, setting and updating the 'ideal_consistency_level' involves time-expensive operations like converting the consistency level to uppercase and updating the DatabaseDescriptor, which can lead to significant performance variations at the system level."
