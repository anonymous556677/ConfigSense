    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'dynamic_snitch_reset_interval_in_ms' is performance-sensitive. This is because the 'dynamicResetInterval' configuration parameter directly affects the scheduling of the 'reset' task in the 'DynamicEndpointSnitch' class. The 'reset' task is scheduled to run at fixed intervals based on the 'dynamicResetInterval' value, which can have a notable impact on system performance. Any changes to this configuration parameter can lead to significant performance variations at the system level, making it a performance-sensitive configuration."
