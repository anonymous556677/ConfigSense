    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'diagnostic_events_enabled' is performance-sensitive. The code context provided shows that the 'diagnostic_events_enabled' configuration directly affects the execution of diagnostic events by checking if events are enabled before publishing them. This check is time-expensive as it involves multiple conditional statements and method calls. Additionally, the 'diagnostic_events_enabled' configuration is used in multiple methods within the code, indicating that it has a substantial impact on the performance of the system at the system level."
