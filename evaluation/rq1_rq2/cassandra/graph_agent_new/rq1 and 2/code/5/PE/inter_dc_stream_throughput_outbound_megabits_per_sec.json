{
    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'inter_dc_stream_throughput_outbound_megabits_per_sec' is performance-sensitive. This is because the code context provided shows that this configuration directly affects the inter-DC stream throughput in bytes, which is a critical performance-related operation. The 'calculateInterDCRateInBytes' method calculates the inter-DC rate in bytes based on this configuration, showing that changes in 'inter_dc_stream_throughput_outbound_megabits_per_sec' will have a notable impact on system performance. Additionally, the 'setInterDCStreamThroughputMbPerSec' method updates the throughput and triggers a stream rate limiter, further emphasizing the performance sensitivity of this configuration."
