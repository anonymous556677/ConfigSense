    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'partitioner' configuration option is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the 'partitioner' directly affects the system performance at the system level. The 'partitioner' configuration involves performance-related operations that are time-extensive and memory-extensive within its related code. The 'partitioner' configuration impacts the system performance significantly by determining how data is distributed and accessed, which can lead to notable performance variations."
