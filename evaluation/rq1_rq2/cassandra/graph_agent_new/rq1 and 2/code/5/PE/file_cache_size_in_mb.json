    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'file_cache_size_in_mb' configuration option is performance-sensitive. The code context shows that the 'file_cache_size_in_mb' configuration directly affects the calculation of the 'cacheSize' variable, which is used to determine the size of the cache in the 'ChunkCache' class. The 'cacheSize' variable is a crucial parameter that impacts the memory consumption of the cache, and any changes to 'file_cache_size_in_mb' will have a direct and substantial effect on the system performance at the memory level. Additionally, the 'cacheSize' variable is used in various operations within the 'ChunkCache' class, such as in the 'maximumWeight' setting of the cache, indicating that this configuration has a significant impact on the overall performance of the system."
