    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option cdc_total_space_in_mb is performance-sensitive. The code context provided shows that this configuration directly affects the amount of space allocated for Change Data Capture (CDC) in megabytes. Increasing or decreasing this value can have a significant impact on memory consumption at the system level, as it determines the amount of memory reserved for CDC operations. Since memory consumption is a critical factor in system performance, any changes to this configuration can lead to notable performance variations. Therefore, this configuration is considered performance-sensitive."
