    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'internode_application_receive_queue_capacity_in_bytes' is performance-sensitive. This is because the 'applicationReceiveQueueCapacityInBytes' configuration directly affects the capacity of the application receive queue, which is crucial for handling inbound messages in the MessagingService. The code context shows that this configuration is checked for validity and has a minimum size requirement, indicating its importance in the system's performance. Additionally, the configuration is used in various parts of the code to set the application receive queue capacity, which can have a significant impact on memory consumption and message processing efficiency at the system level."
