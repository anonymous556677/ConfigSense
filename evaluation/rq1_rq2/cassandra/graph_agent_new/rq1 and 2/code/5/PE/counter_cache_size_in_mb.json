    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'counter_cache_size_in_mb' is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the 'counter_cache_size_in_mb' directly affects the capacity of the counter cache, which in turn impacts the memory consumption of the system. The code snippet provided shows that the size of the cache is initialized based on this configuration, and a larger cache size can lead to increased memory usage. Additionally, the 'counter_cache_size_in_mb' configuration involves time-expensive operations such as cache initialization and scheduling, which can have a notable performance impact at the system level."
