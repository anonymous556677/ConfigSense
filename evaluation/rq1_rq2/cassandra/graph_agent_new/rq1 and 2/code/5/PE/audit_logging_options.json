    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'audit_logging_options' configuration is performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly affects the system performance by enabling or disabling audit logging, which involves time-expensive operations such as creating audit logs, setting log paths, and managing log sizes. The code snippets related to the 'audit_logging_options' configuration show that it can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, as it involves operations that contribute significantly to execution time and memory consumption."
