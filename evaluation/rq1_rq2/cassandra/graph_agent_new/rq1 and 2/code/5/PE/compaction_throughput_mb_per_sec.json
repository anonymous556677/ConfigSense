    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'compaction_throughput_mb_per_sec' is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the 'compaction_throughput_mb_per_sec' configuration directly affects the rate limiter for compaction operations in the system. The code context shows that this configuration is used to set the rate limit for compaction operations, which are time-expensive operations that can significantly impact system performance. Therefore, any changes to this configuration can lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
