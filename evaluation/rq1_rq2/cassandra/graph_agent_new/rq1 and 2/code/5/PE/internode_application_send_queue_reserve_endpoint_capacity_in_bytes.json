    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'internode_application_send_queue_reserve_endpoint_capacity_in_bytes' is performance-sensitive. This is because the code context shows that this configuration directly impacts the application's send queue reserve endpoint capacity in bytes, which can have a notable performance variation at the system level. The configuration involves performance-related operations such as setting the applicationReserveSendQueueEndpointCapacityInBytes based on DatabaseDescriptor.getInternodeApplicationSendQueueReserveEndpointCapacityInBytes() and MessagingService.instance().outboundGlobalReserveLimit, which can be time-expensive and memory-expensive, leading to significant performance impacts."
