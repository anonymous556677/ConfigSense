    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'streaming_keep_alive_period_in_secs' is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the value of 'streaming_keep_alive_period_in_secs' directly influences the frequency of keep-alive tasks scheduled in the 'scheduleKeepAliveTask' method. The 'scheduleAtFixedRate' method is time-expensive and its frequency is determined by the value of 'streaming_keep_alive_period_in_secs'. Therefore, changing this configuration can lead to notable performance variations at the system level by affecting the frequency of keep-alive tasks, which can impact system resources and overall performance."
