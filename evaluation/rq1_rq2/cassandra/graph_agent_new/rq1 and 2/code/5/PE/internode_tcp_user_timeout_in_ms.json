    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'internode_tcp_user_timeout_in_ms' is performance-sensitive. This is because the 'tcpUserTimeoutInMS' method directly impacts the system performance by returning different values based on the 'category' parameter. Depending on the category (MESSAGING or STREAMING), the method calls 'getInternodeTcpUserTimeoutInMS' or 'getInternodeStreamingTcpUserTimeoutInMS' from the 'DatabaseDescriptor' class, which can have notable performance variations at the system level. Therefore, the configuration involves performance-related operations that are time-expensive and memory-expensive, making it performance-sensitive."
