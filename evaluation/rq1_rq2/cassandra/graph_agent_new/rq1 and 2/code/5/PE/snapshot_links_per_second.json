    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'snapshot_links_per_second' is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the 'snapshot_links_per_second' configuration directly affects the rate at which snapshots are taken in the system, which can have a significant impact on system performance. The code context shows that this configuration is used to create a RateLimiter, which implies that it is related to controlling the rate of a certain operation. Since the rate at which snapshots are taken can be a time-expensive operation, any changes in the 'snapshot_links_per_second' configuration can lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
