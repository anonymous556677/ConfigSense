    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'repaired_data_tracking_for_range_reads_enabled' is performance-sensitive. The code context shows that the configuration directly affects the performance of the system by enabling or disabling data tracking for range reads. This can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, especially when there are multiple full replicas to compare results from. The configuration involves performance-related operations such as filtering full replicas and tracking repaired status, which are time-expensive and memory-expensive. Therefore, the configuration is considered performance-sensitive based on its impact on system performance and the performance-related operations within the code."
