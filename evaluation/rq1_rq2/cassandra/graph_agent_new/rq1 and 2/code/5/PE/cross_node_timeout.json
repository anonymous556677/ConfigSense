    "Reason": "The configuration option 'cross_node_timeout' is not performance-sensitive. The code snippet provided does not involve any performance-related operations that are time-extensive or memory-extensive. The 'cross_node_timeout' configuration is only used in a simple conditional check and assignment operation, which does not lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Therefore, it does not directly and substantially affect system performance, making it non-performance-sensitive."
