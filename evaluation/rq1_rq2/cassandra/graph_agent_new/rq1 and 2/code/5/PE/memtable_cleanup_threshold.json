{
    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'memtable_cleanup_threshold' is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the 'cleaningThreshold' parameter directly influences the behavior of the MemtablePool creation process. The value of 'cleaningThreshold' affects the memory usage and cleanup frequency of memtables, which can have a significant impact on system performance. Additionally, the 'cleaningThreshold' parameter is used in conjunction with other performance-related operations such as 'flushLargestMemtable' and memory allocation strategies based on the 'MemtableAllocationType'. These factors combined indicate that the 'memtable_cleanup_threshold' configuration is performance-sensitive and can lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
