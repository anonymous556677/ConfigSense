    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'enable_scripted_user_defined_functions' is performance-sensitive. This is because the code snippet related to this configuration directly checks if 'enable_scripted_user_defined_functions' is set to true before allowing the execution of scripted user-defined functions. This check involves a performance-related operation that can have a notable impact on system performance. Additionally, enabling scripted user-defined functions can introduce security risks, which further emphasizes the importance of this configuration being performance-sensitive."
