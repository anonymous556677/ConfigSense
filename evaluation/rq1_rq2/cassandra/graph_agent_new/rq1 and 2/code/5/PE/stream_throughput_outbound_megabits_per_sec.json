    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'stream_throughput_outbound_megabits_per_sec' is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the 'stream_throughput_outbound_megabits_per_sec' configuration directly affects the system's performance by setting the outbound throughput for streams. The code context provided shows that this configuration is used to calculate the rate in bytes for stream throughput, which can have a significant impact on system performance. Additionally, the 'setStreamThroughputMbPerSec' method updates the throughput and triggers a stream rate limiter, indicating that changes in this configuration can lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
