    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'internode_compression' does not appear to be performance-sensitive based on the provided code context. The code snippet only checks the value of 'DatabaseDescriptor.internodeCompression()' and returns a boolean based on the comparison. This operation does not involve any time-expensive or memory-expensive operations that would lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Additionally, the configuration-related code does not directly and substantially affect system performance, as it simply checks a configuration value and returns a boolean result."
