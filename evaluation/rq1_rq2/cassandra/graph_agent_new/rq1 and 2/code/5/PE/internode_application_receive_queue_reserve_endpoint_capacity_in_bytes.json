    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'internode_application_receive_queue_reserve_endpoint_capacity_in_bytes' is performance-sensitive. This is because it directly affects the capacity of the application receive queue at the endpoint level, which can impact the overall system performance. The code context shows that this configuration is used to determine the capacity of the inbound message queue, which is crucial for handling incoming messages efficiently. Any changes to this configuration can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, especially in scenarios where there is a high volume of incoming messages."
