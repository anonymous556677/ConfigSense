    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'memtable_offheap_space_in_mb' is performance-sensitive. This is because the value of 'offHeapLimit' directly affects the memory allocation for memtables, which can have a significant impact on system performance. The code snippet shows that the 'offHeapLimit' is used to set the off-heap space for memtables, and this allocation can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, making it a performance-sensitive configuration."
