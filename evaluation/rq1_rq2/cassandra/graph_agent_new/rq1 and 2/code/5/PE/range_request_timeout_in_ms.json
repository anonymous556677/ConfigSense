    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'range_request_timeout_in_ms' is performance-sensitive. This is because the 'getRangeRpcTimeout' method directly affects system performance by retrieving the range RPC timeout value from the DatabaseDescriptor, which is a time-expensive operation. The method is called multiple times within the code context provided, indicating that changes to this configuration can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Additionally, the 'getRangeRpcTimeout' method is used in critical code paths such as index building and timeout calculation, further emphasizing its performance sensitivity."
