    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'network_authorizer' configuration is performance-sensitive. This is because it directly affects system performance at the system level by involving time-expensive and memory-expensive operations within its related code. The 'network_authorizer' configuration is used to set role datacenters and perform authorization checks, which can have a notable impact on system performance. Additionally, the code context shows that the configuration is tightly coupled with the authentication and authorization processes, which are critical for system security and performance."
