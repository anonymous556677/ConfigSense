    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'initial_token' configuration option is performance-sensitive. This is because the 'initial_tokens' configuration involves performance-related operations that directly impact system performance at the system level. The code snippet provided shows that the 'initial_tokens' configuration option is used to generate suitable tokens for bootstrap operations, which can have a notable performance variation. The code also checks for user-specified tokens and handles different scenarios based on the configuration, indicating that it plays a crucial role in the performance of the system."
