    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'allocate_tokens_for_local_replication_factor' is performance-sensitive. This is because the code context shows that the configuration involves operations that allocate tokens based on specified keyspace or local replication factor, which can have a direct impact on system performance. The allocation of tokens and generation of suitable tokens are time-expensive operations that can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Additionally, the configuration directly affects the distribution of data across the cluster, which is crucial for system performance."
