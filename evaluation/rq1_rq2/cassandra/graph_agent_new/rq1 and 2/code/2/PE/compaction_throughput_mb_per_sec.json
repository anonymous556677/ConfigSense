    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'compaction_throughput_mb_per_sec' is performance-sensitive. This is because the 'compactionThroughputMbPerSec' configuration directly affects the rate limiter for compaction, which is a critical operation for system performance. The code context shows that this configuration is used to set the rate limit for compaction, indicating that it plays a significant role in controlling the performance of compaction operations. Therefore, any changes to this configuration can lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
