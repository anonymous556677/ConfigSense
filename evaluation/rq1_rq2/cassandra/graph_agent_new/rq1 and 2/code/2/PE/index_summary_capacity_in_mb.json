    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'index_summary_capacity_in_mb' is performance-sensitive. The code context shows that the configuration directly affects the memory pool size and resize interval of the index summary manager, which can have a significant impact on system performance. The use of 'DatabaseDescriptor.getIndexSummaryCapacityInMB()' and 'DatabaseDescriptor.getIndexSummaryResizeIntervalInMinutes()' indicates that these values are crucial for the performance of the system. Any changes to these values can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, making this configuration performance-sensitive."
