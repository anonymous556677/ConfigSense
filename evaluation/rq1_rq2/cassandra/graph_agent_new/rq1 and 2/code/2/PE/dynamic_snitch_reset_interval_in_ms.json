    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'dynamic_snitch_reset_interval_in_ms' is performance-sensitive. This is because the 'dynamicResetInterval' configuration directly affects the scheduling of the 'reset' task, which is time-expensive and memory-expensive. The 'reset' task is scheduled with a fixed delay using the 'dynamicResetInterval' value, and any change in this value will directly impact the frequency of the 'reset' task execution. This can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, making it a performance-sensitive configuration."
