    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'cas_contention_timeout_in_ms' is performance-sensitive. The code context provided shows that this configuration directly affects the timeout duration for Paxos rounds, which are critical for system performance. The 'doPaxos' method uses this configuration to calculate the timeout for Paxos rounds, which can significantly impact the overall system performance. Additionally, the 'beginAndRepairPaxos' method also utilizes this configuration to determine the timeout for preparing and completing in-progress requests, further emphasizing its performance sensitivity. Therefore, based on the code context and the critical role of this configuration in Paxos operations, it can be classified as performance-sensitive."
