    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'enable_materialized_views' does not directly involve any performance-related operations that are time-expensive or memory-expensive within its related code. The code context provided mainly focuses on validation and processing logic for creating materialized views in Cassandra. While the configuration may impact the behavior of materialized views, it does not lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Therefore, based on the analysis of the configuration-related code, it is classified as not performance-sensitive."
