    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'internode_application_receive_queue_reserve_endpoint_capacity_in_bytes' is performance-sensitive. This is because it directly affects the capacity of the application's receive queue for internode communication, which can impact the system's performance at the system level. The code context shows that this configuration is used to determine the endpoint capacity in bytes for the application's receive queue, which is crucial for handling inbound messages efficiently. Any changes to this configuration can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, making it performance-sensitive."
