    "Reason": "The 'full_query_logging_options' configuration does not involve any performance-related operations that are time-expensive or memory-expensive within its related code. The code snippet provided mainly deals with setting and getting options for full query logging, which does not have a direct and substantial impact on system performance at the system level. Therefore, the configuration is not considered performance-sensitive."
