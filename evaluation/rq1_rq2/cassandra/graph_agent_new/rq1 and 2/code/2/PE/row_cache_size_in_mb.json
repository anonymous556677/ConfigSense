    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'row_cache_size_in_mb' is performance-sensitive because it directly affects the system performance at the system level. The code context shows that the 'row_cache_size_in_mb' configuration is used to set the capacity of the row cache, which can have a significant impact on memory consumption and execution time. The code snippets demonstrate that the configuration is involved in time-extensive and memory-extensive operations, such as initializing the row cache with a specific capacity in MBs. This can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, making it a performance-sensitive configuration."
