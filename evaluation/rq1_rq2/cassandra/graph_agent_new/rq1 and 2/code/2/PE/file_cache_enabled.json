    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'file_cache_enabled' is performance-sensitive. The 'file_cache_enabled' configuration directly affects the system performance at the system level by enabling or disabling the ChunkCache, which has a significant impact on memory consumption and execution time. The code context shows that the 'enabled' variable is set based on 'DatabaseDescriptor.getFileCacheEnabled()' and 'cacheSize > 0', indicating that the configuration controls the creation of the ChunkCache instance. This ChunkCache instance is crucial for caching chunks and improving data access performance. Therefore, enabling or disabling the file cache can lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
