    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'streaming_keep_alive_period_in_secs' is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the value of 'streaming_keep_alive_period_in_secs' directly impacts the keep-alive task scheduling in the code. The value of this configuration affects the frequency at which the keep-alive task is scheduled, which can have a notable performance impact on the system level. A smaller value may lead to more frequent keep-alive tasks, increasing resource consumption, while a larger value may result in longer intervals between keep-alive tasks, potentially affecting system responsiveness. Therefore, any changes to this configuration can significantly impact system performance, making it performance-sensitive."
