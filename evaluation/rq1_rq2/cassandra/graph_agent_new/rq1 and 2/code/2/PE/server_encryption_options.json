    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'server_encryption_options' configuration option is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the configuration involves operations related to SSL encryption, which are time-expensive and memory-expensive. The code context shows that the configuration handles SSL context creation, key manager factory initialization, and SSL certificate validation, all of which are critical for secure communication but can have a notable impact on system performance due to the resource-intensive nature of SSL operations. Therefore, any changes or optimizations to this configuration can directly and substantially affect system performance at the system level."
