    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'file_cache_size_in_mb' is performance-sensitive. The code context shows that the 'file_cache_size_in_mb' configuration directly affects the calculation of the cache size in the ChunkCache class. The cache size calculation is based on this configuration value and has a significant impact on memory consumption and cache utilization. Any changes in 'file_cache_size_in_mb' will directly impact the cache size, which in turn affects the overall system performance at the system level by influencing memory usage and cache efficiency."
