    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'ideal_consistency_level' is performance-sensitive. This is because the 'ideal_consistency_level' configuration directly affects the performance of the system by tracking and setting the ideal consistency level for write operations. The code context shows that the 'ideal_consistency_level' configuration is used to construct response handlers based on the ideal consistency level, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Additionally, the code snippet includes time-expensive operations such as constructing response handlers based on the ideal consistency level, which further confirms the performance sensitivity of this configuration."
