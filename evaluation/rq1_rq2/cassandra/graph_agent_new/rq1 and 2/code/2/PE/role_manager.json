    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The 'role_manager' configuration does not involve any performance-sensitive operations that would lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The code context primarily focuses on authentication, authorization, and role management functionalities, which do not directly impact system performance in a significant way. While these operations are essential for security and access control, they are not time-expensive or memory-expensive operations that would classify the configuration as performance-sensitive."
