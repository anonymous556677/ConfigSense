    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'num_tokens' is performance-sensitive. The code context reveals that the configuration directly impacts the replication strategy and token allocation, which are critical components affecting system performance. The 'getNumTokens()' method is called multiple times within performance-related operations, such as validating replication factor, generating bootstrap tokens, and estimating results per range. These operations are time-expensive and memory-expensive, leading to notable performance variations at the system level. Therefore, the configuration 'num_tokens' is considered performance-sensitive."
