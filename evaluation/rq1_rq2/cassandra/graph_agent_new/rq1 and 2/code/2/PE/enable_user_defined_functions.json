    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'enable_user_defined_functions' is performance-sensitive. This is because the 'enableUserDefinedFunctions()' method is called in the code context, which directly checks if user-defined functions are enabled in the cassandra.yaml configuration file. Enabling user-defined functions can introduce additional time-expensive and memory-expensive operations in the system, leading to notable performance variations at the system level. Therefore, any changes to this configuration can have a substantial impact on system performance."
