    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'concurrent_materialized_view_builders' is performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly affects the number of concurrent view builders, which can impact the system's performance at the system level. The code context reveals that the configuration controls the number of concurrent view builders, which are essential for managing ongoing compactions and other tasks related to view building. Since the number of concurrent view builders can significantly impact the system's performance by affecting compaction and validation tasks, this configuration is considered performance-sensitive."
