    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'enable_transient_replication' is performance-sensitive. This is because the code related to this configuration involves operations that directly impact system performance, such as checking if transient replication is enabled and throwing exceptions based on the configuration settings. The presence of 'DatabaseDescriptor.isTransientReplicationEnabled()' and 'DatabaseDescriptor.getNumTokens()' in the code indicates that this configuration can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, making it performance-sensitive."
