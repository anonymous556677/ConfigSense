{
    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'repair_session_space_in_mb' is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the 'repair_session_space_in_mb' configuration directly affects the amount of memory allocated for creating MerkleTrees in the 'createMerkleTrees' method. The calculation of 'availableBytes' based on 'DatabaseDescriptor.getRepairSessionSpaceInMegabytes()' and the subsequent allocation of memory for each range of tokens can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The memory-intensive operations involved in creating and managing MerkleTrees can have a significant impact on system performance, making this configuration performance-sensitive."
