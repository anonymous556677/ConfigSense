    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'stream_throughput_outbound_megabits_per_sec' is performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly affects the throughput of outbound data streams, which can have a significant impact on system performance. The code context shows that changing the value of this configuration triggers the update of the stream throughput and rate limiting mechanisms, indicating that it plays a crucial role in managing system resources. Additionally, the 'calculateRateInBytes' method demonstrates that the configuration value directly influences the calculation of data transfer rates, further emphasizing its performance sensitivity."
