    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'repaired_data_tracking_for_range_reads_enabled' is performance-sensitive. The code context shows that this configuration directly affects the performance by enabling or disabling data tracking for range reads. This setting impacts the behavior of the query method, specifically in the 'query' function where it checks if 'repairedDataTrackingForRangeReadsEnabled' is enabled and then decides whether to request repaired data tracking info from full replicas. This decision affects the execution time and memory consumption of the system, leading to notable performance variations at the system level."
