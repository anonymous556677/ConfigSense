    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'disk_failure_policy' is not performance-sensitive. The code related to this configuration does not involve any performance-related operations that are time-extensive or memory-extensive. The switch cases in the code handle different disk failure policies but do not have a significant impact on system performance. Additionally, the code does not show any notable performance variations at the system level that would classify this configuration as performance-sensitive."
