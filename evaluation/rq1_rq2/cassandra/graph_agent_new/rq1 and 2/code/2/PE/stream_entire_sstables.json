    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'stream_entire_sstables' is performance-sensitive. The code context provided shows that this configuration directly impacts the decision to stream entire SSTables based on certain conditions. Streaming entire SSTables can be a time-expensive operation, especially if there are large SSTables involved. This can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, making it performance-sensitive. The code snippet also indicates that the decision is based on DatabaseDescriptor settings and specific metadata checks, which are performance-related operations contributing to execution time."
