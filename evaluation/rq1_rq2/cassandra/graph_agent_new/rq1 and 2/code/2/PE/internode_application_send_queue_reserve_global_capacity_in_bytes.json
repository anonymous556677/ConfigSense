    "Reason": "The configuration option 'internode_application_send_queue_reserve_global_capacity_in_bytes' is not performance-sensitive. The code context provided does not show any performance-related operations that are time-expensive or memory-expensive within its related code. Additionally, the configuration does not directly and substantially affect system performance at the system level. Therefore, it is classified as not performance-sensitive."
