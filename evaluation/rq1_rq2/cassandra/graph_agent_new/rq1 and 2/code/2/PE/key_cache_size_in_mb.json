    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'key_cache_size_in_mb' is performance-sensitive. This is because the 'key_cache_size_in_mb' directly affects the capacity of the key cache, which in turn impacts the memory consumption of the system. The code snippet provided shows that the key cache size in MB is used to initialize the key cache with a specific capacity. This capacity directly affects the memory usage of the system, making it a performance-sensitive configuration. Additionally, the key cache size is used in memory-intensive operations like calculating the memory capacity in bytes, which further emphasizes its performance impact."
