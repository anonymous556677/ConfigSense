{
    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'keyspace_count_warn_threshold' is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the 'keyspaceCount' variable is directly dependent on the value of 'keyspaceCountWarnThreshold()' method from DatabaseDescriptor. If the 'keyspaceCount' exceeds the threshold set by 'keyspaceCountWarnThreshold()', it triggers a warning message that indicates a potential slowdown in schema-dependent cluster operations. This configuration directly affects system performance by impacting the execution time and memory consumption of the program, making it performance-sensitive."
