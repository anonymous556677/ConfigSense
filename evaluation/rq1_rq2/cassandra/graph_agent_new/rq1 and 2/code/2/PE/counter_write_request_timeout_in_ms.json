    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'counter_write_request_timeout_in_ms' is performance-sensitive. This is because the 'counter_write_request_timeout_in_ms' configuration directly affects the timeout values for counter write requests in the system, which can have a substantial impact on system performance. The code context provided shows that this configuration is used in various methods to determine timeout values for different types of write requests. These timeout values can significantly impact the execution time of write operations, making this configuration performance-sensitive."
