    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'internode_socket_send_buffer_size_in_bytes' is performance-sensitive. The code context shows that this configuration directly impacts the size of the socket send buffer, which can have a significant impact on network performance at the system level. The size of the socket send buffer can affect the efficiency of data transmission between nodes, leading to notable performance variations. Additionally, the code snippet suggests that this configuration involves performance-related operations related to network communication, which are time-expensive and can contribute to significant performance impacts."
