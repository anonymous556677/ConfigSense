    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'internode_tcp_user_timeout_in_ms' is not performance-sensitive. The code context provided shows that the configuration is simply returning values from DatabaseDescriptor, which is a configuration management class. The configuration-related code does not involve any performance-intensive operations that would lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Therefore, the configuration is not considered performance-sensitive."
