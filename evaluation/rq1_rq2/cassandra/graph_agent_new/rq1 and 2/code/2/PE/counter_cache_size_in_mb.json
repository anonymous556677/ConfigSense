    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'counter_cache_size_in_mb' is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the 'counter_cache_size_in_mb' directly affects the capacity of the counter cache, which in turn impacts the memory consumption of the system. The code snippet provided shows that the size of the cache is calculated based on this configuration option, and a large cache size can lead to increased memory usage. Additionally, the scheduling of cache saves and the frequency of these saves are also dependent on this configuration, which can impact the overall performance of the system by affecting the efficiency of cache operations."
