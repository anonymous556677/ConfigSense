    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'audit_logging_options' configuration is performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly affects the system performance by enabling or disabling audit logging, which involves time-expensive operations such as creating audit loggers, initializing audit logs, and enabling audit logs with various parameters. These operations can have a notable impact on system performance, especially when audit logging is enabled with a large number of keyspaces, categories, and users. Additionally, the configuration-related code contains multiple operations that contribute to execution time and memory consumption, such as creating audit loggers, initializing audit logs, and setting various audit log options, which can lead to significant performance variations at the system level."
