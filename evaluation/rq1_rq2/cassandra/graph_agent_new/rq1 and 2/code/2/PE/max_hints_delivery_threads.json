    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'max_hints_delivery_threads' is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the 'maxDeliveryThreads' variable directly affects the number of threads used for delivering hints in the 'HintsDispatchExecutor' class. This configuration involves performance-related operations that are time-extensive (thread creation and management) and can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, especially when the number of threads is increased. Therefore, changes in 'max_hints_delivery_threads' can have a substantial impact on system performance."
