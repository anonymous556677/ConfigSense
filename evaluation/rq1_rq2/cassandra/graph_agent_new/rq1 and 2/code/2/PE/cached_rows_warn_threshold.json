    "Reason": "The configuration option 'cached_rows_warn_threshold' is not performance-sensitive. The code snippet provided does not show any direct and substantial impact on system performance at the system level. The configuration is simply used as a parameter in the 'ReplicaFilteringProtection' class instantiation, and its value is obtained from 'DatabaseDescriptor.getCachedReplicaRowsWarnThreshold()'. This configuration does not involve any time-extensive or memory-extensive operations that lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
