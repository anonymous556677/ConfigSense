    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'table_count_warn_threshold' is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the 'tableCount' variable is directly dependent on the 'tableCountWarnThreshold()' method from DatabaseDescriptor, which determines the threshold for the number of tables in the cluster. If the 'tableCount' exceeds this threshold, a warning message is logged, indicating that having a large number of tables will significantly slow down schema-dependent cluster operations. This configuration directly affects system performance by potentially causing significant performance variations at the system level, making it performance-sensitive."
