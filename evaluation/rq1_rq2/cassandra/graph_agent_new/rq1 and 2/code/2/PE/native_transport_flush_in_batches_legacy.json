    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'native_transport_flush_in_batches_legacy' does not appear to be performance-sensitive based on the provided code context. The code snippet mainly focuses on setting up server components and registering event notifiers, without involving any performance-intensive operations that would lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The configuration does not directly and substantially affect system performance, and there are no time-extensive or memory-extensive operations within its related code that would classify it as performance-sensitive."
