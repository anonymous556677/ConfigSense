    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'tracetype_query_ttl' is performance-sensitive. This is because the 'Tracing' class contains methods and data structures that directly impact system performance. For example, the 'TTLS' array within the 'TraceType' enum is used to store TTL values, which can affect memory consumption. Additionally, methods like 'newSession' and 'traceOutgoingMessage' involve operations that contribute to execution time. These time-expensive and memory-expensive operations within the configuration-related code lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
