    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'dynamic_snitch_update_interval_in_ms' is performance-sensitive. This is because the 'dynamicUpdateInterval' and 'dynamicResetInterval' values are used to schedule tasks that update scores and reset bad hosts, which are time-expensive operations. These tasks are scheduled at fixed intervals and directly impact system performance by affecting how often scores are updated and bad hosts are reset. Therefore, changes in these intervals can lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
