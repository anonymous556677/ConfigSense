    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'inter_dc_tcp_nodelay' is classified as performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the code context provided shows that the configuration directly affects the TCP no delay setting based on whether the communication is within the local data center or between data centers. This setting can have a significant impact on network performance, especially for inter-data center communication, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Therefore, the configuration involves performance-related operations that are time-extensive and can directly and substantially affect system performance."
