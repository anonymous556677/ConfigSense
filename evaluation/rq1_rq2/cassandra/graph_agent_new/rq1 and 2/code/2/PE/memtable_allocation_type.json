    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'memtable_allocation_type' is performance-sensitive. This is because the 'memtable_allocation_type' directly determines the type of MemtablePool created, which in turn affects the allocation and management of memory for memtables. The switch statement based on 'DatabaseDescriptor.getMemtableAllocationType()' involves performance-related operations that allocate memory and choose the appropriate MemtablePool implementation based on the allocation type. Different MemtablePool implementations have different memory allocation strategies and can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Therefore, the 'memtable_allocation_type' configuration is considered performance-sensitive."
