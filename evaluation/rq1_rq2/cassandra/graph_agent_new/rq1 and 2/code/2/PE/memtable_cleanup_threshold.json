    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'memtable_cleanup_threshold' is performance-sensitive. This is because the 'cleaningThreshold' value directly impacts the memory usage and cleanup process of memtables, which are critical for performance optimization in a database system. The 'cleaningThreshold' value is used to determine when to trigger the cleanup process for memtables, which can have a significant impact on system performance by affecting memory consumption and the efficiency of data flushing. Therefore, any changes to the 'memtable_cleanup_threshold' configuration can lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
