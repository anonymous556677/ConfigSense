{
    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'cdc_free_space_check_interval_ms' is performance-sensitive. This is because the 'CDCSizeTracker' class within the 'CommitLogSegmentManagerCDC' class involves performance-related operations that are time-expensive and memory-expensive. The 'CDCSizeTracker' class calculates the total disk usage of the CDC subsystem, which directly impacts system performance at the system level. The operations within the 'CDCSizeTracker' class, such as size recalculation and file walking, contribute significantly to execution time and memory consumption, leading to notable performance variations. Therefore, the configuration is considered performance-sensitive based on the code context and its impact on system performance."
