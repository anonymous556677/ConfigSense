    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'initial_token' configuration option is performance-sensitive. This is because the code context shows that the 'initial_token' configuration directly affects the token generation process, which is a time-expensive operation. The code checks if 'initial_tokens' are specified and uses them if available, otherwise it generates tokens based on 'allocationKeyspace' or chooses random tokens. This configuration directly impacts the token allocation algorithm and can lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
