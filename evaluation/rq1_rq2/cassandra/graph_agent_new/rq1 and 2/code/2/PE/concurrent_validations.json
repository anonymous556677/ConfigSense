{
    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'concurrent_validations' is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the 'concurrent_validations' configuration directly affects the system's performance at the system level. The code context shows that the 'concurrent_validations' configuration is used to adjust the pool size for validations, which impacts the number of concurrent validations that can be performed. This directly influences the system's performance by controlling the number of validations that can be executed concurrently, which can have a significant impact on the system's overall performance."
