    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'internode_tcp_connect_timeout_in_ms' is performance-sensitive. The code context provided shows that this configuration directly affects the TCP connection timeout for internode communication. This timeout value can have a significant impact on the performance of the system, especially in a distributed environment where internode communication is crucial. Changing this configuration can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, making it a performance-sensitive configuration."
