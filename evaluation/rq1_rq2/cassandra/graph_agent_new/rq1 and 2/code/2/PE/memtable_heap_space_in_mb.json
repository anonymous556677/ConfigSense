    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'memtable_heap_space_in_mb' is not performance-sensitive. Although it involves memory-related operations such as setting heapLimit and offHeapLimit based on the value of 'DatabaseDescriptor.getMemtableHeapSpaceInMb()' and 'DatabaseDescriptor.getMemtableOffheapSpaceInMb()', these operations are not time-expensive or memory-expensive enough to cause notable performance variations at the system level. The code snippet provided does not show any significant performance impact that would classify this configuration as performance-sensitive."
