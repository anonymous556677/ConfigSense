    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'index_summary_resize_interval_in_minutes' is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the 'index_summary_resize_interval_in_minutes' configuration directly affects the performance of the system by setting the interval at which the index summary is resized. This interval can have a significant impact on the memory usage and execution time of the system, as indicated by the code snippet where the interval is used to initialize the IndexSummaryManager. Therefore, any changes to this configuration can lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
