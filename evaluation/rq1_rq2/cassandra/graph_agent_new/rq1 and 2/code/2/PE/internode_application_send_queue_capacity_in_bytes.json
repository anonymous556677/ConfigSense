    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'internode_application_send_queue_capacity_in_bytes' is performance-sensitive. This is because the code context shows that the method 'applicationSendQueueCapacityInBytes' directly impacts the return value based on the configuration value or a default value from 'DatabaseDescriptor.getInternodeApplicationSendQueueCapacityInBytes()'. This configuration directly affects the capacity of the application send queue, which can have a significant impact on system performance at the system level, especially in scenarios where the queue capacity is crucial for efficient data transmission between nodes. Therefore, any changes in this configuration can lead to notable performance variations, making it performance-sensitive."
