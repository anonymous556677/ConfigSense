    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'auto_snapshot' is performance-sensitive. The code context related to the 'auto_snapshot' configuration involves operations that are time-expensive and memory-expensive, such as flushing memtables, truncating data, and taking snapshots. These operations directly impact system performance at the system level by consuming significant time and memory resources. Additionally, the configuration involves operations that can lead to notable performance variations, such as flushing memtables and truncating data, which further emphasize its performance sensitivity."
