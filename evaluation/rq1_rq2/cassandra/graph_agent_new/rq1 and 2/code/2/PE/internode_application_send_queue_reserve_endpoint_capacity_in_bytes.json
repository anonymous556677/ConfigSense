    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'internode_application_send_queue_reserve_endpoint_capacity_in_bytes' is performance-sensitive. This is because the code context shows that the configuration directly affects the application's send queue capacity, which can have a significant impact on system performance. The configuration involves retrieving values from DatabaseDescriptor and MessagingService, which are time-expensive operations. Additionally, setting the send queue capacity based on these values can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, making it performance-sensitive."
