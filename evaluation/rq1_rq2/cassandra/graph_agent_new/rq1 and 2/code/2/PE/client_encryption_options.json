    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'client_encryption_options' is performance-sensitive. The code context includes operations that are time-expensive and memory-expensive, such as creating JSSE SSLContext instances and netty SslContext instances, which are expensive to create and consume a lot of resources. Additionally, the code involves hot reloading of SSL certificates, which can impact system performance significantly. The configuration directly affects system performance at the system level by involving performance-related operations that lead to notable performance variations."
