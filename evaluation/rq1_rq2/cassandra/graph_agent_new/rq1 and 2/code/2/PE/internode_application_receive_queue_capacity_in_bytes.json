    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'internode_application_receive_queue_capacity_in_bytes' is performance-sensitive. This is because the 'applicationReceiveQueueCapacityInBytes' configuration directly affects the capacity of the application receive queue, which is a critical component in internode communication. The code context shows that this configuration is used to set the capacity of the application receive queue, which impacts the handling of inbound messages between nodes. The 'applicationReceiveQueueCapacityInBytes' configuration is checked for a minimum value, and any illegal values can lead to exceptions. Additionally, the 'MessagingService' class handles outbound and inbound message delivery, and the 'applicationReceiveQueueCapacityInBytes' configuration is crucial for managing message processing and delivery efficiency. Therefore, any changes to this configuration can have a notable performance impact at the system level."
