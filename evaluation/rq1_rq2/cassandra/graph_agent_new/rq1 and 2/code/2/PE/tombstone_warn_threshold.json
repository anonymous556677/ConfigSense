    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'tombstone_warn_threshold' is not performance-sensitive. The code related to this configuration does not involve any performance-related operations that are time-expensive or memory-expensive. The configuration is a simple getter method that retrieves a system-level configuration value 'TombstoneWarnThreshold'. This value is not directly involved in any performance-critical operations within the code context provided. Therefore, it does not lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
