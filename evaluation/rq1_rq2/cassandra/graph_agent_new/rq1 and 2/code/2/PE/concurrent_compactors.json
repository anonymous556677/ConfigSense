    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'concurrent_compactors' configuration option is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the 'concurrent_compactors' value directly affects the number of concurrent compactors in the system, which in turn impacts the performance of compaction operations. The code context shows that the 'getConcurrentCompactors()' method is used to retrieve the value of 'concurrent_compactors' and it is used in various parts of the CompactionManager class to manage compaction tasks. Therefore, changing the 'concurrent_compactors' value can have a notable performance impact on the system level by affecting the concurrency of compaction operations."
