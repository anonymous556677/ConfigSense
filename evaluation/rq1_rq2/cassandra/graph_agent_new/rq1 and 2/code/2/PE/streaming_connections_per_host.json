    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'streaming_connections_per_host' configuration is performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration is directly used in the code context to determine the number of streaming connections per host during operations like bootstrapping and rebuilding. The value of this configuration directly impacts the performance of streaming operations, which are time-expensive and memory-expensive, leading to notable performance variations at the system level. Therefore, any changes to this configuration can have a significant impact on system performance, making it performance-sensitive."
