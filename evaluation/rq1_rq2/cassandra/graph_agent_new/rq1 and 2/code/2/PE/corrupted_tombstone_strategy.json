    "Reason": "The configuration option 'corrupted_tombstone_strategy' is not performance-sensitive. The code context provided does not contain any performance-related operations that are time-expensive or memory-expensive. The configuration only involves retrieving a strategy value and performing some conditional checks and string operations, which are not significant enough to cause notable performance variations at the system level."
