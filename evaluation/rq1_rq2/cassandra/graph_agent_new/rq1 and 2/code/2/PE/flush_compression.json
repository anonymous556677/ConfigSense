{
    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'flush_compression' configuration option is performance-sensitive. This is because the 'flush_compression' configuration directly impacts the performance of the system at the system level. The code context provided shows that the 'flush_compression' configuration determines the CompressionParams used during a flush operation. The choice of compression algorithm can significantly affect the throughput during flushes, especially for large tables, which can queue up and potentially block writes. The code also mentions the importance of falling back to a faster compressor if needed, indicating that the choice of compression algorithm can have a notable performance impact. Therefore, based on the code context and the information provided, it can be concluded that the 'flush_compression' configuration is performance-sensitive."
