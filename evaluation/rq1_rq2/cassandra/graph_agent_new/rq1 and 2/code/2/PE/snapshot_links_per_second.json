    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'snapshot_links_per_second' is performance-sensitive. This is because the 'snapshot_links_per_second' configuration directly affects the rate at which snapshots are taken in the system, which can have a substantial impact on system performance. The code context shows that this configuration is used to create a RateLimiter, which indicates that it is related to controlling the rate of some operation. Since the rate at which snapshots are taken can be time-expensive and memory-expensive, any changes in 'snapshot_links_per_second' can lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
