    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'native_transport_idle_timeout_in_ms' is performance-sensitive. This is because the idleTimeout value directly affects the idle state handling in the channel pipeline, which can lead to significant performance variations at the system level. The code snippet shows that if the idleTimeout is greater than 0, an IdleStateHandler is added to the pipeline, which closes the client connection after a timeout. This operation is time-expensive and can impact system performance significantly, making the configuration performance-sensitive."
