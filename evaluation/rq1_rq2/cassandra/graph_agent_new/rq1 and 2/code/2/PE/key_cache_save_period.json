    "Reason": "The configuration option 'key_cache_save_period' is not performance-sensitive. The code related to this configuration involves setting the save period for the key cache, which is a routine operation that does not directly contribute to notable performance variations at the system level. The code snippet provided does not contain any performance-related operations that are time-extensive or memory-extensive, indicating that the configuration has a trivial performance impact."
