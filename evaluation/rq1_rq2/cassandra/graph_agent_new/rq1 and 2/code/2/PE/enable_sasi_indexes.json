    "Reason": "The configuration option 'enable_sasi_indexes' is not performance-sensitive. The code related to this configuration does not involve any performance-related operations that are time-extensive or memory-extensive. The configuration check for 'DatabaseDescriptor.getEnableSASIIndexes()' is a simple boolean check and does not directly impact system performance at a notable level. Additionally, the code snippet provided does not contain any operations that would cause significant performance variations at the system level."
