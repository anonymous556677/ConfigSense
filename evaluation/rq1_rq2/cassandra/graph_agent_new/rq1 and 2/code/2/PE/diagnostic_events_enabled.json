    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'diagnostic_events_enabled' is not performance-sensitive. The code context provided shows that the configuration is mainly used to check if diagnostic events are enabled before executing certain operations. While the configuration is used to control the flow of events, it does not involve any time-expensive or memory-expensive operations that would lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Therefore, the configuration is not considered performance-sensitive."
