{
    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'concurrent_counter_writes' is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the 'concurrent_counter_writes' configuration directly impacts system performance at the system level. The code context reveals that this configuration involves time-expensive and memory-expensive operations such as grabbing striped cell-level locks, reading and writing counter values, updating counter cache, and releasing locks. These operations contribute significantly to the execution time and memory consumption of the system, leading to notable performance variations. Therefore, the configuration is considered performance-sensitive."
