    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'native_transport_max_threads' is performance-sensitive. This is because the 'native_transport_max_threads' configuration directly affects the number of threads used for native transport requests, which can have a significant impact on system performance. The code context shows that this configuration is used to create an executor service with a specific number of threads for handling transport requests. The number of threads can greatly influence the concurrency and throughput of handling these requests, leading to notable performance variations at the system level."
