    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'windows_timer_interval' is performance-sensitive. This is because the code context shows that the configuration directly adjusts the system timer on Windows from the default 15ms down to the minimum of 1ms. This adjustment impacts timer intervals, thread scheduling, driver interrupts, etc., which are time-expensive operations. Changing the timer interval can have a substantial impact on system performance at the system level, making it a performance-sensitive configuration."
