    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'cached_rows_fail_threshold' is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the 'cached_rows_fail_threshold' configuration directly affects the behavior of the 'ReplicaFilteringProtection' process within the 'resolveWithReplicaFilteringProtection' method. This process involves time-expensive operations such as merging potentially out-of-date rows, querying silent replicas, and filtering rows. The 'cached_rows_fail_threshold' configuration is used to set a threshold for failing cached replica rows, which can impact the efficiency and performance of the resolution process. Therefore, any changes to this configuration can lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
