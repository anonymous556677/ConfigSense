    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'native_transport_max_frame_size_in_mb' is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the 'native_transport_max_frame_size_in_mb' configuration directly affects the maximum total length of messages that can be processed, as indicated by the 'MAX_TOTAL_LENGTH' constant in the code. This configuration setting influences the memory consumption and processing time of message envelopes, impacting system performance at the system level."
