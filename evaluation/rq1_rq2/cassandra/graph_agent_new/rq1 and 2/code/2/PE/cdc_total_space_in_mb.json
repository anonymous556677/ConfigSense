    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'cdc_total_space_in_mb' is performance-sensitive. The code context provided shows that this configuration directly affects the amount of space allocated for CDC (Change Data Capture) in megabytes. This allocation of space can have a significant impact on system performance, especially in scenarios where a large amount of CDC data needs to be stored. The multiplication by 1024 * 1024 indicates that this configuration involves memory-expensive operations, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
