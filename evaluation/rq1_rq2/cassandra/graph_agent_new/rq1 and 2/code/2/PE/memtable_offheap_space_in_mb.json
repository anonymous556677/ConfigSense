    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'memtable_offheap_space_in_mb' is performance-sensitive. This is because the value of 'offHeapLimit' is directly used in the creation of the 'SlabPool' object, which is a performance-related operation that allocates memory. The 'offHeapLimit' value can significantly impact memory consumption and allocation efficiency, leading to notable performance variations at the system level. Therefore, the configuration directly and substantially affects system performance, making it performance-sensitive."
