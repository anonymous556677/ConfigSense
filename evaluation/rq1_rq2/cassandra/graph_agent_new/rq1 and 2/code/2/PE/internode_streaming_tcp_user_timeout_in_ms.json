    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'internode_streaming_tcp_user_timeout_in_ms' is performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly affects the system performance at the system level by setting the timeout for processing incoming stream messages. The code snippet related to this configuration involves time-expensive operations such as measuring latency and comparing it to the timeout value. If the latency exceeds the timeout, it can lead to significant performance variations at the system level, potentially causing the streaming connection to be closed. Therefore, the configuration is considered performance-sensitive based on the code context and its impact on system performance."
