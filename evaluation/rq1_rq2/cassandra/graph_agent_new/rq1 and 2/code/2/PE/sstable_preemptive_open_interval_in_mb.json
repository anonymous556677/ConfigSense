    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'sstable_preemptive_open_interval_in_mb' is performance-sensitive. The code context shows that this configuration directly affects the calculation of the open interval in megabytes for SSTables. The 'calculateOpenInterval' method uses this configuration to determine the interval, which can have a significant impact on system performance. Additionally, the 'getSSTablePreemptiveOpenIntervalInMB' method directly returns this configuration value, indicating its importance in the system. Therefore, any changes to this configuration can lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
