    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The configuration 'max_hints_file_size_in_mb' is used to set the maximum size for a single hints file in megabytes. In the provided code snippet, the value of 'maxHintsFileSize' is obtained from 'DatabaseDescriptor.getMaxHintsFileSize()' and is used to determine when to break the loop while appending data to the hints file.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The triggering frequency of the 'max_hints_file_size_in_mb' configuration depends on the size of the hints file being written. Whenever the size of the hints file reaches or exceeds the value set in 'max_hints_file_size_in_mb', the loop in the code snippet will break, triggering the configuration.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the 'max_hints_file_size_in_mb' configuration option on the system is that it helps in controlling the size of individual hints files. Setting a lower value for this configuration can result in more frequent breaks in the loop while writing hints, potentially creating more hints files but keeping their size smaller. On the other hand, setting a higher value can lead to fewer breaks but larger hints files, which may impact the storage and performance of the system."
