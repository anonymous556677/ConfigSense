    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The configuration 'commitlog_sync' determines the type of CommitLog service to use, which can be either periodic, batch, or group.

For 'periodic', the CommitLog is synced every commitlog_sync_period_in_ms milliseconds. For 'batch' and 'group', the triggering frequency may vary based on the implementation of the respective CommitLog services.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the 'commitlog_sync' configuration option on the system is significant as it directly affects how often the CommitLog is synced. Choosing a different CommitLog service type can impact the system's performance, durability, and latency characteristics. For example, using 'periodic' may provide lower latency at the cost of potential data loss in case of a crash, while 'batch' or 'group' may offer better durability but potentially higher latency."
