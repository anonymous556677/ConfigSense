If the value is true or if the value is null and DatabaseDescriptor.startNativeTransport() returns true, then the native transport is started by calling the startNativeTransport method and setting RpcReady to true in StorageService. Otherwise, a message is logged indicating that the native transport is not started.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The triggering frequency of the 'start_native_transport' configuration depends on the value of 'cassandra.start_native_transport' and the return value of DatabaseDescriptor.startNativeTransport(). If either of these conditions is met, the configuration is triggered to start the native transport.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the 'start_native_transport' configuration option is significant as it determines whether the native transport server is started or not. Starting the native transport server allows clients to connect to the Cassandra cluster using the native protocol, enabling faster communication and data transfer between clients and the cluster. Not starting the native transport may limit the connectivity options for clients and affect the overall performance of the system."
