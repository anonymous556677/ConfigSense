If disabled, replicas will assume that requests were forwarded to them instantly by the coordinator, which means that under overload conditions we will waste that much extra time processing already-timed-out requests.  Warning: It is generally assumed that users have setup NTP on their clusters, and that clocks are modestly in sync, since this is a requirement for general correctness of last write wins.",
    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The configuration 'cross_node_timeout' is checked in the code to determine whether to enable operation timeout information exchange between nodes. If the DatabaseDescriptor hasCrossNodeTimeout() returns false or the createdAtNanos is greater than the currentTimeNanos, the createdAtNanos is set to the currentTimeNanos. The method then returns the sum of createdAtNanos and expirationPeriodNanos.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The triggering frequency of the 'cross_node_timeout' configuration depends on the conditions specified in the code. It is triggered whenever the getExpiresAtNanos method is called and the conditions for enabling operation timeout information exchange between nodes are met.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the 'cross_node_timeout' configuration option is significant in ensuring accurate measurement of request timeouts between nodes. If disabled, replicas may incorrectly assume that requests were forwarded instantly, leading to wasted time processing already-timed-out requests under overload conditions. It is important for users to have NTP setup on their clusters and ensure clocks are in sync for the general correctness of last write wins."
