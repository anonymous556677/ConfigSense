It is used in conjunction with other parameters to protect against inconsistent replica filtering and ensure that valid row results are produced to satisfy the query limit.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The cached_rows_fail_threshold configuration is triggered whenever the resolveWithReplicaFilteringProtection method is called, which occurs when resolving partitions with replica filtering protection. The frequency of triggering depends on the number of partitions being evaluated and the number of potentially out-of-date rows that need to be completed.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the cached_rows_fail_threshold configuration option on the system is that it influences the behavior of the replica filtering protection mechanism. Setting a lower threshold may result in more partitions being evaluated and potentially more queries being completed by directly querying silent replicas. On the other hand, setting a higher threshold may lead to fewer partitions being evaluated but may increase the risk of outdated rows not being removed during reconciliation."
