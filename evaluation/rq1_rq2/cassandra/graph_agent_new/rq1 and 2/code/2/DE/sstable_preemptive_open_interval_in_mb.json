    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The configuration 'sstable_preemptive_open_interval_in_mb' is used to calculate the open interval for preemptive opening of SSTables. The method calculateOpenInterval takes a boolean parameter shouldOpenEarly and calculates the interval based on the value of 'sstable_preemptive_open_interval_in_mb' from DatabaseDescriptor. If certain conditions are met, the interval is set to Long.MAX_VALUE.",

    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the configuration option is that it allows replacement SSTables to be opened before they are completely written, which helps in transferring reads smoothly between SSTables, reducing page cache churn, and keeping hot rows hot. This can improve the performance of the system by optimizing the way SSTables are handled during compaction."
