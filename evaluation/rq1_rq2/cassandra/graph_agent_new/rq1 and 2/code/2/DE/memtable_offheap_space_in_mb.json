Cassandra will stop accepting writes when the limit is exceeded until a flush completes, and will trigger a flush based on memtable_cleanup_threshold If omitted, Cassandra will set both to 1/4 the size of the heap. memtable_heap_space_in_mb: 2048",
    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The 'memtable_offheap_space_in_mb' configuration is used to set the total permitted off-heap memory to use for memtables. In the code snippet provided, the offHeapLimit is calculated by shifting the value of 'memtable_offheap_space_in_mb' left by 20 bits, which is then used in the creation of the MemtablePool.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The triggering frequency of the 'memtable_offheap_space_in_mb' configuration in the system depends on the memtable_cleanup_threshold value. When the total off-heap memory used for memtables exceeds the offHeapLimit set by 'memtable_offheap_space_in_mb', Cassandra will stop accepting writes until a flush completes. The frequency of triggering a flush is based on the memtable_cleanup_threshold.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the 'memtable_offheap_space_in_mb' configuration option on the system is significant. Setting a higher value for 'memtable_offheap_space_in_mb' allows Cassandra to use more off-heap memory for memtables, potentially improving performance by reducing the frequency of flushes. However, allocating too much off-heap memory for memtables can lead to increased memory usage and potential performance issues."
