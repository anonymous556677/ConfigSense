    "config_description": "GC Pauses greater than gc_warn_threshold_in_ms will be logged at WARN level Adjust the threshold based on your application throughput requirement. Setting to 0 will deactivate the feature.",
    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The gc_warn_threshold_in_ms configuration is used to set a threshold for logging GC pauses at the WARN level. If the GC pause exceeds the specified threshold, a warning message will be logged. This allows developers to adjust the threshold based on the application's throughput requirement, and setting it to 0 will deactivate the feature.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The triggering frequency of the gc_warn_threshold_in_ms configuration depends on the frequency and duration of GC pauses in the system. If the GC pauses exceed the threshold set by gc_warn_threshold_in_ms, the configuration will be triggered to log a warning message.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the gc_warn_threshold_in_ms configuration option on the system is that it can help developers monitor and manage GC pauses. By setting an appropriate threshold, developers can identify and address performance issues related to GC pauses, ultimately improving the overall system performance."
