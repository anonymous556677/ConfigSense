When the total memory used by memtables exceeds the limit specified in 'memtable_heap_space_in_mb', Cassandra will stop accepting writes until a flush completes. The frequency of triggering a flush is based on the memtable_cleanup_threshold value.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the 'memtable_heap_space_in_mb' configuration option on the system is significant. If the configured memory limit is too low, it can lead to frequent flushes and potentially impact the performance of the system. On the other hand, setting a high memory limit can result in more memory usage but may improve the overall performance by reducing the frequency of flushes."
