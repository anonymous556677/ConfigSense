    "config_description": "internode_compression controls whether traffic between nodes is compressed. Can be:  all all traffic is compressed  dc traffic between different datacenters is compressed  none nothing is compressed.",
    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The configuration 'internode_compression' is used in the shouldCompressConnection method to determine whether the connection between nodes should be compressed. It checks if the internodeCompression setting in DatabaseDescriptor is set to 'all' or 'dc' and if the connection is not within the local data center.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The triggering frequency of the 'internode_compression' configuration depends on the number of connections between nodes and the setting of the internodeCompression in DatabaseDescriptor. If there are frequent inter-node communications, the configuration will be triggered more often.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the 'internode_compression' configuration on the system can be significant in terms of network bandwidth and CPU usage. If set to 'all', it will compress all traffic between nodes, which can reduce network bandwidth but increase CPU usage. If set to 'dc', it will only compress traffic between different data centers, which can still reduce network bandwidth but to a lesser extent compared to 'all'. If set to 'none', no compression will be applied, which may result in higher network bandwidth usage."
