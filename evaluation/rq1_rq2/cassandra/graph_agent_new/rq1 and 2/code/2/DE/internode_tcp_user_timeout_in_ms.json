The amount of time to wait for internode tcp connections to establish. internode_tcp_connect_timeout_in_ms: 2000  The amount of time unacknowledged data is allowed on a connection before we throw out the connection Note this is only supported on Linux + epoll, and it appears to behave oddly above a setting of 30000 (it takes much longer than 30s) as of Linux 4.12. If you want something that high set this to 0 which picks up the OS default and configure the net.ipv4.tcp_retries2 sysctl to be ~8.",
    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The configuration 'internode_tcp_user_timeout_in_ms' is used in the code to set the amount of time to wait for internode tcp connections to establish. The method tcpUserTimeoutInMS() checks if the configuration value is set, and if not, it returns the value based on the connection category (MESSAGING or STREAMING) by calling DatabaseDescriptor.getInternodeTcpUserTimeoutInMS() or DatabaseDescriptor.getInternodeStreamingTcpUserTimeoutInMS().",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The triggering frequency of the 'internode_tcp_user_timeout_in_ms' configuration depends on the usage of internode tcp connections in the system. It is triggered whenever a new connection is established or when the existing connection timeout is reached.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the 'internode_tcp_user_timeout_in_ms' configuration option is significant for the system's stability and performance. Setting this value too low may lead to premature connection timeouts and potential data loss, while setting it too high may result in longer connection establishment times and potential resource wastage. It is crucial to configure this value appropriately based on the system's requirements and network conditions."
