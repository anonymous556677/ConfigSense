    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'internode_application_send_queue_capacity_in_bytes' is performance-sensitive. The code context provided shows that this configuration directly affects the application's send queue capacity, which can have a significant impact on system performance at the system level. Additionally, the method involves a conditional check and a method call to retrieve the value, which can be time-expensive operations. Therefore, any changes to this configuration can lead to notable performance variations in the system."
