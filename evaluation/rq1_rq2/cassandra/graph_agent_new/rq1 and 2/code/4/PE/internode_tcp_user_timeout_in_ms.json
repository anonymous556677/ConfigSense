    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'internode_tcp_user_timeout_in_ms' is performance-sensitive. This is because the 'tcpUserTimeoutInMS' method directly impacts system performance by returning different timeout values based on the connection category, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The code context shows that this configuration involves performance-related operations that are time-expensive, as it retrieves timeout values from the DatabaseDescriptor, which can affect the overall system performance."
