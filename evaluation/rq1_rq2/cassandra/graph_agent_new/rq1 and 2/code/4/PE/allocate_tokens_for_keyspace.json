{
    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'allocate_tokens_for_keyspace' is performance-sensitive. This is because the code context provided involves operations that directly impact system performance, such as token allocation algorithms and token generation. These operations are time-expensive and memory-expensive, leading to notable performance variations at the system level. Additionally, the configuration directly affects the distribution of tokens in the system, which can have a significant impact on performance. Therefore, based on the code context and the nature of the operations involved, the configuration is classified as performance-sensitive."
