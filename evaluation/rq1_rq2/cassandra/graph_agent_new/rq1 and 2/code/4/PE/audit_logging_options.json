    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'audit_logging_options' configuration is performance-sensitive. The code context shows that the configuration directly impacts the system performance by enabling audit logging and creating audit loggers based on the provided options. These operations involve time-expensive and memory-expensive tasks such as creating log files, setting log paths, and handling log size. Enabling audit logging can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, making this configuration performance-sensitive."
