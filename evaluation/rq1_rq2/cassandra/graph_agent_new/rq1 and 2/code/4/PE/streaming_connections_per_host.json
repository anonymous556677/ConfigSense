    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'streaming_connections_per_host' is performance-sensitive. This is because the 'DatabaseDescriptor.getStreamingConnectionsPerHost()' method is called within the code context, which directly affects the number of streaming connections per host. This configuration can have a notable performance impact at the system level, as it determines the number of concurrent streaming connections established during operations like bootstrap and rebuild. The number of streaming connections per host can significantly impact the overall performance of data streaming and replication processes, making this configuration performance-sensitive."
