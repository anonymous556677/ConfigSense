    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'cdc_free_space_check_interval_ms' is performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration involves performance-related operations that are time-extensive and memory-expensive within its related code. The 'CDCSizeTracker' class, which is related to the configuration, performs size calculations and disk checks that directly impact system performance at the system level. These operations contribute significantly to execution time and memory consumption, leading to notable performance variations. Therefore, the configuration is considered performance-sensitive based on the code context and the impact on system performance."
