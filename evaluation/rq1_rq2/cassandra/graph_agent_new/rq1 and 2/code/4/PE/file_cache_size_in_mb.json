    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'file_cache_size_in_mb' is performance-sensitive. The code context shows that the 'file_cache_size_in_mb' configuration directly affects the calculation of the 'cacheSize' variable, which is used to determine the maximum weight for the cache. This calculation involves a significant operation that can impact system performance by allocating memory based on the configured size. Additionally, the 'file_cache_size_in_mb' configuration is used to set the 'FILE_MEMORY_USAGE_THRESHOLD' in the 'BufferPools' class, which further emphasizes its impact on system performance at the memory level."
