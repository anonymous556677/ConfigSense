    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'write_request_timeout_in_ms' is performance-sensitive. The configuration is directly related to the 'write_request_timeout' setting, which affects the timeout for write operations at the system level. The code context shows that the 'write_request_timeout_in_ms' configuration is used in various methods like 'getTimeout', 'currentTimeoutNanos', 'getWriteRpcTimeout', 'excise', 'await', etc., which are critical for handling write operations. These methods are time-expensive and directly impact the performance of the system by controlling the timeout for write operations. Therefore, the configuration is performance-sensitive as it directly affects system performance by controlling write operation timeouts."
