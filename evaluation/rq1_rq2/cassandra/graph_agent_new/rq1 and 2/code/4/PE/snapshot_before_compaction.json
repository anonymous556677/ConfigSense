    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'snapshot_before_compaction' is performance-sensitive. This is because the code snippet related to this configuration involves time-expensive and memory-expensive operations such as snapshot creation, compaction of SSTables, and logging of statistics. These operations directly impact system performance at the system level by consuming significant time and memory resources during the compaction process. Additionally, the configuration setting 'DatabaseDescriptor.isSnapshotBeforeCompaction()' triggers the creation of snapshots before compaction, which adds an extra overhead to the compaction process, leading to notable performance variations."
