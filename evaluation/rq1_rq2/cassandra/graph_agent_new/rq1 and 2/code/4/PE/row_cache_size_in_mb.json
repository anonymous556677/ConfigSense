    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'row_cache_size_in_mb' is performance-sensitive. This is because the 'row_cache_size_in_mb' configuration directly affects the capacity of the row cache in megabytes, which in turn impacts the memory consumption of the system. The code snippets provided show that the 'row_cache_size_in_mb' configuration is used to set the capacity of the row cache, which can significantly affect the performance of the system by allocating a large amount of memory. Therefore, any changes to this configuration can lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
