    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The 'commit_failure_policy' configuration option does not appear to be performance-sensitive based on the provided code context. The code mainly handles error handling and logging based on the commit failure policy set in the configuration. While the configuration may impact error handling behavior, it does not involve any performance-related operations that are time-expensive or memory-expensive. The code does not show any direct and substantial impact on system performance at the system level. Therefore, the configuration is classified as not performance-sensitive."
