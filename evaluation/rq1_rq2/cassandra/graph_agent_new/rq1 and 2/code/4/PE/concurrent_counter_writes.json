    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'concurrent_counter_writes' is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the 'concurrent_counter_writes' configuration involves time-expensive operations such as grabbing striped cell-level locks, getting current values from the counter cache, reading current values from the CF, writing updated counter values, updating the counter cache, and releasing locks. These operations directly and substantially affect system performance at the system level, leading to notable performance variations. Additionally, the configuration-related code contains code snippets that contribute significantly to execution time and memory consumption, making it performance-sensitive."
