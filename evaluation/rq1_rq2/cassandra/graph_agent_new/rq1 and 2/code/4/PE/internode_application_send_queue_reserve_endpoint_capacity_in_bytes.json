    "Reason": "The configuration option 'internode_application_send_queue_reserve_endpoint_capacity_in_bytes' is not performance-sensitive. The code snippet provided does not contain any performance-related operations that are time-expensive or memory-expensive. The configuration simply assigns values to variables based on certain conditions and does not directly and substantially affect system performance at the system level."
