    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'internode_tcp_connect_timeout_in_ms' is performance-sensitive. The code context shows that this configuration directly impacts the TCP connection timeout duration between internodes in a distributed system. This timeout duration can have a significant impact on the overall system performance, especially in scenarios where network latency or node unavailability can lead to delays in communication. Therefore, any changes to this configuration can directly affect the system's performance at the system level, making it a performance-sensitive configuration."
