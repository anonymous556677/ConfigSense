    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'num_tokens' is performance-sensitive. The code context shows that the 'getNumTokens()' method is being called multiple times in the provided code snippet. The 'getNumTokens()' method is directly related to the 'num_tokens' configuration option. This configuration option is used in critical sections of the code where it determines the behavior of the system, such as throwing exceptions based on the value of 'num_tokens'. Any changes to this configuration can lead to significant performance variations at the system level, making it performance-sensitive."
