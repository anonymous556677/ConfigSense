    "classification_result": "Performance-insensitive with 100% confidence",
    "Reason": "The partitioner configuration option is related to the distribution of data across nodes in the cluster based on partition key. Changing the partitioner requires reloading all data and is recommended to keep it consistent when adding nodes or upgrading. The default partitioner is already optimized for performance, and changing it for new clusters is not necessary, indicating that it is performance-insensitive."
