    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'range_request_timeout_in_ms' is performance-sensitive. The code context provided shows that the configuration directly affects the system's performance by setting timeouts for various RPC operations. The 'getRangeRpcTimeout' method is called multiple times in the code, indicating that it is a critical configuration for controlling the timeout of range requests. Setting a timeout for range requests can significantly impact the system's performance, as it determines how long the system waits for a response before timing out. Therefore, any changes to this configuration can lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
