    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'enable_user_defined_functions' is performance-sensitive. This is because the code context shows that the configuration directly affects the behavior of the program by enabling or disabling user-defined functions. Enabling user-defined functions can introduce time-expensive and memory-expensive operations, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Therefore, this configuration has a direct and substantial impact on system performance."
