    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'enable_drop_compact_storage' is performance-sensitive. The code context shows that this configuration directly affects system performance by checking if 'DROP COMPACT STORAGE' is enabled in the cassandra.yaml file before executing certain operations. This check involves time-expensive and memory-expensive operations that lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Additionally, the configuration is crucial for determining the storage format of tables, which can significantly impact performance."
