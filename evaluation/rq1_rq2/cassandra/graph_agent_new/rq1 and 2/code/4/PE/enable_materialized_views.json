    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'enable_materialized_views' is not performance-sensitive. The code related to this configuration does not involve any performance-intensive operations that would lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The configuration mainly deals with validation and setup of materialized views, which do not have a significant impact on system performance."
