    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'internode_streaming_tcp_user_timeout_in_ms' is performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly affects the system performance at the system level by setting a timeout for processing incoming stream messages. The code snippet related to this configuration includes time-expensive operations such as measuring latency and comparing it with the timeout value. If the latency exceeds the timeout, it can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, potentially causing the streaming connection to be closed. Therefore, this configuration is considered performance-sensitive."
