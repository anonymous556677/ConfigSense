    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'initial_token' configuration option is performance-sensitive. This is because the 'initial_tokens' are directly used in the code to generate suitable tokens for bootstrap operations. The code snippet checks for the presence of 'initial_tokens' and if they are specified, it uses those tokens directly, which can have a significant impact on the performance of the system. Additionally, the code contains operations that contribute to execution time and memory consumption, such as token allocation and token generation, which are time-expensive and memory-expensive. Therefore, the 'initial_token' configuration option is considered performance-sensitive as it directly and substantially affects system performance at the system level."
