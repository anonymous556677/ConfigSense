    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'compaction_large_partition_warning_threshold_mb' is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the 'maybeLogLargePartitionWarning' method is triggered when the 'rowSize' exceeds the 'CompactionLargePartitionWarningThreshold' value obtained from 'DatabaseDescriptor'. This operation involves checking the size of a partition and logging a warning message if it is large. This operation is time-expensive as it involves string manipulation and logging, which can impact system performance. Therefore, the configuration directly and substantially affects system performance at the system level, making it performance-sensitive."
