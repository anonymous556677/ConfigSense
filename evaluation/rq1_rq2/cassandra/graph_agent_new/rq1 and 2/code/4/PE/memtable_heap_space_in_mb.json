    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'memtable_heap_space_in_mb' configuration option is performance-sensitive. This is because the value of 'heapLimit' and 'offHeapLimit' directly impact the memory allocation for memtable storage, which can significantly affect the performance of the system. The configuration-related code snippet involves memory-expensive operations like shifting bits to calculate memory limits and allocating memory based on the configuration values. These memory allocations can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, making this configuration performance-sensitive."
