    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'internode_authenticator' is performance-sensitive. This is because the 'internode_authenticator' configuration directly affects the system's network authentication process, which is crucial for the overall performance of the system. The code snippet related to 'internode_authenticator' involves setting the internode authenticator using 'DatabaseDescriptor.setInternodeAuthenticator', which is a time-expensive operation. Additionally, the validation of the internode authenticator configuration at the end of the 'applyAuth' method further emphasizes its importance in the system's performance. Therefore, any changes or misconfigurations in the 'internode_authenticator' configuration can lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
