    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'concurrent_materialized_view_builders' is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the configuration directly affects the number of concurrent view builders, which can impact the performance of compaction operations at the system level. The code context shows that the configuration is used to set the number of concurrent view builders, which can have a notable performance impact on compaction tasks, especially when handling a large number of sstables. Therefore, changes to this configuration can lead to significant performance variations at the system level."
