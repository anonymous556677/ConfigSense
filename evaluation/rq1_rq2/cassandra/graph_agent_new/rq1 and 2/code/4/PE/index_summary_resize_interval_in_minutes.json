    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'index_summary_resize_interval_in_minutes' is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the 'index_summary_resize_interval_in_minutes' configuration directly affects the performance of the system at the system level. The code context provided shows that this configuration is used to set the resize interval for the index summary manager, which can impact the memory consumption and execution time of the system. Changing this interval can lead to notable performance variations, making it a performance-sensitive configuration."
