    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'sstable_preemptive_open_interval_in_mb' is performance-sensitive. The code context provided shows that this configuration directly affects the calculation of the open interval in megabytes for SSTable preemptive opening. The 'calculateOpenInterval' method uses this configuration to determine the interval, which can have a significant impact on system performance. Additionally, the 'getSSTablePreemptiveOpenIntervalInMB' method directly returns this configuration value, indicating its importance in the system. Therefore, the configuration involves performance-related operations that are time-expensive and can lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
