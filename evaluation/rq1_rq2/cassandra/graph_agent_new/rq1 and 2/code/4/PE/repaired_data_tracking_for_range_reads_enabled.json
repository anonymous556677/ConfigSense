    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'repaired_data_tracking_for_range_reads_enabled' is performance-sensitive. This is because the code snippet related to this configuration involves checking if 'DatabaseDescriptor.getRepairedDataTrackingForRangeReadsEnabled()' is enabled and then performing operations based on this condition. The 'getRepairedDataTrackingEnabledForRangeReads()' method directly returns the value of 'DatabaseDescriptor.getRepairedDataTrackingForRangeReadsEnabled()', which indicates that this configuration directly affects the behavior of the system. Additionally, the code snippet involves querying sub-ranges and requesting repaired data tracking info from full replicas, which are time-expensive operations. These operations can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, making this configuration performance-sensitive."
