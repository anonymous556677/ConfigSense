    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'inter_dc_stream_throughput_outbound_megabits_per_sec' is classified as performance-sensitive. This is because the code context provided shows that this configuration directly affects the inter-DC stream throughput in terms of outbound megabits per second. The 'setInterDCStreamThroughputMbPerSec' method updates the value of this configuration, which in turn triggers the 'updateInterDCThroughput' method to adjust the stream rate limiter. Additionally, the 'calculateInterDCRateInBytes' method calculates the inter-DC rate in bytes based on this configuration. These operations involving the configuration have a direct impact on system performance at the system level, making it performance-sensitive."
