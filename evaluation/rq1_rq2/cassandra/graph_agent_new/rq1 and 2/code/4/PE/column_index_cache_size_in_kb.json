    "Reason": "The configuration option 'column_index_cache_size_in_kb' is not performance-sensitive. The code snippet provided simply returns the value of the column index cache size in kilobytes from the DatabaseDescriptor. This configuration does not involve any performance-related operations that are time-extensive or memory-extensive within its related code. Therefore, it does not lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
