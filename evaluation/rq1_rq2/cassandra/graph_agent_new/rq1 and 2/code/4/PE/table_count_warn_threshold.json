    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'table_count_warn_threshold' is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the 'tableCount' variable in the code snippet directly depends on the 'tableCountWarnThreshold()' method from the 'DatabaseDescriptor' class. If the 'tableCount' exceeds the threshold set by 'tableCountWarnThreshold()', a warning message is logged, indicating a potential performance impact due to a large number of tables in the cluster. This configuration directly affects system performance by monitoring the number of tables and triggering a warning based on the threshold, making it performance-sensitive."
