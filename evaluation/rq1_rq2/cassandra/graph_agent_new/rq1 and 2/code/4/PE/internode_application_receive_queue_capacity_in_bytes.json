    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'internode_application_receive_queue_capacity_in_bytes' is performance-sensitive. This is because the 'applicationReceiveQueueCapacityInBytes' configuration directly affects the capacity of the application receive queue, which is a critical component in internode communication. The code context shows that this configuration value is checked against a minimum value and is used in various parts of the code to set the capacity of the application receive queue. The capacity of the application receive queue can have a significant impact on the performance of internode communication at the system level, making this configuration performance-sensitive."
