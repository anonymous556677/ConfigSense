    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'key_cache_size_in_mb' is not performance-sensitive. The code snippet related to this configuration involves initializing a key cache with a specified capacity in MBs. While the configuration affects the memory consumption of the key cache, it does not directly lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The code snippet does not contain any performance-intensive operations that would significantly impact system performance. Therefore, the configuration is not classified as performance-sensitive."
