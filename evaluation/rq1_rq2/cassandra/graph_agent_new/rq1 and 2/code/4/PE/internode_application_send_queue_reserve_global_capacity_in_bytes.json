    "Reason": "The configuration option 'internode_application_send_queue_reserve_global_capacity_in_bytes' is not performance-sensitive. The provided code context does not involve any performance-related operations that are time-extensive or memory-extensive. The code snippet only schedules a connection monitoring task, which is not directly related to system performance at the system level. Therefore, this configuration does not lead to notable performance variations."
