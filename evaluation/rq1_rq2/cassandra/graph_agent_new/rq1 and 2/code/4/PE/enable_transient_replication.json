    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'enable_transient_replication' is not performance-sensitive. The code related to this configuration does not contain any performance-related operations that significantly impact system performance at the system level. The code mainly focuses on validation and checking conditions related to transient replication, which does not involve time-expensive or memory-expensive operations that would lead to notable performance variations."
