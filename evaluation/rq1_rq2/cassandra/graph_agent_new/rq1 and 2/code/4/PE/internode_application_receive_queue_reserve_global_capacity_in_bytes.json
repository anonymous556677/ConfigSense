    "Reason": "The configuration option 'internode_application_receive_queue_reserve_global_capacity_in_bytes' is not performance-sensitive. The provided code context does not show any performance-related operations that are time-expensive or memory-expensive. The code snippet is related to setting up a messaging service and scheduling unused connection monitoring, which does not directly and substantially affect system performance at the system level. Therefore, this configuration is not considered performance-sensitive."
