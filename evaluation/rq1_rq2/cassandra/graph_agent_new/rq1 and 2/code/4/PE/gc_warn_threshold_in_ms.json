    "Reason": "The configuration option 'gc_warn_threshold_in_ms' is not performance-sensitive. The code context provided does not show any performance-related operations that are time-extensive or memory-extensive within the configuration-related code. The code snippet mainly deals with setting up the Garbage Collector MXBean and registering the MBeanServer, which are not directly impacting system performance at a notable level."
