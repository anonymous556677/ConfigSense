    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'concurrent_compactors' is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the 'concurrent_compactors' configuration directly affects the system's performance at the system level by controlling the number of concurrent compactors. The code context shows that this configuration is used to set the number of concurrent compactors, which are responsible for managing ongoing compactions in the system. Adjusting this configuration can have a notable impact on system performance by influencing the efficiency of compaction tasks, which are time-expensive and memory-expensive operations. Therefore, changes to this configuration can lead to significant performance variations at the system level."
