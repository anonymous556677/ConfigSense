    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'cross_node_timeout' does not appear to be performance-sensitive based on the provided code context. The code snippet does not contain any performance-related operations that are time-expensive or memory-expensive. Additionally, the 'cross_node_timeout' configuration does not directly and substantially affect system performance at the system level. Therefore, it is classified as not performance-sensitive."
