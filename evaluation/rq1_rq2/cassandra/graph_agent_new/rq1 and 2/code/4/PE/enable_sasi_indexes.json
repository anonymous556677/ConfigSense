    "Reason": "The configuration option 'enable_sasi_indexes' is not performance-sensitive. The code context provided does not contain any performance-related operations that are time-expensive or memory-expensive. The configuration check for SASI indexes being disabled is a validation check and does not directly impact system performance at the system level. Therefore, based on the code context, the configuration is not performance-sensitive."
