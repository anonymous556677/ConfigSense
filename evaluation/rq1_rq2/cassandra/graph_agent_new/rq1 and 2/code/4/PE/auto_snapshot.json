    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'auto_snapshot' configuration option is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the 'auto_snapshot' configuration directly impacts system performance by triggering the creation of snapshots, which involves time-expensive and memory-expensive operations such as flushing memtables, truncating data, and snapshotting. These operations can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, making the configuration performance-sensitive."
