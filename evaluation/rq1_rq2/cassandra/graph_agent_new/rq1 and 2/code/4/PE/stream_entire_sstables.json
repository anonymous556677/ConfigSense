    "Reason": "The configuration option 'stream_entire_sstables' does not appear to be performance-sensitive based on the provided code context. The code snippet provided does not contain any performance-intensive operations that would lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The configuration check for 'streamEntireSSTables()' and 'hasLegacyCounterShards' are straightforward boolean checks and do not involve any time-expensive or memory-expensive operations."
