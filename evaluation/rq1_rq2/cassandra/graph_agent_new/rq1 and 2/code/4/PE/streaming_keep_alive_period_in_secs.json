    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'streaming_keep_alive_period_in_secs' is performance-sensitive. This is because the value of this configuration directly affects the keep-alive task scheduling in the code context provided. The 'streaming_keep_alive_period_in_secs' is used to determine the period at which the keep-alive task is scheduled, which can have a significant impact on the system's performance. If this value is set too low, it may result in frequent keep-alive tasks being scheduled, leading to increased resource consumption. On the other hand, if it is set too high, it may result in longer intervals between keep-alive tasks, potentially impacting the system's responsiveness. Therefore, any changes to this configuration can directly and substantially affect the system's performance at the system level."
