    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'truncate_request_timeout_in_ms' is performance-sensitive. The code context provided shows that the 'truncate' operation involves time-expensive operations related to timeouts and waiting for responses. These operations directly impact system performance by potentially causing delays and timeouts, leading to notable performance variations at the system level. Therefore, the configuration is considered performance-sensitive."
