    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'ideal_consistency_level' is performance-sensitive. This is because the 'ideal_consistency_level' directly affects the performance of the system by tracking the ideal consistency level for write operations. The code related to this configuration involves operations that are time-expensive, such as constructing delegate response handlers and setting ideal consistency levels. These operations can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, making the configuration performance-sensitive."
