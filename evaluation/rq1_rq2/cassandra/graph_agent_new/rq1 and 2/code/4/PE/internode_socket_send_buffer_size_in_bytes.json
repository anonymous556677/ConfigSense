    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'internode_socket_send_buffer_size_in_bytes' is performance-sensitive. This is because the 'socketSendBufferSizeInBytes' method directly impacts the size of the socket send buffer, which can have a significant impact on network performance at the system level. The code snippet provided shows that the method returns the value of 'socketSendBufferSizeInBytes' if it is not null, otherwise it retrieves the value from 'DatabaseDescriptor.getInternodeSocketSendBufferSizeInBytes()', indicating that this configuration directly affects network communication performance. Therefore, any changes in the send buffer size can lead to notable performance variations in terms of network latency and throughput."
