    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'memtable_cleanup_threshold' configuration option is performance-sensitive. This is because the 'cleaningThreshold' value directly impacts the behavior of the MemtablePool creation process, affecting the allocation of memory for memtables. The 'cleaningThreshold' value is used in determining when to trigger the cleaning process for memtables, which can have a significant impact on system performance by affecting memory usage and cleanup operations. Therefore, any changes in the 'memtable_cleanup_threshold' configuration can lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
