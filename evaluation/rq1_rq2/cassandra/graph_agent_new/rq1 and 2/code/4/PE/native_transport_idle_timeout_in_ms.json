    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'native_transport_idle_timeout_in_ms' is performance-sensitive. This is because the 'idleTimeout' value obtained from the configuration directly affects the idle timeout of the native transport connection. The idle timeout is crucial for managing resources efficiently and avoiding unnecessary resource consumption. Setting a low idle timeout can help in releasing resources quickly, while a high idle timeout can lead to resource wastage. Therefore, the 'native_transport_idle_timeout_in_ms' configuration directly impacts the performance of the system by influencing resource utilization and connection management at the system level."
