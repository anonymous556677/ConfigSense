    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'gc_log_threshold_in_ms' is performance-sensitive. This is because the code context provided shows that the GCInspector class is responsible for managing Garbage Collection operations in the system. Garbage Collection operations are known to be time-expensive and memory-expensive processes that directly impact system performance. The configuration related to GC log threshold in milliseconds ('gc_log_threshold_in_ms') can significantly affect how Garbage Collection is managed, leading to notable performance variations at the system level. Therefore, the configuration is considered performance-sensitive."
