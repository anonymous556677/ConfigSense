    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'snapshot_links_per_second' is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the 'getSnapshotLinksPerSecond' method directly affects the rate at which the RateLimiter is created, which can have a substantial impact on system performance. The code context shows that this configuration involves a performance-related operation that is time-expensive (retrieving the snapshot links per second value from the database) and can lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
