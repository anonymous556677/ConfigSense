    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'stream_throughput_outbound_megabits_per_sec' is performance-sensitive. This is because the 'setStreamThroughputMbPerSec' method directly updates the stream throughput outbound megabits per second value in the DatabaseDescriptor, which in turn affects the rate limiter for stream management. The 'calculateRateInBytes' method also calculates the rate in bytes based on this configuration value. Any changes to this configuration can have a direct impact on the system's performance at the system level by enabling or disabling throttling based on the throughput value. Therefore, this configuration involves performance-related operations that are time-extensive and memory-extensive, leading to notable performance variations at the system level."
