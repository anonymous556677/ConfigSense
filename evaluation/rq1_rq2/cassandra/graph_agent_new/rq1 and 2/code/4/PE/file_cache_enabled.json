    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'file_cache_enabled' configuration option is performance-sensitive. This is because the 'enabled' variable in the code directly depends on the 'file_cache_enabled' configuration and the 'cacheSize' variable. The 'enabled' variable is used to determine whether to instantiate the ChunkCache class, which in turn affects the caching behavior of the system. If 'file_cache_enabled' is set to false, the cache will not be utilized, leading to potential performance degradation due to increased disk I/O operations. Therefore, the configuration has a direct and substantial impact on system performance at the system level."
