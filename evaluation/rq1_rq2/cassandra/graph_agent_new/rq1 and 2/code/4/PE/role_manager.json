    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The 'role_manager' configuration does not involve any performance-sensitive operations that would lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The code context primarily focuses on authentication, authorization, and role management, which are not time-expensive or memory-expensive operations. Additionally, the configuration-related code does not directly and substantially affect system performance in a way that would classify it as performance-sensitive."
