    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'server_encryption_options' is performance-sensitive. The code context reveals that the configuration involves operations related to SSL encryption, which are time-expensive and memory-expensive. The configuration directly impacts system performance at the system level by creating SSL contexts, validating SSL certificates, and creating Netty SslContext instances. These operations contribute significantly to execution time and memory consumption, leading to notable performance variations at the system level."
