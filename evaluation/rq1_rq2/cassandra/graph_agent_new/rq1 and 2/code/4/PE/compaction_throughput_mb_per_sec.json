    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'compaction_throughput_mb_per_sec' is performance-sensitive. The code context provided shows that this configuration directly affects the compaction rate limiter, which can have a significant impact on system performance. By setting the compaction throughput in megabytes per second, it influences the rate at which compaction operations are performed, which can be time-expensive and memory-expensive. Therefore, changes in this configuration can lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
