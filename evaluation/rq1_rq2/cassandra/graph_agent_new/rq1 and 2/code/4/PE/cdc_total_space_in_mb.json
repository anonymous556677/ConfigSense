    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'cdc_total_space_in_mb' is considered performance-sensitive. The code snippet provided shows that the configuration directly affects the amount of space allocated for CDC (Change Data Capture) in the system, which can have a substantial impact on system performance. By multiplying the value of 'DatabaseDescriptor.getCDCSpaceInMB()' by 1024 * 1024, the configuration determines the total space in bytes allocated for CDC, which can be memory-expensive. Any changes in this configuration can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, making it performance-sensitive."
