    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'cached_rows_fail_threshold' is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the 'cached_rows_fail_threshold' configuration directly impacts the behavior of the ReplicaFilteringProtection, which is a critical component in ensuring data consistency and query performance. The configuration value is used to set the threshold for failing cached replica rows, which can significantly affect the efficiency of resolving queries with replica filtering protection. Any misconfiguration of this threshold can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, making it a performance-sensitive configuration."
