    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'dynamic_snitch_reset_interval_in_ms' is performance-sensitive. This is because the 'dynamicResetInterval' configuration parameter directly affects the scheduling of tasks that involve time-expensive operations (e.g., 'reset' task) at the system level. The code snippet shows that the 'reset' task is scheduled with a fixed delay based on the 'dynamicResetInterval' value, which can significantly impact system performance. Additionally, changes to the 'dynamicResetInterval' configuration parameter trigger the cancellation and rescheduling of the 'reset' task, indicating its importance in system performance optimization. Therefore, the configuration is considered performance-sensitive due to its direct and substantial impact on system performance through time-expensive operations."
