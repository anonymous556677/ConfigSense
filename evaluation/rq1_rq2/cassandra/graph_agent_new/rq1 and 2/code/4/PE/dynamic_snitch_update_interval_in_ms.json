    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'dynamic_snitch_update_interval_in_ms' is performance-sensitive. This is because the 'dynamicUpdateInterval' and 'dynamicResetInterval' values directly impact the scheduling of tasks that involve time-expensive operations (e.g., updating scores and resetting bad hosts). These values are set based on the 'DatabaseDescriptor' configuration, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Additionally, the 'applyConfigChanges' method updates the intervals based on the 'DatabaseDescriptor' values, further emphasizing the performance impact of this configuration."
