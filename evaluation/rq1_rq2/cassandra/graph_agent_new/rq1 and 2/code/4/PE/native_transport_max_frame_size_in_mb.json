    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'native_transport_max_frame_size_in_mb' is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the 'native_transport_max_frame_size_in_mb' configuration directly affects the maximum total length of messages that can be processed, as seen in the 'Decoder' class. This configuration impacts the memory consumption and execution time of handling incoming messages, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
