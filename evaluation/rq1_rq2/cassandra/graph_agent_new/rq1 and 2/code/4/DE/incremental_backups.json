    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The configuration 'incremental_backups' works by checking if the incremental backups are enabled in the DatabaseDescriptor. If enabled, it creates a hard link to each SSTable flushed or streamed locally in a backups/ subdirectory of the keyspace data.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The configuration is triggered whenever the maybeIncrementallyBackup method is called with a list of SSTableReader objects. The frequency of triggering depends on the frequency of calling this method in the system.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the 'incremental_backups' configuration option is that it creates hard links to SSTables, which can potentially increase the storage space required for maintaining these links. However, it provides a way to backup SSTables efficiently without duplicating the data."
