    "config_description": "When compacting, the replacement sstable(s) can be opened before they are completely written, and used in place of the prior sstables for any range that has been written. This helps to smoothly transfer reads between the sstables, reducing page cache churn and keeping hot rows hot",
    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The configuration 'sstable_preemptive_open_interval_in_mb' is used to calculate the interval at which replacement sstables can be opened before they are completely written during compaction. This helps in smoothly transferring reads between sstables and reducing page cache churn.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The triggering frequency of the configuration depends on the frequency of compaction operations in the system. If there are frequent compactions, this configuration will be triggered more often.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the 'sstable_preemptive_open_interval_in_mb' configuration option is that it helps in improving read performance by reducing page cache churn and keeping hot rows hot. However, setting this interval too low may increase the frequency of sstable openings, potentially impacting system performance."
