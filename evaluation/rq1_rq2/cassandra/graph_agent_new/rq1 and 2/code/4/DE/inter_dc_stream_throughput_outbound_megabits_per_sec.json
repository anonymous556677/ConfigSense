    "config_description": "Throttles all streaming file transfer between the datacenters, this setting allows users to throttle inter dc stream throughput in addition to throttling all network stream traffic as configured with stream_throughput_outbound_megabits_per_sec When unset, the default is 200 Mbps or 25 MB/s",
    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The configuration 'inter_dc_stream_throughput_outbound_megabits_per_sec' is used to throttle all streaming file transfers between datacenters. It allows users to set a limit on the inter-DC stream throughput, in addition to the overall network stream traffic limit set by 'stream_throughput_outbound_megabits_per_sec'. The code provided includes methods to set and get the value of this configuration, as well as a method to calculate the rate in bytes based on the configured value.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The configuration is triggered whenever the 'setInterDCStreamThroughputMbPerSec' method is called to set a new value for the inter-DC stream throughput. This can happen whenever a user or system administrator decides to change the throttling limit for inter-DC streaming.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of this configuration option is significant as it directly affects the rate at which data can be transferred between datacenters. Setting a lower value for 'inter_dc_stream_throughput_outbound_megabits_per_sec' will result in slower inter-DC streaming speeds, while setting a higher value can potentially saturate the available network bandwidth between datacenters. It is important to carefully configure this option based on the available network capacity and the desired performance of the system."
