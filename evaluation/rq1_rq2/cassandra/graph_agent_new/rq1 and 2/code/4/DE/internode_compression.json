    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The configuration 'internode_compression' is used to determine whether traffic between nodes should be compressed. The function shouldCompressConnection checks if the internodeCompression setting in DatabaseDescriptor is set to 'all' or 'dc' and if the traffic should be compressed based on the local and remote hosts.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The triggering frequency of the 'internode_compression' configuration depends on the frequency of inter-node communication in the system. If there is frequent communication between nodes, this configuration will be triggered more often.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the 'internode_compression' configuration option on the system is related to the network bandwidth and CPU usage. If all traffic is compressed, it can reduce the network bandwidth usage but increase CPU usage. If only traffic between different datacenters is compressed, it can reduce inter-DC bandwidth but still require some CPU usage for compression."
