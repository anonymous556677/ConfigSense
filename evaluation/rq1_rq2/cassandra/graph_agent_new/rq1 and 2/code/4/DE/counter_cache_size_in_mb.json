In case of RF = 1 a counter cache hit will cause Cassandra to skip the read before write entirely. With RF > 1 a counter cache hit will still help to reduce the duration of the lock hold, helping with hot counter cell updates, but will not allow skipping the read entirely. Only the local (clock, count) tuple of a counter cell is kept in memory, not the whole counter, so it's relatively cheap.  NOTE: if you reduce the size, you may not get you hottest keys loaded on startup.  Default value is empty to make it \"auto\" (min(2.5% of Heap (in MB), 50MB)). Set to 0 to disable counter cache. NOTE: if you perform counter deletes and rely on low gcgs, you should disable the counter cache.",

This configuration is retrieved using DatabaseDescriptor.getCounterCacheSizeInMB() method and is used to initialize the counter cache with the specified capacity in megabytes.",

    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The 'counter_cache_size_in_mb' configuration impacts the system by determining the maximum size of the counter cache in memory. A larger cache size can help reduce contention for hot counter cells and improve performance by skipping read operations. However, setting a smaller size may result in not loading the hottest keys on startup. It is also noted that reducing the size may impact performance if counter deletes are performed and low gcgs are relied upon."
