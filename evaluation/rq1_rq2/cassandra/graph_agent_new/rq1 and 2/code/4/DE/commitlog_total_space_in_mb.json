So a small total commitlog space will tend to cause more flush activity on less-active columnfamilies.  The default value is the smaller of 8192, and 1/4 of the total space of the commitlog volume. ",

The code snippet provided calculates the unused capacity by subtracting the current size of the commit log from the total space allocated for commit logs.",

If the total space allocated is too small, it can lead to more frequent flush activities on less-active column families, potentially impacting system performance."
