Enable this option to be able to use UDFs with \"language javascript\" or any custom JSR-223 provider. This option has no effect, if enable_user_defined_functions is false.",
    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The configuration 'enable_scripted_user_defined_functions' is checked in the code to determine if scripted user-defined functions are enabled in Cassandra. If the option is not enabled, an InvalidRequestException is thrown with a message prompting the user to set 'enable_scripted_user_defined_functions=true' in cassandra.yaml to enable scripted user-defined functions.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The configuration 'enable_scripted_user_defined_functions' is triggered whenever the assertUdfsEnabled method is called with a language other than 'java'. This means that the configuration is triggered whenever a request is made to use scripted user-defined functions.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "Enabling the 'enable_scripted_user_defined_functions' configuration allows the use of scripted user-defined functions in Cassandra. This can have a significant impact on the system as it introduces the ability to execute custom JavaScript code within the database. It is noted that enabling this option should be done with caution due to potential security risks."
