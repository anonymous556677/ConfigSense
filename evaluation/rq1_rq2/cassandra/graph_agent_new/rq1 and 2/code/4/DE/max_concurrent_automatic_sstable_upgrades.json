    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The configuration 'max_concurrent_automatic_sstable_upgrades' is used to limit the number of concurrent sstable upgrades that can be automatically triggered after an upgrade. The code snippet shows that the configuration value is retrieved from DatabaseDescriptor.maxConcurrentAutoUpgradeTasks() and is used to check if the current number of background upgrading tasks is within the limit set by this configuration.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The triggering frequency of the configuration depends on the number of background upgrading tasks that are currently running in the system. If the number of tasks is below the limit set by 'max_concurrent_automatic_sstable_upgrades', then the system may trigger an automatic sstable upgrade task.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the 'max_concurrent_automatic_sstable_upgrades' configuration option is that it helps in controlling the number of concurrent sstable upgrades that can be automatically triggered. This can impact the system performance by limiting the resources used for these upgrades and preventing potential overload situations."
