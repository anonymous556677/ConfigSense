This means that only partition information is held on heap and the index entries are read from disk.  Note that this size refers to the size of the serialized index information and not the size of the partition.",

If the entries exceed this size, they will not be held in heap memory, and only partition information will be held on heap while the index entries are read from disk.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The triggering frequency of the 'column_index_cache_size_in_kb' configuration depends on the amount of indexed key cache entries exceeding the specified size limit. It will be triggered whenever new entries are added or existing entries are updated, and the size limit is exceeded.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the 'column_index_cache_size_in_kb' configuration option on the system is that it helps in managing memory usage by controlling the size of indexed key cache entries held in heap. By setting an appropriate size limit, it ensures that only partition information is held in memory, reducing the memory footprint and potentially improving performance by avoiding excessive memory usage."
