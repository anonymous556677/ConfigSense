    "config_description": "Global, per-endpoint and per-connection limits imposed on messages queued for delivery to other nodes and waiting to be processed on arrival from other nodes in the cluster.  These limits are applied to the on-wire size of the message being sent or received.  The basic per-link limit is consumed in isolation before any endpoint or global limit is imposed. Each node-pair has three links: urgent, small and large.  So any given node may have a maximum of N*3*(internode_application_send_queue_capacity_in_bytes+internode_application_receive_queue_capacity_in_bytes) messages queued without any coordination between them although in practice, with token-aware routing, only RF*tokens nodes should need to communicate with significant bandwidth.  The per-endpoint limit is imposed on all messages exceeding the per-link limit, simultaneously with the global limit, on all links to or from a single node in the cluster. The global limit is imposed on all messages exceeding the per-link limit, simultaneously with the per-endpoint limit, on all links to or from any node in the cluster.  internode_application_send_queue_capacity_in_bytes: 4194304                       #4MiB",
    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The configuration code 'internode_application_send_queue_reserve_endpoint_capacity_in_bytes' is used to set the default reserve limits for outbound connections. It checks if the applicationReserveSendQueueEndpointCapacityInBytes and applicationReserveSendQueueGlobalCapacityInBytes are null, and if so, it assigns them values from DatabaseDescriptor or MessagingService respectively. Finally, it returns the updated settings with the applicationReserveSendQueueCapacityInBytes.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The configuration is triggered whenever the 'withDefaultReserveLimits' method is called to set the default reserve limits for outbound connections. The frequency of triggering depends on how often this method is invoked in the system.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The configuration option 'internode_application_send_queue_reserve_endpoint_capacity_in_bytes' impacts the system by setting limits on the size of messages queued for delivery to other nodes and waiting to be processed on arrival. It imposes global, per-endpoint, and per-connection limits on the on-wire size of the messages being sent or received. This helps in managing the message queue size and prevents overload on the system."
