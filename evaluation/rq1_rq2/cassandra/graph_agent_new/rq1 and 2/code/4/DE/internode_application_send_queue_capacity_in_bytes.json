    "config_description": "Global, per-endpoint and per-connection limits imposed on messages queued for delivery to other nodes and waiting to be processed on arrival from other nodes in the cluster.  These limits are applied to the on-wire size of the message being sent or received.  The basic per-link limit is consumed in isolation before any endpoint or global limit is imposed. Each node-pair has three links: urgent, small and large.  So any given node may have a maximum of N*3*(internode_application_send_queue_capacity_in_bytes+internode_application_receive_queue_capacity_in_bytes) messages queued without any coordination between them although in practice, with token-aware routing, only RF*tokens nodes should need to communicate with significant bandwidth.  The per-endpoint limit is imposed on all messages exceeding the per-link limit, simultaneously with the global limit, on all links to or from a single node in the cluster. The global limit is imposed on all messages exceeding the per-link limit, simultaneously with the per-endpoint limit, on all links to or from any node in the cluster. ",

This configuration sets the limit on the size of messages queued for delivery to other nodes and waiting to be processed on arrival from other nodes in the cluster.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The triggering frequency of this configuration depends on the message traffic between nodes in the cluster. It is triggered whenever a message is queued for delivery or received from another node, and the size of the message exceeds the specified limit set by internode_application_send_queue_capacity_in_bytes.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the internode_application_send_queue_capacity_in_bytes configuration option is significant as it sets the limit on the size of messages queued for delivery and received from other nodes. Exceeding this limit can lead to message processing delays, increased memory usage, and potential performance degradation in the system."
