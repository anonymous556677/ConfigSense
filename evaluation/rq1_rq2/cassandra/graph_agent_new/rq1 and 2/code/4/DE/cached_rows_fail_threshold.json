    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The configuration 'cached_rows_fail_threshold' is used in the code to set the threshold for the number of cached replica rows that can fail before triggering a specific protection mechanism against inconsistent replica filtering. It is used in the ReplicaFilteringProtection class constructor along with 'cached_rows_warn_threshold' to handle potentially out-of-date rows.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The triggering frequency of the 'cached_rows_fail_threshold' configuration depends on the number of cached replica rows that fail to respond during the resolution process with replica filtering protection. The configuration is triggered when the number of failed rows exceeds the specified threshold.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the 'cached_rows_fail_threshold' configuration option on the system is that it helps in ensuring data consistency by identifying potentially out-of-date rows and handling them appropriately. Setting a proper threshold for this configuration can improve the reliability and accuracy of query results by preventing outdated data from being returned."
