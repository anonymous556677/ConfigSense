This speeds up the network transfer significantly subject to throttling specified by stream_throughput_outbound_megabits_per_sec. Enabling this will reduce the GC pressure on sending and receiving node. When unset, the default is enabled. While this feature tries to keep the disks balanced, it cannot guarantee it. This feature will be automatically disabled if internode encryption is enabled.",

However, it may not guarantee disk balance and will be automatically disabled if internode encryption is enabled."
