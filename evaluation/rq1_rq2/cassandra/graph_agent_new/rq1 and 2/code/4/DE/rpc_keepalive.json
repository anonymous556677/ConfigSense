    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The rpc_keepalive configuration in the code determines whether keepalive on rpc/native connections is enabled or disabled. It is set based on the value of DatabaseDescriptor.getRpcKeepAlive() and is used in the creation of the PipelineConfigurator.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The triggering frequency of the rpc_keepalive configuration in the system depends on when the Server class is instantiated or when the configuration is updated. It is typically triggered during the initialization of the server.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the rpc_keepalive configuration option on the system is significant as it affects the behavior of rpc/native connections. Enabling keepalive can help in maintaining long-lived connections and reducing connection setup overhead, while disabling it may result in more frequent connection establishment."
