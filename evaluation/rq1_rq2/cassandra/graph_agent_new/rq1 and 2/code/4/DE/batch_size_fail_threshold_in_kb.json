    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The triggering frequency of the 'batch_size_fail_threshold_in_kb' configuration depends on the size of the batches being processed. If batches frequently exceed the threshold, the configuration will be triggered more often.",

By setting an appropriate threshold, the system can better manage the processing of batches and avoid potential bottlenecks."
