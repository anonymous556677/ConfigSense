    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The configuration 'memtable_heap_space_in_mb' is used to set the total permitted memory to use for memtables in the system.

    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The triggering frequency of the 'memtable_heap_space_in_mb' configuration in the system depends on the memtable_cleanup_threshold value set in the configuration. When the total memory used for memtables exceeds the limit set by 'memtable_heap_space_in_mb', Cassandra will stop accepting writes until a flush completes. The frequency of triggering a flush is determined by the memtable_cleanup_threshold value.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the 'memtable_heap_space_in_mb' configuration option on the system is significant as it directly affects the memory usage for memtables. If the configured limit is too low, it can lead to frequent flushes and potentially impact the performance of the system. On the other hand, setting a higher limit can allow for more data to be stored in memory but may also increase the risk of running out of memory if not managed properly."
