    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The configuration 'max_hints_file_size_in_mb' is used in the code to determine the maximum size allowed for a single hints file. It is retrieved using DatabaseDescriptor.getMaxHintsFileSize() method and then used to check the size of the session buffer in the flushInternal method.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The configuration is triggered whenever the flushInternal method is called, which depends on the frequency of hints being written and the size of the write buffer. The frequency of triggering can vary based on the workload and amount of data being processed.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the 'max_hints_file_size_in_mb' configuration option is significant as it determines the maximum size allowed for a single hints file. Setting this value too low may result in frequent file creations and deletions, impacting performance and disk space usage. On the other hand, setting it too high may lead to large files that could potentially cause issues with disk space and file system limitations."
