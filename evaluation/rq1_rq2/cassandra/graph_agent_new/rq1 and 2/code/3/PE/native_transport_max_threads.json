    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'native_transport_max_threads' configuration is performance-sensitive. The configuration is directly related to the 'requestExecutor' thread pool initialization in the code context. The 'requestExecutor' is used to submit tasks for processing requests, which can have a significant impact on system performance. The number of threads in the thread pool can directly affect the concurrency and throughput of request processing, leading to notable performance variations at the system level. Therefore, any changes to 'native_transport_max_threads' can have a substantial impact on the overall performance of the system."
