{
    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'cdc_free_space_check_interval_ms' is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the 'cdc_free_space_check_interval_ms' configuration directly affects the performance of the system at the system level. The code context provided shows that this configuration is related to the CDCSizeTracker, which is responsible for tracking the total disk usage of the CDC subsystem. The CDCSizeTracker involves time-extensive operations such as size recalculation and directory walk to determine potential deletions, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Additionally, the configuration involves memory-expensive operations such as maintaining the size of unflushed CommitLogSegments with CDC data, further contributing to its performance sensitivity."
