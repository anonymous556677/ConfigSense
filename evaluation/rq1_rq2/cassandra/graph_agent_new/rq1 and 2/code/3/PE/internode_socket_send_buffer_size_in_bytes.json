    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'internode_socket_send_buffer_size_in_bytes' is performance-sensitive. The code context provided shows that this configuration directly affects the socket send buffer size, which can have a substantial impact on network performance at the system level. Adjusting the socket send buffer size can significantly impact the time-expensive operation of sending data over the network. Therefore, changes to this configuration can lead to notable performance variations in terms of network communication."
