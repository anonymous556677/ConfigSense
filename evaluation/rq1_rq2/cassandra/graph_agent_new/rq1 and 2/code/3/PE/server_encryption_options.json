    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'server_encryption_options' configuration option is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the configuration involves setting up SSL contexts and managing SSL certificates, which are time-expensive and memory-expensive operations. These operations directly impact system performance at the system level by consuming resources and affecting network communication. Additionally, the configuration code includes operations that initialize SSL contexts, validate SSL certificates, and create Netty SslContext instances, all of which contribute to notable performance variations at the system level."
