    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'internode_application_send_queue_reserve_endpoint_capacity_in_bytes' is performance-sensitive. This is because the code context shows that this configuration directly affects the application's send queue capacity, which can have a substantial impact on the system's performance at the system level. The configuration involves performance-related operations such as setting the applicationReserveSendQueueEndpointCapacityInBytes and applicationReserveSendQueueGlobalCapacityInBytes based on certain conditions, which can lead to notable performance variations in terms of memory consumption and execution time."
