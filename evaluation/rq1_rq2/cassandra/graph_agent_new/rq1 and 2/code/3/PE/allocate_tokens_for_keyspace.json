    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'allocate_tokens_for_keyspace' is performance-sensitive. This is because the code context provided includes operations that directly impact system performance, such as token allocation algorithms and token generation. These operations are time-expensive and memory-expensive, leading to notable performance variations at the system level. Additionally, the configuration involves checking for user-specified tokens, handling allocation keyspace and local replication factor, and generating random tokens, all of which contribute to significant performance impacts."
