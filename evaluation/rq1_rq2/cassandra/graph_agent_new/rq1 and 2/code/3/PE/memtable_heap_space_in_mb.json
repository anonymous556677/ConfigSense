    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'memtable_heap_space_in_mb' configuration option is performance-sensitive. This is because the value of 'heapLimit' is directly dependent on the 'memtable_heap_space_in_mb' configuration setting, which in turn affects the memory allocation for the MemtablePool. The memory allocation operations in the code snippet are time-expensive and memory-expensive, as they involve bitwise left shift operations and memory allocation based on the configuration value. Any changes in the 'memtable_heap_space_in_mb' configuration can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, making it a performance-sensitive configuration."
