    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'ideal_consistency_level' is performance-sensitive. This is because the 'ideal_consistency_level' directly affects the performance of the system at the system level by tracking the ideal consistency level for write operations. The code context shows that the 'ideal_consistency_level' is used to construct response handlers based on the specified consistency level, which can have a notable impact on the execution time and memory consumption of the system. Additionally, the 'ideal_consistency_level' configuration involves performance-related operations such as constructing response handlers and tracking consistency levels, which are time-expensive and memory-expensive operations leading to notable performance variations at the system level."
