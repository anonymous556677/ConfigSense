{
    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'num_tokens' is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the 'getNumTokens()' method is called multiple times within the code context, specifically in the 'validateTransientReplication' method and the 'getBootstrapTokens' method. This method call directly affects the behavior of the system by throwing exceptions based on the value returned by 'getNumTokens()'. Additionally, the 'getNumTokens()' method is used in conditional statements that control the flow of the program, indicating that changes in the 'num_tokens' configuration can have a significant impact on the system performance at the system level."
