{
    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'auto_snapshot' configuration option is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the 'auto_snapshot' configuration directly impacts the system performance at the system level. The code related to the 'auto_snapshot' configuration involves time-expensive and memory-expensive operations such as taking snapshots, truncating data, and flushing memtables. These operations can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, affecting the overall performance of the system. Additionally, the 'auto_snapshot' configuration involves operations that can be time-consuming and memory-intensive, further emphasizing its performance sensitivity."
