    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'counter_write_request_timeout_in_ms' is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the 'counter_write_request_timeout_in_ms' configuration directly affects the timeout values for various RPC operations in the code context provided. These timeout values are crucial for the performance of the system as they determine how long the system waits for a response before timing out. Any changes to the 'counter_write_request_timeout_in_ms' configuration can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, making it a performance-sensitive configuration."
