{
    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'file_cache_enabled' is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the 'file_cache_enabled' configuration directly impacts the system performance at the system level. The code context shows that the 'file_cache_enabled' configuration affects the creation of the ChunkCache instance, which in turn affects the caching behavior and memory consumption of the system. Additionally, the 'file_cache_enabled' configuration involves performance-related operations such as cache initialization and cache invalidation, which are time-expensive and memory-expensive operations that lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
