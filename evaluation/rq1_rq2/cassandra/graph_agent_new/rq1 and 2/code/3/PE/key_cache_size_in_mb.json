    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'key_cache_size_in_mb' is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the 'key_cache_size_in_mb' directly affects the capacity of the key cache, which in turn impacts the memory consumption of the system. The code snippet provided shows that the key cache size in MB is used to initialize the key cache, and a large key cache size can lead to increased memory usage. Additionally, the key cache size influences the scheduling of cache saving operations, which can have a significant impact on system performance. Therefore, the 'key_cache_size_in_mb' configuration is considered performance-sensitive as it directly and substantially affects system performance at the memory consumption level."
