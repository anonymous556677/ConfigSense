    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'native_transport_allow_older_protocols' is performance-sensitive. This is because the 'native_transport_allow_older_protocols' configuration directly affects the protocol version used in the communication between the client and server. The code snippets related to this configuration involve decoding the protocol version and flags, which are time-expensive operations. Additionally, the configuration can lead to notable performance variations at the system level by impacting the handling of CQL messages and the overall communication efficiency between the client and server."
