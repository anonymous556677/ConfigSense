    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'allocate_tokens_for_local_replication_factor' is performance-sensitive. This is because the code context provided shows that the configuration involves operations that directly impact system performance, such as token allocation algorithms and token generation. These operations are time-expensive and memory-expensive, leading to notable performance variations at the system level. Additionally, the configuration can affect the distribution of tokens for replication factors, which can have a significant impact on system performance."
