    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'native_transport_max_frame_size_in_mb' is performance-sensitive. This is because the 'native_transport_max_frame_size_in_mb' configuration directly affects the maximum total length of the message envelope in the system. The code context related to this configuration involves operations that handle the extraction, encoding, and decoding of message headers and bodies, which are time-expensive and memory-expensive operations. Changes in the 'native_transport_max_frame_size_in_mb' configuration can lead to notable performance variations at the system level due to the impact on message size and processing overhead."
