    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'compaction_throughput_mb_per_sec' is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the 'compaction_throughput_mb_per_sec' directly affects the rate limiter for compaction operations in the system. The code context shows that this configuration is used to set the rate limit for compaction operations, which are time-expensive and memory-expensive operations. Therefore, any changes in this configuration can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, making it performance-sensitive."
