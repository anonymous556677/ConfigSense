    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'stream_throughput_outbound_megabits_per_sec' is performance-sensitive. This is because the 'setStreamThroughputMbPerSec' method directly updates the stream throughput outbound megabits per second value in the DatabaseDescriptor, which in turn affects the rate at which streams are processed. The 'calculateRateInBytes' method also calculates the rate in bytes based on the stream throughput outbound megabits per second value, showing that this configuration directly impacts the performance of stream processing. Therefore, any changes to this configuration can lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
