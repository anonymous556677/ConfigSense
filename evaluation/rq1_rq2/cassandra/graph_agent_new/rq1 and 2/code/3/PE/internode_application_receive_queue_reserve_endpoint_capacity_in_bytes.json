{
    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'internode_application_receive_queue_reserve_endpoint_capacity_in_bytes' is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the configuration directly affects the system's performance at the system level. The code context shows that this configuration is used to set the endpoint capacity in bytes for the internode application receive queue reserve. This capacity directly impacts the memory utilization and message processing efficiency of the system, which are critical factors for system performance. Additionally, the code snippet related to this configuration involves handling inbound and outbound messaging, which are time-expensive and memory-expensive operations, further emphasizing the performance sensitivity of this configuration."
