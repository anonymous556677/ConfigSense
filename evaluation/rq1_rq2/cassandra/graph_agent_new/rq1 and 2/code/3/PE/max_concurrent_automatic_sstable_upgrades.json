    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'max_concurrent_automatic_sstable_upgrades' is performance-sensitive. This is because the 'maxConcurrentAutoUpgradeTasks()' method directly impacts the number of concurrent automatic sstable upgrades that can be performed, which can have a significant effect on system performance. The code context shows that this configuration is used to limit the number of upgrade tasks that can run concurrently, which can have a notable performance impact at the system level by controlling the resource utilization and potentially preventing performance bottlenecks."
