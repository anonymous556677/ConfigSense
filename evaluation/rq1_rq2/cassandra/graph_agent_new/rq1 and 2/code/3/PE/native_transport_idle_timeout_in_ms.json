    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'native_transport_idle_timeout_in_ms' is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the 'idleTimeout' value obtained from the configuration directly affects the idle timeout of the native transport connection. This idle timeout setting can have a significant impact on system performance, as it determines when client connections should be closed after a certain period of inactivity. The code snippet shows that if the 'idleTimeout' value is greater than 0, an IdleStateHandler is added to the pipeline, which closes client connections after the specified idle timeout. This operation is time-expensive and can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, making the configuration performance-sensitive."
