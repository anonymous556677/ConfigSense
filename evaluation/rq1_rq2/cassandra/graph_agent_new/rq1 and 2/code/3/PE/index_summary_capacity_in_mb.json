    "Reason": "The configuration option 'index_summary_capacity_in_mb' is not performance-sensitive. The code context provided does not contain any performance-related operations that are time-expensive or memory-expensive. The configuration setting only involves setting the memory pool size and resize interval for the index summary manager, which are not directly and substantially affecting system performance at the system level."
