    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'internode_streaming_tcp_user_timeout_in_ms' is performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly affects the system performance at the system level by setting a timeout value for processing incoming stream messages. The code snippet related to this configuration involves time-expensive operations such as calculating latency and checking if the latency exceeds the timeout value. These operations can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, making the configuration performance-sensitive."
