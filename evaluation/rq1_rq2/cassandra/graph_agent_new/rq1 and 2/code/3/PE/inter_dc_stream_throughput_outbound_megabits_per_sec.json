    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'inter_dc_stream_throughput_outbound_megabits_per_sec' is performance-sensitive. This is because the code context provided shows that this configuration directly affects the throughput of inter-DC streams by setting and getting the value of 'InterDCStreamThroughputOutboundMegabitsPerSec' in the DatabaseDescriptor. The 'calculateInterDCRateInBytes' method also calculates the inter-DC rate based on this configuration. Any changes in this configuration can have a direct impact on the performance of inter-DC stream throughput, making it a performance-sensitive configuration."
