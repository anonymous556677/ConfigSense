    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'internode_tcp_connect_timeout_in_ms' is performance-sensitive. The code context provided shows that this configuration directly affects the timeout value for TCP connections between nodes in a distributed system. Setting a higher timeout value can lead to longer waiting times for establishing connections, which can have a notable impact on the overall system performance. Additionally, the code snippet indicates that this configuration involves time-expensive operations related to fetching the timeout value from the DatabaseDescriptor, which can contribute to performance variations at the system level."
