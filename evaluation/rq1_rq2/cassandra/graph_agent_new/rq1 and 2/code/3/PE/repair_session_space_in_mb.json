    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'repair_session_space_in_mb' is performance-sensitive. This is because the 'repair_session_space_in_mb' configuration directly affects the amount of memory allocated for creating Merkle Trees during the repair process. The code snippet shows that the available memory for creating Merkle Trees is calculated based on this configuration value. If the 'repair_session_space_in_mb' value is set too low, it can lead to memory constraints and potentially impact the performance of the repair process. Therefore, this configuration has a direct and substantial impact on system performance at the system level."
