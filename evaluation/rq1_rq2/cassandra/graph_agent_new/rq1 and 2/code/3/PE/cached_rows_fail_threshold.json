    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'cached_rows_fail_threshold' is performance-sensitive. This is because the 'cached_rows_fail_threshold' configuration directly affects the behavior of the 'ReplicaFilteringProtection' process, which involves time-expensive operations like short-read protection, merge listeners, and lazy completion of potentially out-of-date rows. The configuration value is used to set the fail threshold for cached replica rows, which can significantly impact the performance of the system by determining when potentially out-of-date rows are considered failed. Therefore, changes in this configuration can lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
