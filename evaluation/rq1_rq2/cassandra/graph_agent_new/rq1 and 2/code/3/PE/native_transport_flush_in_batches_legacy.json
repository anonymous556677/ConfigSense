    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'native_transport_flush_in_batches_legacy' does not directly involve any performance-related operations that are time-extensive or memory-extensive within its related code. The code context provided mainly focuses on setting up server configurations and event notifiers, which do not have a significant impact on system performance at the system level. Therefore, based on the code context analysis, this configuration is not performance-sensitive."
