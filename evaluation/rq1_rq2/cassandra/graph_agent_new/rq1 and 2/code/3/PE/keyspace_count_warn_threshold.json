    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'keyspace_count_warn_threshold' is performance-sensitive. This is because the 'keyspaceCount' variable is directly dependent on the 'keyspaceCountWarnThreshold' configuration value from 'DatabaseDescriptor'. If the 'keyspaceCount' exceeds the 'keyspaceCountWarnThreshold', it triggers a warning message and potentially impacts the performance of schema-dependent cluster operations. This configuration directly affects system performance at the system level by potentially slowing down operations, making it performance-sensitive."
