    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'concurrent_materialized_view_writes' is not performance-sensitive. The code context provided does not contain any performance-sensitive operations related to this configuration. The ViewManager class mainly deals with managing views for a single ColumnFamilyStore and handling updates to views. The developer's comments also suggest that the related operations are not performance-sensitive. Therefore, based on the code context and developer's information, it can be concluded that this configuration does not directly and substantially affect system performance at the system level."
