    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'cas_contention_timeout_in_ms' is performance-sensitive. The code context provided shows that this configuration directly affects the performance of the system at the system level. The 'doPaxos' method, which uses the 'cas_contention_timeout_in_ms' configuration, performs Paxos rounds for a given proposal and retries until the timeout. The timeout value is based on the 'cas_contention_timeout_in_ms' configuration, and it directly impacts the performance of the Paxos protocol. The timeout value influences the duration of the Paxos rounds, which can have a significant impact on system performance, making this configuration performance-sensitive."
