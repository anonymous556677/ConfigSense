    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'file_cache_size_in_mb' is performance-sensitive. The code context shows that the 'file_cache_size_in_mb' configuration directly affects the calculation of the cache size in the 'ChunkCache' class. The cache size calculation involves memory-expensive operations that can significantly impact system performance at the system level. Additionally, the 'file_cache_size_in_mb' configuration is used to set the memory usage threshold in the 'BufferPools' class, further emphasizing its performance sensitivity."
