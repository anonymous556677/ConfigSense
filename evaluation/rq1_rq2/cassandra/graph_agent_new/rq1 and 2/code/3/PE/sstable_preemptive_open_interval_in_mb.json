    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'sstable_preemptive_open_interval_in_mb' is performance-sensitive. From the code context provided, we can see that this configuration directly affects the calculation of the open interval for SSTables, which can have a significant impact on system performance. The 'calculateOpenInterval' method shows that the value of 'sstable_preemptive_open_interval_in_mb' is multiplied by a large constant (1L << 20), indicating that this configuration can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Additionally, the conditional check for disabling early opening and setting the interval to Long.MAX_VALUE further emphasizes the importance of this configuration in system performance."
