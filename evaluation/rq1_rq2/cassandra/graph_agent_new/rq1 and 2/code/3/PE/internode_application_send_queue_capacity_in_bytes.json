    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'internode_application_send_queue_capacity_in_bytes' is performance-sensitive. This is because the code context shows that the configuration directly impacts the application's send queue capacity, which can have a significant effect on system performance. The method 'applicationSendQueueCapacityInBytes' returns the value of 'internode_application_send_queue_capacity_in_bytes' if it is not null, otherwise it retrieves the value from 'DatabaseDescriptor.getInternodeApplicationSendQueueCapacityInBytes()'. This configuration is crucial for determining the capacity of the send queue, which can affect the performance of data transmission between nodes in the system. Therefore, any changes in this configuration can lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
