    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'max_hints_delivery_threads' is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the 'maxDeliveryThreads' configuration directly affects the number of threads used for delivering hints in the system. The code snippet shows that the 'maxDeliveryThreads' value is used to initialize the 'HintsDispatchExecutor', which is responsible for dispatching hints to nodes. Having a higher value for 'maxDeliveryThreads' can lead to increased parallelism in hint delivery, potentially impacting system performance significantly. Therefore, this configuration can cause notable performance variations at the system level."
