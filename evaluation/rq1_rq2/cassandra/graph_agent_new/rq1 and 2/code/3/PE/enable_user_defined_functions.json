    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'enable_user_defined_functions' is performance-sensitive. This is because the code context provided shows that the configuration directly affects the behavior of the system by enabling or disabling user-defined functions and scripted user-defined functions. Enabling or disabling these functions can have a significant impact on the execution time and memory consumption of the system, leading to notable performance variations at the system level. Therefore, the configuration involves performance-related operations that are time-extensive and memory-extensive, making it performance-sensitive."
