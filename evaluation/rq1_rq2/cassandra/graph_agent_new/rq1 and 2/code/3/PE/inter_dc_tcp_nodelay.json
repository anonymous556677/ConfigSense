    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'inter_dc_tcp_nodelay' is performance-sensitive. The code context provided shows that this configuration is directly related to the TCP no delay setting for inter-DC communication. This setting can have a significant impact on system performance, especially in scenarios where low latency communication is crucial. By enabling or disabling TCP no delay, the system can experience notable performance variations at the system level, making this configuration performance-sensitive."
