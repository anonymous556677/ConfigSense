    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'tracetype_query_ttl' is performance-sensitive. This is because the 'Tracing' class contains methods and operations related to tracing and tracking query sessions, which can have a direct impact on system performance. The 'Tracing' class involves operations like starting new sessions, stopping sessions, tracing messages, and handling trace data, all of which are time-expensive and memory-expensive operations. These operations directly affect system performance at the system level by introducing notable performance variations."
