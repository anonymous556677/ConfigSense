{
    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'enable_drop_compact_storage' is performance-sensitive. This is because the code context shows that the configuration directly affects the system performance by enabling or disabling the 'DROP COMPACT STORAGE' feature. This feature has implications on the table storage format and can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, especially when dealing with compact tables. The code snippet related to this configuration involves time-expensive operations such as validation checks and setting flags based on table properties, which can impact execution time and memory consumption significantly. Therefore, the configuration is classified as performance-sensitive based on its direct and substantial impact on system performance."
