    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'index_summary_resize_interval_in_minutes' is performance-sensitive. The 'DatabaseDescriptor.getIndexSummaryResizeIntervalInMinutes()' method is being called to retrieve the value of the configuration, which indicates that it is used in the context of setting the resize interval for the index summary manager. This interval directly impacts the frequency at which the index summary is resized, which can have a significant impact on memory consumption and execution time. Therefore, any changes to this configuration can lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
