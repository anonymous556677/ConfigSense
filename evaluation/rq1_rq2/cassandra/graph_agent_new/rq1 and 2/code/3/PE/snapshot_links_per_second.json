    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'snapshot_links_per_second' is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the 'snapshot_links_per_second' configuration directly affects the rate at which snapshots are taken in the system, which can have a substantial impact on system performance. The code context shows that this configuration is used to create a RateLimiter, which can significantly impact the execution time and memory consumption of the system. Therefore, any changes to the 'snapshot_links_per_second' configuration can lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
