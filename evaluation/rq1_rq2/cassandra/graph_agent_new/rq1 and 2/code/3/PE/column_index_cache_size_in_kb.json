    "Reason": "The configuration option 'column_index_cache_size_in_kb' is not performance-sensitive. The code snippet provided simply retrieves the column index cache size in kilobytes from the DatabaseDescriptor. This operation does not involve any time-expensive or memory-expensive operations that would lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Therefore, the configuration does not directly and substantially affect system performance."
