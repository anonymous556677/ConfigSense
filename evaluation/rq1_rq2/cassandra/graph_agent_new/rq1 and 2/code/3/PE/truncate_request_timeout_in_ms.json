    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'truncate_request_timeout_in_ms' is performance-sensitive. The code context provided shows that the configuration is directly related to setting timeouts for truncating operations. Truncating operations can be time-expensive and can significantly impact system performance if the timeout values are not properly configured. The code snippet includes operations that involve waiting for a timeout and throwing exceptions if the operation exceeds the timeout. These operations can have a notable performance impact at the system level, making the configuration performance-sensitive."
