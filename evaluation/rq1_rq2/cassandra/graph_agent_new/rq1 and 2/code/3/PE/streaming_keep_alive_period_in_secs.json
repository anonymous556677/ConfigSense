    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'streaming_keep_alive_period_in_secs' is performance-sensitive. This is because the value of 'streaming_keep_alive_period_in_secs' directly affects the scheduling of keep-alive tasks in the code. The 'keepAlivePeriod' is set based on this configuration, and it is used to schedule tasks at fixed intervals. Changing the value of 'streaming_keep_alive_period_in_secs' can significantly impact the frequency of these tasks, leading to notable performance variations at the system level. Therefore, this configuration is considered performance-sensitive."
