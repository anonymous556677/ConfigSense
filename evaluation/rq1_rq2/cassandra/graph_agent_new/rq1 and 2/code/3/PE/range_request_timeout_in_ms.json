{
    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'range_request_timeout_in_ms' is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the 'getRangeRpcTimeout' method is being called multiple times within the code context provided. This method directly affects system performance by retrieving the range RPC timeout value from the DatabaseDescriptor, which involves time-expensive operations. Additionally, the 'getRangeRpcTimeout' method is being used in critical code paths such as index building support, indicating that changes to this configuration can lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
