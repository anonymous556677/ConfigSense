    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'key_cache_save_period' is classified as performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the 'key_cache_save_period' directly affects the scheduling of cache saving operations, which can have a significant impact on system performance. The code snippet shows that the 'keyCache.scheduleSaving' method is called with the 'keyCacheSavePeriod' value from the configuration, indicating that the frequency of cache saving is determined by this configuration. Since cache saving operations can be time-expensive and memory-expensive, the 'key_cache_save_period' configuration can lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
