{
    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'memtable_cleanup_threshold' is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the 'cleaningThreshold' parameter directly influences the behavior of the MemtablePool creation process, affecting memory allocation and cleanup operations. The value of 'cleaningThreshold' determines when the MemtableCleaner function is triggered, which can have a significant impact on system performance by affecting memory usage and cleanup efficiency. Therefore, any changes to the 'memtable_cleanup_threshold' configuration can lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
