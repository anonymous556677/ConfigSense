    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'cdc_total_space_in_mb' is performance-sensitive. The code context provided shows that the configuration directly affects the amount of space allocated for CDC (Change Data Capture) in the system by multiplying the value of 'CDCSpaceInMB' with 1024 * 1024. This operation is time-expensive as it involves multiple arithmetic operations and memory-expensive as it allocates a large amount of memory. Any changes in this configuration can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, making it performance-sensitive."
