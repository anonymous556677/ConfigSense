    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'dynamic_snitch_reset_interval_in_ms' is performance-sensitive. This is because the 'dynamicResetInterval' configuration parameter directly affects the scheduling of tasks that involve time-expensive operations (such as updating and resetting scores) at the system level. The code context shows that the 'dynamicResetInterval' is used to schedule tasks with fixed delays, which can have a notable impact on system performance. Additionally, changes to the 'dynamicResetInterval' configuration parameter trigger the cancellation and rescheduling of tasks, indicating that it has a direct and substantial effect on system performance."
