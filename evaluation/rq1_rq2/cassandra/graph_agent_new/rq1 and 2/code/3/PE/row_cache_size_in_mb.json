    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'row_cache_size_in_mb' is performance-sensitive. The code context provided shows that the 'row_cache_size_in_mb' configuration directly affects the capacity of the row cache in megabytes. This directly impacts the memory consumption of the system, as it determines the amount of memory allocated for caching rows. Changes in this configuration can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, as it influences the efficiency of caching and retrieval operations. Therefore, based on the code context and the nature of the configuration, it is classified as performance-sensitive."
