    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'gc_warn_threshold_in_ms' is performance-sensitive. This is because the 'gc_warn_threshold_in_ms' configuration directly affects the Garbage Collection process in the system, which is a critical performance-related operation. The code context provided shows that the configuration is used to set a threshold for garbage collection, which can significantly impact the system's memory consumption and execution time. Therefore, any changes in this configuration can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, making it performance-sensitive."
