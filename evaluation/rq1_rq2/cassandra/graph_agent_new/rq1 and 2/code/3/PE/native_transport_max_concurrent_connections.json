    "classification_result": "Performance-insensitive with 100% confidence",
    "Reason": "The configuration option for the maximum number of concurrent client connections is performance-insensitive because it only sets a limit on the number of client connections and does not directly impact system performance. Different concurrent client connections do not affect the overall performance of the system."
