    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'internode_application_receive_queue_capacity_in_bytes' is performance-sensitive. This is because the 'applicationReceiveQueueCapacityInBytes' configuration parameter directly affects the 'application receive queue capacity' at the system level. The code context shows that this configuration parameter is checked against a minimum value and is used to set the capacity for inbound messages. The 'applicationReceiveQueueCapacityInBytes' configuration parameter directly influences the memory consumption and the handling of inbound messages, which can have a notable impact on system performance."
