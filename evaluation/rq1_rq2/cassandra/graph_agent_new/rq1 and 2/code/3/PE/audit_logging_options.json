    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'audit_logging_options' configuration is performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly impacts the system performance by enabling or disabling audit logging, which involves time-expensive operations such as creating audit loggers, initializing audit logs, and enabling audit logs. The code snippets related to the 'audit_logging_options' configuration show that it affects the execution time and memory consumption significantly at the system level, leading to notable performance variations."
