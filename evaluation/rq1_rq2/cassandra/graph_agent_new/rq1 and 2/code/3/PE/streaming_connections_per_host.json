    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'streaming_connections_per_host' is performance-sensitive. The code context shows that this configuration directly impacts the number of streaming connections per host during bootstrap and rebuild processes. This can have a notable performance impact at the system level, especially when handling a large number of files and sessions concurrently. The configuration-related code involves time-expensive operations such as adding ranges, handling file progress, and completing sessions, which can lead to significant performance variations in terms of execution time and memory consumption."
