    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'internode_authenticator' configuration option is performance-sensitive. This is because the 'internode_authenticator' configuration directly affects the system's internode communication authentication mechanism, which is a critical component for performance. The code context shows that the 'internode_authenticator' configuration is used to set the internode authenticator for network communication. This authentication process can involve time-expensive operations such as validation and role management, which can significantly impact system performance at the network level. Therefore, any changes or misconfigurations in the 'internode_authenticator' can lead to notable performance variations in the system."
