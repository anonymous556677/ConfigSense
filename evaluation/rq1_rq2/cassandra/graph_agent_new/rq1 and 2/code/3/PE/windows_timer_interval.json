    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'windows_timer_interval' is performance-sensitive. This is because the code context shows that the 'windows_timer_interval' directly affects the system timer on Windows, impacting timer intervals, thread scheduling, driver interrupts, etc. The configuration involves time-extensive operations like adjusting the system timer from default 15ms to 1ms, which can have a notable performance variation at the system level. Additionally, the configuration-related code includes operations that contribute to execution time and memory consumption, making it performance-sensitive."
