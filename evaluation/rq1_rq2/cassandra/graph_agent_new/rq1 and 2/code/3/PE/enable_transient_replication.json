    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'enable_transient_replication' is performance-sensitive. This is because the code context provided contains operations that directly impact system performance, such as checking if transient replication is enabled and throwing exceptions based on the configuration. Enabling transient replication can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, especially when dealing with transient replicas and mixed version clusters. The configuration involves time-expensive and memory-expensive operations that can significantly affect system performance, making it performance-sensitive."
