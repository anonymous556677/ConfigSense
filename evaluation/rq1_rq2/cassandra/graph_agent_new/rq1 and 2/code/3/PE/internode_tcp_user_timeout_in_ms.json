    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'internode_tcp_user_timeout_in_ms' is performance-sensitive. This is because the 'tcpUserTimeoutInMS' method directly impacts the system performance by returning different values based on the connection category, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The code context shows that this configuration involves performance-related operations that are time-expensive, as it retrieves the internode TCP user timeout value from the DatabaseDescriptor. Therefore, any changes to this configuration can have a significant impact on system performance."
