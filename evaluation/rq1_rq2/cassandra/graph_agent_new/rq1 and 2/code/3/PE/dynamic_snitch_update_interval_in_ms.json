    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'dynamic_snitch_update_interval_in_ms' is performance-sensitive. This is because the 'dynamic_snitch_update_interval_in_ms' configuration directly affects the update and reset scheduler tasks, which are time-expensive operations. The code context shows that changing the dynamic update interval and reset interval significantly impacts the scheduling of these tasks, leading to notable performance variations at the system level. Additionally, the configuration involves setting dynamic update interval, dynamic reset interval, and dynamic badness threshold, which are critical parameters affecting system performance. Therefore, the configuration is considered performance-sensitive based on the significant impact on performance-related operations and system-level performance."
