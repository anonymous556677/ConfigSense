    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'flush_compression' is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the 'flush_compression' configuration directly affects system performance at the system level by determining the compression parameters used during the flushing operation. The code snippet provided shows that the choice of compression algorithm can have a significant impact on the throughput of the flushing process, especially for large tables. The configuration-related code explicitly mentions the importance of selecting a faster compressor to prevent potential blockages in write operations during flushes. Therefore, the 'flush_compression' configuration involves performance-related operations that are time-extensive and memory-extensive, leading to notable performance variations at the system level."
