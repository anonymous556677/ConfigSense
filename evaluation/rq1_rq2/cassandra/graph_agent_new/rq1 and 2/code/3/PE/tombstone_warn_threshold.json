    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'tombstone_warn_threshold' is not performance-sensitive. The code context related to this configuration does not involve any performance-related operations that are time-expensive or memory-expensive. The code mainly deals with reading commands, data serialization, and handling of iterators, which do not have a direct and substantial impact on system performance at the system level."
