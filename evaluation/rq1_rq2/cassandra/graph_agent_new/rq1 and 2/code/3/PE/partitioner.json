    "classification_result": "Performance-insensitive with 100% confidence",
    "Reason": "The partitioner configuration option is related to distributing groups of rows across nodes in the cluster based on partition key. Changing the partitioner does not directly impact system performance, but rather affects data distribution and compatibility. It does not involve any performance-related operations or time-dependent aspects of system operation."
