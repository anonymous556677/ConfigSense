    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'internode_compression' does not directly involve any performance-related operations that are time-extensive or memory-extensive within its related code. The code snippet provided only checks the value of 'internodeCompression' in the DatabaseDescriptor class and returns a boolean based on the comparison. This operation is not time-expensive or memory-expensive, and it does not lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Therefore, the configuration is not considered performance-sensitive."
