    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'repaired_data_tracking_for_range_reads_enabled' is performance-sensitive. The code context shows that this configuration directly affects the performance by enabling or disabling data tracking for range reads. This configuration involves performance-related operations such as checking if the tracking is enabled and filtering full replicas, which can have a notable impact on system performance at the system level. Enabling data tracking for range reads can lead to additional memory and time expenses, which can result in significant performance variations."
