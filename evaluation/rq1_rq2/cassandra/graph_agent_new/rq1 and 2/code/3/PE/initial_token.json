    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'initial_token' configuration option is performance-sensitive. This is because the code context shows that the 'initial_token' configuration directly affects the token generation process, which is a time-expensive operation. The presence of 'if initialTokens.size() > 0' condition and the subsequent token generation logic based on 'initialTokens' indicate that this configuration can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Additionally, the code mentions warnings and exceptions related to token allocation, emphasizing the importance of this configuration for system performance."
