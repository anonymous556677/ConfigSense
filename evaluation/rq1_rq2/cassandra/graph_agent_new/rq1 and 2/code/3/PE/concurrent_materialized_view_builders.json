    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'concurrent_materialized_view_builders' is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the configuration directly affects the number of concurrent view builders, which can have a significant impact on system performance. The code context shows that this configuration is used to set the number of concurrent view builders, which can impact the execution time and memory consumption of compaction tasks related to materialized views. Therefore, changes in this configuration can lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
