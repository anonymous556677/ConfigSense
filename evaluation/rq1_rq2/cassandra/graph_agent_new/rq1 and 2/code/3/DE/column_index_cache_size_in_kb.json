This means that only partition information is held on heap and the index entries are read from disk.  Note that this size refers to the size of the serialized index information and not the size of the partition.",
    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The configuration 'column_index_cache_size_in_kb' is used to determine the size limit for sstable indexed key cache entries. Entries exceeding this size will not be held on heap, meaning only partition information is held on heap and index entries are read from disk.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The configuration is triggered whenever the system needs to access indexed key cache entries and checks if the size exceeds the limit set by 'column_index_cache_size_in_kb'. The frequency of triggering depends on the workload and data access patterns of the system.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the 'column_index_cache_size_in_kb' configuration option is that it affects the memory usage of the system. Setting a higher value may increase memory usage but improve performance by keeping more index entries in memory, while setting a lower value may reduce memory usage but may result in more disk reads for index entries."
