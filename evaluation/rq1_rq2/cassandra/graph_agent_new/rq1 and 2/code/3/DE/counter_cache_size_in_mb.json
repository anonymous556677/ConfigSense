    "config_description": "Maximum size of the counter cache in memory.  Counter cache helps to reduce counter locks' contention for hot counter cells. In case of RF = 1 a counter cache hit will cause Cassandra to skip the read before write entirely. With RF > 1 a counter cache hit will still help to reduce the duration of the lock hold, helping with hot counter cell updates, but will not allow skipping the read entirely. Only the local (clock, count) tuple of a counter cell is kept in memory, not the whole counter, so it's relatively cheap.  NOTE: if you reduce the size, you may not get you hottest keys loaded on startup.  Default value is empty to make it \"auto\" (min(2.5% of Heap (in MB), 50MB)). Set to 0 to disable counter cache. NOTE: if you perform counter deletes and rely on low gcgs, you should disable the counter cache.",
    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The 'counter_cache_size_in_mb' configuration determines the maximum size of the counter cache in memory. It is used to reduce counter locks' contention for hot counter cells. The configuration is used to initialize the counter cache with a specific capacity in megabytes and schedule periodic cache saves.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The 'counter_cache_size_in_mb' configuration is triggered whenever the counter cache is initialized and when cache saves are scheduled. The frequency of triggering depends on the values set for 'counter_cache_size_in_mb' and 'counter_cache_save_period'.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the 'counter_cache_size_in_mb' configuration option on the system is significant. Setting a higher value for the configuration can improve performance by reducing contention for hot counter cells and potentially skipping read operations. However, setting a lower value may result in not loading the hottest keys on startup. Additionally, setting the configuration to 0 disables the counter cache, which may impact performance negatively if counter deletes are performed and low gcgs are relied upon."
