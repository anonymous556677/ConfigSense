If space gets above this value, Cassandra will throw WriteTimeoutException on Mutations including tables with CDC enabled.

    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The triggering frequency of the 'cdc_total_space_in_mb' configuration is dependent on the usage of change-data-capture logs and the rate at which the logs are generated. If the space allocated for CDC logs exceeds the specified value, Cassandra will throw WriteTimeoutException on Mutations including tables with CDC enabled.",

If the space allocated for CDC logs exceeds the specified value, it can lead to performance issues such as WriteTimeoutException on Mutations. It is crucial to monitor and adjust this configuration to ensure smooth operation of the system."
