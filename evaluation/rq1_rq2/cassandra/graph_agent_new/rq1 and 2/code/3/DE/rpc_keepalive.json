    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The rpc_keepalive configuration in the code is used to enable or disable keepalive on rpc/native connections. It is set in the Server constructor by calling DatabaseDescriptor.getRpcKeepAlive() to determine the value.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The triggering frequency of the rpc_keepalive configuration in the system depends on when the Server constructor is called to create a new Server instance. This could happen when the application starts up or when a new connection is established.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the rpc_keepalive configuration option on the system is related to the performance and resource usage of the connections. Enabling keepalive can help maintain connections and reduce connection setup overhead, but it may also consume additional resources."
