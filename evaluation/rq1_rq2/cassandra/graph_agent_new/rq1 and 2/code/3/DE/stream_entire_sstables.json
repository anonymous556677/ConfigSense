This speeds up the network transfer significantly subject to throttling specified by stream_throughput_outbound_megabits_per_sec. Enabling this will reduce the GC pressure on sending and receiving node. When unset, the default is enabled. While this feature tries to keep the disks balanced, it cannot guarantee it. This feature will be automatically disabled if internode encryption is enabled.",
    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The configuration 'stream_entire_sstables' is used in the code to determine whether Cassandra should zero-copy stream entire eligible SSTables between nodes. It checks if full sstable transfers are enabled and if legacy counter shards are present before deciding whether to stream the SSTables.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The configuration 'stream_entire_sstables' is triggered whenever the method computeShouldStreamEntireSSTables() is called in the code. The frequency of this triggering depends on the specific operations and conditions in the system that require streaming entire SSTables.",

This reduces GC pressure on sending and receiving nodes. However, it may not guarantee disk balance and will be automatically disabled if internode encryption is enabled."
