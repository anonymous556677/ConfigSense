If disabled, replicas will assume that requests were forwarded to them instantly by the coordinator, which means that under overload conditions we will waste that much extra time processing already-timed-out requests.  Warning: It is generally assumed that users have setup NTP on their clusters, and that clocks are modestly in sync, since this is a requirement for general correctness of last write wins.",

If the configuration is enabled (DatabaseDescriptor.hasCrossNodeTimeout() returns true) and the createdAtNanos is less than or equal to the currentTimeNanos, the createdAtNanos is updated to currentTimeNanos. The function then calculates and returns the expiration time in nanoseconds.",

If the configuration is disabled, replicas may incorrectly assume that requests were forwarded instantly, leading to wasted processing time on already-timed-out requests under overload conditions. It is important for users to have NTP setup on their clusters and ensure clock synchronization for the general correctness of last write wins."
