Enable this option to be able to use UDFs with \"language javascript\" or any custom JSR-223 provider. This option has no effect, if enable_user_defined_functions is false.",
    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The configuration 'enable_scripted_user_defined_functions' is used in the code to check if scripted user-defined functions are enabled in the cassandra.yaml file. If the option is not enabled, an InvalidRequestException is thrown with a message prompting the user to set 'enable_scripted_user_defined_functions=true' in the cassandra.yaml file.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The triggering frequency of the 'enable_scripted_user_defined_functions' configuration depends on when the assertUdfsEnabled method is called in the code. This would typically happen when a user-defined function is being used in a query with the 'language' parameter not being 'java'.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "Enabling the 'enable_scripted_user_defined_functions' configuration allows the use of scripted user-defined functions (JavaScript UDFs) in addition to Java UDFs. This can provide more flexibility in writing custom functions for queries. However, it is important to be aware of the security risks associated with scripted UDFs, as mentioned in the InvalidRequestException message. Enabling this option may increase the complexity and potential security vulnerabilities of the system."
