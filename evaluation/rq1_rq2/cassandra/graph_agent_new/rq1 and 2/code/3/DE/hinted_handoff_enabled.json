    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The configuration 'hinted_handoff_enabled' is used to determine whether hinted handoff is enabled globally in the system. The method getHintedHandoffEnabled() returns the value of DatabaseDescriptor.hintedHandoffEnabled() which indicates if hinted handoff is enabled or not.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The configuration is triggered whenever the shouldHint() method is called, which is typically triggered when determining if a hint should be sent to a replica. The frequency of triggering depends on the number of replicas and the frequency of write operations in the system.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "Enabling or disabling hinted handoff can impact the system's performance and fault tolerance. If hinted handoff is disabled, hints will not be sent to replicas which may lead to data loss in case of node failures. On the other hand, enabling hinted handoff can increase the load on the system as hints need to be stored and processed for potential delivery to replicas."
