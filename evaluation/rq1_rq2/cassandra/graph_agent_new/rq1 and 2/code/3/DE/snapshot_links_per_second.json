This configuration setting is used to throttle the number of links created or removed during the snapshot process to avoid performance impact, especially on consumer grade SSDs. The unclear code determines the value to use for throttling based on the configuration setting."

A non-zero value here can be used to throttle these links to avoid negative performance impact of taking and clearing snapshots",
    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The configuration 'snapshot_links_per_second' is used to throttle the creation or clearing of snapshot links to avoid negative performance impact on consumer grade SSDs. The 'getSnapshotRateLimiter' method returns a RateLimiter object created with the value obtained from 'getSnapshotLinksPerSecond' method, which in turn retrieves the value from 'DatabaseDescriptor.getSnapshotLinksPerSecond'. This RateLimiter can be used to control the rate at which snapshot links are processed.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The triggering frequency of the 'snapshot_links_per_second' configuration depends on the rate at which snapshot links are created or cleared in the system. If the system frequently creates or clears snapshot links, this configuration will be triggered more often.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the 'snapshot_links_per_second' configuration on the system is significant, especially on consumer grade SSDs. Setting a non-zero value for this configuration can throttle the creation or clearing of snapshot links, which helps in avoiding negative performance impact. This can improve the overall system performance by preventing excessive load on the SSDs."
