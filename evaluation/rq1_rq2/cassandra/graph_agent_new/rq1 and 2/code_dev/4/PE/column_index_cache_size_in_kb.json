    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'column_index_cache_size_in_kb' configuration is performance-sensitive. This is because it directly impacts the memory usage of the system, which can lead to increased disk reads for index entries if set too low, impacting performance. Additionally, the configuration involves determining the size limit for sstable indexed key cache entries, which are time-expensive operations that can lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
