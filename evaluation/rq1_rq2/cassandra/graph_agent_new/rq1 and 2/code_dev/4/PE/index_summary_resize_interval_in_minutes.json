    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'index_summary_resize_interval_in_minutes' is considered performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly impacts the memory distribution in the system by redistributing memory from the fixed-size pool to sstables based on their read rates. The resampling process triggered by this configuration involves time-expensive operations that significantly affect system performance at the system level. Therefore, any changes to this configuration can lead to notable performance variations in the system."
