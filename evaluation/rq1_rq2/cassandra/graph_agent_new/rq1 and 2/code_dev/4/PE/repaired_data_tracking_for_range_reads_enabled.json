    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'repaired_data_tracking_for_range_reads_enabled' is performance-sensitive. The code context shows that enabling this configuration adds overhead to range read operations by tracking repaired data for all range reads. This can impact system performance, especially in scenarios where there are frequent range read operations with multiple full replicas. The configuration directly affects system performance by introducing additional time-expensive and memory-expensive operations within the code related to range reads, leading to notable performance variations at the system level."
