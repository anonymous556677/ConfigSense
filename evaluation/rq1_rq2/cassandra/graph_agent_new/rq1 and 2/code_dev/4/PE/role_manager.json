    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts system performance by handling authentication, authorization, role management, and permission validation. The code involves database operations for managing roles and permissions, which can be time-expensive and memory-expensive. These operations can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, making the configuration performance-sensitive."
