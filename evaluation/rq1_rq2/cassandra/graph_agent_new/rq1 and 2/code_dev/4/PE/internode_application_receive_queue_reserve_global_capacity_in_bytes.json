    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'internode_application_receive_queue_reserve_global_capacity_in_bytes' is classified as performance-sensitive. This is because it directly impacts the system's performance by setting a global limit on the size of messages queued for delivery and processing between nodes in the cluster. The code context provided does not show the direct impact of this configuration, but based on the developer's explanation, it is clear that setting a higher value for this configuration can lead to higher memory usage and potential performance issues if the system is not able to efficiently process the queued messages. Therefore, the configuration involves performance-related operations that are memory-expensive and can lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
