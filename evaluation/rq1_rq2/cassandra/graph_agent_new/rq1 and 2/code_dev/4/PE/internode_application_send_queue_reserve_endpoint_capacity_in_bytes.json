    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'internode_application_send_queue_reserve_endpoint_capacity_in_bytes' is performance-sensitive. This is because it directly impacts the system's performance by setting the per-endpoint capacity for messages queued for delivery to other nodes. Limiting the amount of queued messages per endpoint helps manage the on-wire size of messages being sent or received, which can have a notable impact on system performance. Additionally, the code context shows that the configuration involves performance-related operations that set the capacity values based on provided or default values, which can lead to significant performance variations at the system level."
