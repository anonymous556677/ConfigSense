    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'windows_timer_interval' is performance-sensitive. This is because it directly affects system performance by adjusting the system timer on Windows from the default 15ms down to the minimum of 1ms. This adjustment impacts timer intervals, thread scheduling, driver interrupts, etc., which are time-expensive operations. The configuration is used in critical methods like 'activate' and 'runMayThrow' that are triggered during system startup and shutdown, leading to notable performance variations at the system level. Lowering the Windows timer interval can significantly impact system latency and throughput, making it a performance-sensitive configuration."
