    "Reason": "The 'incremental_backups' configuration does not involve any performance-intensive operations that significantly impact system performance. The code snippet provided simply checks if incremental backups are enabled and creates hard links to sstables, which is a relatively lightweight operation. This configuration does not directly and substantially affect system performance at the system level, and the memory or time consumption is not notable enough to be considered performance-sensitive."
