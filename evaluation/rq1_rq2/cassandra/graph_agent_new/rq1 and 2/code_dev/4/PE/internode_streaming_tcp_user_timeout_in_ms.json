    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'internode_streaming_tcp_user_timeout_in_ms' is performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly affects the handling of incoming stream messages at the system level. The code snippet related to this configuration involves time-expensive operations such as measuring processing time, comparing it with the configured timeout, and generating a warning log if the processing time exceeds the timeout. These operations can have a notable impact on system performance, especially in scenarios where a large number of incoming stream messages are being processed. Therefore, the configuration is considered performance-sensitive due to its direct and substantial impact on system performance."
