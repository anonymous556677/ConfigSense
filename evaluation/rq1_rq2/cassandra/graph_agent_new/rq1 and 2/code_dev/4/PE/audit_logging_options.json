    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'audit_logging_options' configuration is performance-sensitive. The configuration directly affects system performance by enabling or disabling audit logging, which involves logging every incoming CQL command request and authentication. This logging process can be time-expensive and memory-expensive, especially when dealing with a high volume of requests. The code snippets related to enabling audit logging and creating the BinAuditLogger involve operations that contribute to execution time and memory consumption. Therefore, the configuration can lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
