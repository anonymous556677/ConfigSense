    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'cached_rows_fail_threshold' is performance-sensitive. This is because it directly impacts the resolution process with replica filtering protection, which involves time-expensive operations such as short-read protection, merging potentially out-of-date rows, and completing rows by querying silent replicas. The threshold set by 'cached_rows_fail_threshold' determines when the protection mechanism is triggered, affecting the number of valid row results produced and potentially impacting query performance at the system level. Therefore, the configuration involves performance-related operations that lead to notable performance variations, making it performance-sensitive."
