    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'num_tokens' configuration is performance-sensitive. This is because the number of tokens assigned to a node directly impacts data distribution and load balancing across the cluster, which can significantly affect system performance. The code related to 'num_tokens' involves operations that determine the token allocation algorithm, generate suitable tokens, and validate replication factors, all of which are time-expensive and memory-expensive operations. Changes in the 'num_tokens' configuration can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, making it a performance-sensitive configuration."
