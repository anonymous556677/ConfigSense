    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'network_authorizer' configuration is performance-sensitive. This is because it directly impacts user access control within the system, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The configuration involves operations that are time-expensive and memory-expensive, such as checking user permissions based on data center access. Additionally, the configuration interacts with the 'INetworkAuthorizer' interface and performs operations that can significantly affect system performance, making it a performance-sensitive configuration."
