    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'dynamic_snitch_badness_threshold' configuration is performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly affects how the dynamic snitch prioritizes replicas based on their performance, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The code context shows that the configuration is used to control how much worse a pinned host has to be before the dynamic snitch will prefer other replicas over it. This logic involves time-expensive operations such as updating scores and applying configuration changes, which can impact system performance significantly. Therefore, the configuration is considered performance-sensitive."
