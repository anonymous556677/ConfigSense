{
    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'internode_socket_send_buffer_size_in_bytes' is classified as performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the size of the socket buffer directly impacts the efficiency and performance of internode communication at the system level. The code context shows that this configuration involves performance-related operations related to socket buffer size allocation, which can have a notable impact on system performance. Therefore, any changes to this configuration can lead to significant performance variations, making it performance-sensitive."
