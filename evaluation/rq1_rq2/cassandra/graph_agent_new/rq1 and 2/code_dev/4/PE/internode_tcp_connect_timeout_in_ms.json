    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The 'internode_tcp_connect_timeout_in_ms' configuration does not appear to be performance-sensitive based on the provided code context and developer information. The configuration is used to determine the amount of time to wait for internode tcp connections to establish, and the code snippets provided do not contain any performance-intensive operations that would lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The configuration simply retrieves a timeout value from DatabaseDescriptor, which is a straightforward operation without significant performance impact."
