    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'index_summary_capacity_in_mb' is performance-sensitive. This is because it directly impacts the memory usage of index summaries, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The code snippet provided shows that the configuration is used to set the memory pool size in MB for SSTable index summaries, which can have a significant impact on memory consumption. Additionally, the developer's explanation highlights that exceeding the configured limit may result in memory usage adjustments by SSTables, further emphasizing the performance sensitivity of this configuration."
