    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The 'server_encryption_options' configuration is not performance-sensitive. The code related to this configuration primarily focuses on setting up encryption for server-to-server internode communication. While encryption can introduce some overhead, the primary goal of this configuration is to ensure data security rather than optimize performance. The code does not contain any performance-sensitive operations that significantly impact system performance at the system level. Therefore, the configuration is not classified as performance-sensitive."
