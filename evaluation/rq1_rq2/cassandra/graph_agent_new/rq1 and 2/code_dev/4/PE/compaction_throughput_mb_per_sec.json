{
    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'compaction_throughput_mb_per_sec' is performance-sensitive because it directly affects the rate at which compaction is performed in the system. The code context shows that this configuration is used to set a rate limit for compaction, which can have a significant impact on system performance. By controlling the throughput of compaction, this configuration can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, making it crucial for system optimization. Additionally, the developer's explanation highlights the importance of setting the 'compaction_throughput_mb_per_sec' at an optimal value to avoid performance issues, further emphasizing its performance sensitivity."
