    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'cross_node_timeout' configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts system performance by ensuring accurate measurement of request timeouts between nodes. The code snippet provided shows that the configuration is checked before calculating the expiration time, indicating that it plays a crucial role in the timing of operations. Additionally, the developer's explanation highlights the importance of this configuration in preventing wasted time processing already-timed-out requests, especially under overload conditions. Therefore, the 'cross_node_timeout' configuration involves time-sensitive operations that significantly affect system performance, making it performance-sensitive."
