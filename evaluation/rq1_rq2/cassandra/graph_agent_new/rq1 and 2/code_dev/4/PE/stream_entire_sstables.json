    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'stream_entire_sstables' configuration is performance-sensitive. This is because enabling this configuration directly impacts system performance by allowing Cassandra to zero-copy stream entire eligible SSTables between nodes, which can significantly speed up network transfer and reduce GC pressure. The code context also involves checking DatabaseDescriptor.streamEntireSSTables() and SSTable metadata conditions, which are time-expensive operations. Therefore, the configuration involves performance-related operations that lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
