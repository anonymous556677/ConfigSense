    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'enable_sasi_indexes' configuration option is performance-sensitive because it directly affects the system performance at the system level. Enabling SASI indexes through this configuration can introduce instability and performance issues in the Cassandra system. The code snippet provided checks if SASI indexes are enabled and throws an InvalidRequestException if they are not enabled in the cassandra.yaml configuration file. This indicates that enabling SASI indexes has a notable performance impact on the system, as it affects the creation and updating of indexes in the Cassandra schema, which are time-expensive operations. Therefore, the configuration is considered performance-sensitive due to its direct and substantial impact on system performance."
