    "Reason": "The configuration 'enable_scripted_user_defined_functions' does not involve any performance-related operations that are time-extensive or memory-extensive within its related code. The code snippet provided only checks if the configuration is enabled and throws an exception if it is not. This check does not directly and substantially affect system performance at the system level, therefore it is not considered performance-sensitive."
