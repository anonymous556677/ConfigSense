    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'allocate_tokens_for_keyspace' configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the token allocation algorithm, which in turn affects the distribution of data across the cluster. The code context shows that this configuration involves time-expensive operations such as generating suitable tokens based on the allocationKeyspace or choosing num_tokens at random. These operations can have a notable performance variation at the system level, making the configuration performance-sensitive."
