    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'internode_application_send_queue_capacity_in_bytes' is performance-sensitive. This is because it directly impacts the system performance by setting limits on the messages queued for delivery to other nodes and waiting to be processed on arrival. This can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, especially when the size of messages exceeds the specified capacity. The code context also involves a method that retrieves the value of the application send queue capacity, which can contribute to execution time and memory consumption. Therefore, the configuration involves performance-related operations that are time-extensive and memory-extensive, making it performance-sensitive."
