{
    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'cdc_free_space_check_interval_ms' is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the configuration directly impacts the system performance by determining the interval at which the system checks for available space in cdc_raw. This check is crucial for managing space usage efficiently and preventing potential issues related to space constraints. The configuration involves performance-related operations such as periodic space checks, which are time-expensive and memory-expensive, leading to notable performance variations at the system level."
