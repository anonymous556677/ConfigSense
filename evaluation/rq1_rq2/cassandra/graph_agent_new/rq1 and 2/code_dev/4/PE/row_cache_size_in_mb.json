    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'row_cache_size_in_mb' configuration is performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly impacts the system's performance by setting the maximum size of the row cache in memory. The code snippets provided show that the configuration value is used to determine the capacity of the cache builder and create the cache with the specified size. Setting a larger value for this configuration can lead to increased memory consumption, potentially causing notable performance variations at the system level. Therefore, the configuration involves performance-related operations that are memory-expensive and have a direct impact on system performance."
