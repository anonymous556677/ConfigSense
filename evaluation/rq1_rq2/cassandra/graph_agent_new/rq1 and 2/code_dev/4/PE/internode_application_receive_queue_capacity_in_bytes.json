    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'internode_application_receive_queue_capacity_in_bytes' is performance-sensitive because it directly affects the system's performance at the system level. The code context reveals that this configuration sets limits on messages queued for delivery to other nodes and waiting to be processed on arrival. These limits impact the memory consumption and processing efficiency of internode communication, making it a critical factor in system performance. Additionally, the configuration involves performance-related operations such as setting socket buffer sizes and application queue capacities, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
