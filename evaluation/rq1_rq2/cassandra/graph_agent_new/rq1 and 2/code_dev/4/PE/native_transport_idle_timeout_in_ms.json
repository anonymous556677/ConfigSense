    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'native_transport_idle_timeout_in_ms' configuration is performance-sensitive. The configuration directly affects system performance by managing idle client connections, which can impact resource utilization and system efficiency. The code snippet provided adds an IdleStateHandler to the channel pipeline with the specified idle timeout value, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Closing idle connections helps in freeing up resources and improving system performance, but setting the idle timeout value too low may prematurely close active connections, affecting system performance negatively."
