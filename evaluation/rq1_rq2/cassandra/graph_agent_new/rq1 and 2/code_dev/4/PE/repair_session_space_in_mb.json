    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'repair_session_space_in_mb' configuration is performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly affects the memory usage for Merkle tree calculations during repair operations, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The code snippet shows that the configuration is used to calculate the available bytes for the repair session space based on the configured value and replication factor. The calculation of available bytes directly impacts the memory allocation for creating Merkle trees, which are memory-expensive operations. Therefore, any changes in the 'repair_session_space_in_mb' configuration can have a significant impact on system performance by affecting memory usage during repair sessions."
