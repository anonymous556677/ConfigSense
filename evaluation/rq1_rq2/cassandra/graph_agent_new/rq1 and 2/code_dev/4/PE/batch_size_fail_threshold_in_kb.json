    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'batch_size_fail_threshold_in_kb' is not performance-sensitive based on the provided code context and developer information. The configuration simply returns a value set in DatabaseDescriptor, which does not involve any time-expensive or memory-expensive operations. It does not directly and substantially affect system performance at the system level, as it only determines a threshold for batch failure without causing notable performance variations."
