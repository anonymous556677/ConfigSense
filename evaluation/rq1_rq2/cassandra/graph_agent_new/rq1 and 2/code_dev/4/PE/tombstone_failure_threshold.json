{
    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'tombstone_failure_threshold' configuration is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the configuration directly affects the system's behavior in handling tombstone failures. By setting this threshold, the system can control how many tombstones are considered acceptable before triggering a failure. This configuration impacts the system's performance and data consistency by influencing the handling of tombstones, which are critical for maintaining data integrity. The code context shows that this configuration is used to retrieve the tombstone failure threshold value, indicating its significance in determining system behavior related to tombstones."
