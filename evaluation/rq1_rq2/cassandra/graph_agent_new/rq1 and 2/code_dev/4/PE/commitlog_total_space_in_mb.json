    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'commitlog_total_space_in_mb' configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly affects the system's performance at the system level. The unusedCapacity() method involves performance-related operations that are time-expensive, such as calculating the total commit log space and current size. If the total commit log space specified in the configuration is too small, it can lead to more frequent flush activities, impacting the system's performance and resource utilization. Therefore, this configuration can cause notable performance variations and should be considered performance-sensitive."
