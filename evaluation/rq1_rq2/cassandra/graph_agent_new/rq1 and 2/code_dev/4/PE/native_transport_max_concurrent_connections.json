    "classification_result": "Performance-insensitive with 100% confidence",
    "Reason": "The configuration option of maximum number of concurrent client connections is performance-insensitive because it only sets a limit on the number of connections and does not directly impact system performance. Different client connections do not affect the system performance as long as the system can handle the load."
