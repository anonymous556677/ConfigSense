    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'commit_failure_policy' configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts system performance by determining the action to take when a commit error occurs. The handleCommitError method, which is triggered by the configuration, contains code snippets that can be time-expensive and memory-expensive, such as stopping transports or terminating threads based on the policy set. These operations can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, making the configuration performance-sensitive."
