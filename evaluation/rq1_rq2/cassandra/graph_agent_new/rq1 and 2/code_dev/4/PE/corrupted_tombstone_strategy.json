    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The 'corrupted_tombstone_strategy' configuration does not involve any performance-related operations that are time-extensive or memory-extensive within its related code. The configuration is primarily used for handling invalid tombstones during reads and compactions, which does not directly and substantially affect system performance at the system level. The code snippet provided focuses on checking the strategy set in the configuration and handling invalid tombstones accordingly, without any significant performance impact."
