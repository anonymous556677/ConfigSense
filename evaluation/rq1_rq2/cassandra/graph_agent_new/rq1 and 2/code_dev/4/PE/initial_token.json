{
    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The initial_token configuration is classified as performance-sensitive. This is because the code snippet related to the initial_token configuration involves operations that directly impact system performance, such as token allocation and selection. Manual token specification can significantly affect the distribution of data across nodes, leading to notable performance variations at the system level. Additionally, the code snippet includes checks for allocationKeyspace and allocationLocalRf, which further contribute to the performance sensitivity of this configuration."
