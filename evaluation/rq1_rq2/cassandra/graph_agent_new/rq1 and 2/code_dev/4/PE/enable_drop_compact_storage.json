    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'enable_drop_compact_storage' is classified as performance-sensitive. This is because the code context related to this configuration involves operations that directly impact the system performance at the system level. The 'DatabaseDescriptor.enableDropCompactStorage()' method is called to check if the configuration is enabled before allowing the execution of 'ALTER ... DROP COMPACT STORAGE' statements on tables. This operation can significantly affect the storage format and performance of the tables in the system, making it performance-sensitive."
