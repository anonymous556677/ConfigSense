    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'inter_dc_tcp_nodelay' is performance-sensitive because it directly affects system performance at the system level. The code context shows that the configuration involves performance-related operations such as checking the tcpNoDelay flag, determining if communication is within the local data center, and fetching the value from DatabaseDescriptor. These operations can have notable performance variations, especially in terms of network latency and overhead from the TCP protocol. Enabling or disabling tcp_nodelay for inter-dc communication can significantly impact the system's performance, making this configuration performance-sensitive."
