{
    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'key_cache_size_in_mb' configuration is performance-sensitive. This is because the size of the key cache directly impacts the memory consumption of the system, which can have a significant effect on performance. In the provided code context, the initialization of the key cache with the specified capacity in MBs and the calculation of the memory capacity based on this configuration clearly show that the size of the key cache is crucial for the system's performance. Additionally, the developer's understanding that setting a larger value for the key cache size can improve performance further supports the classification of this configuration as performance-sensitive."
