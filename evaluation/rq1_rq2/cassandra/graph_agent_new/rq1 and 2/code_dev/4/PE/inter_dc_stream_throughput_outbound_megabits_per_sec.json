    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'inter_dc_stream_throughput_outbound_megabits_per_sec' is classified as performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly affects the throttling of all streaming file transfer between datacenters, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The code context provided includes methods that involve time-expensive operations, such as updating the inter DC throughput and calculating the rate in bytes based on the configured value. These operations can have a significant impact on system performance, making the configuration performance-sensitive."
