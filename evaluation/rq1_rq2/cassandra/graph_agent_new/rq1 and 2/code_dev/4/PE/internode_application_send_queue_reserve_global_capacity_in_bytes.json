    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'internode_application_send_queue_reserve_global_capacity_in_bytes' is performance-sensitive. This is because it directly impacts the maximum number of messages that can be queued for delivery between nodes in the cluster, leading to potential performance degradation if the specified capacity limits are exceeded. The code context provided also suggests that this configuration involves monitoring and scheduling tasks, which can contribute to time-expensive operations. Overall, the configuration involves performance-related operations that are time-extensive and memory-expensive, resulting in notable performance variations at the system level."
