    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'max_concurrent_automatic_sstable_upgrades' is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the system's performance by controlling the maximum number of concurrent sstable upgrades that can be automatically triggered. The code snippet provided shows that this configuration is checked in the 'maybeRunUpgradeTask' method, and if the conditions are met, an upgrade task is executed. Limiting the number of concurrent upgrade tasks helps in managing system resources and preventing performance degradation due to too many simultaneous upgrades. Therefore, this configuration involves performance-related operations that are time-expensive and memory-expensive, leading to notable performance variations at the system level."
