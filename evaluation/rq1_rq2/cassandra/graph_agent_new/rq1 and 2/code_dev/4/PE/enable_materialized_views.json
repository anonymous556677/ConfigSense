    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'enable_materialized_views' configuration is performance-sensitive. This is because enabling materialized views directly impacts system performance by allowing the creation of materialized views, which introduce additional storage and maintenance overhead. The code snippet related to this configuration involves multiple validations and processing steps that contribute to execution time and memory consumption. Disabling materialized views can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, making it a performance-sensitive configuration."
