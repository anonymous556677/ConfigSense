    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'auto_snapshot' configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts system performance by determining whether a snapshot is taken before keyspace truncation or dropping of column families. This operation involves time-expensive and memory-expensive operations such as flushing memtables, snapshotting, discarding SSTables, and truncating indexes. These operations can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, especially when dealing with large amounts of data. Therefore, the configuration's setting can significantly affect system performance and resource utilization."
