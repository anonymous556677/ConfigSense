    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'cached_rows_warn_threshold' configuration is classified as performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly impacts the system performance by limiting the number of rows that can be materialized on-heap during index and filtering queries. The code context shows that this configuration is used to ensure correct results at the desired read consistency level by setting a threshold. Breaching this threshold triggers a warning, indicating potential issues with replica synchronization or query size. The configuration involves performance-related operations that are time-expensive and memory-expensive, leading to notable performance variations at the system level."
