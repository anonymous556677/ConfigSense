    "Reason": "The 'partitioner' configuration is not performance-sensitive because it is used for data distribution across nodes and does not directly impact time-expensive or memory-expensive operations. While changing the partitioner can have a significant impact on the system, it is not related to performance variations at the system level caused by time-expensive or memory-expensive operations."
