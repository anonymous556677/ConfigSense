    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'range_request_timeout_in_ms' is performance-sensitive. The code context shows that this configuration directly affects the timeout for range requests in the system. The 'getRangeRpcTimeout' method is called multiple times in the code, indicating that it plays a crucial role in determining how long the coordinator should wait for scans to complete. This timeout directly impacts the system performance by affecting the completion time of range requests, making it a performance-sensitive configuration."
