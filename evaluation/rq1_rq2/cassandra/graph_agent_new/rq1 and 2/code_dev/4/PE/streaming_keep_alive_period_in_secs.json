    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'streaming_keep_alive_period_in_secs' is performance-sensitive. This is because the value of this configuration directly impacts the frequency of keep-alive messages sent between nodes during streaming sessions, which can significantly affect the system's performance at the system level. The code context provided shows that the value of 'streaming_keep_alive_period_in_secs' is used to schedule keep-alive tasks for channels, and a shorter period may result in more frequent keep-alive messages and potentially increased network traffic, while a longer period may increase the risk of session timeouts and failures. Therefore, any changes to this configuration can lead to notable performance variations in the system."
