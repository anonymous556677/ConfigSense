    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'transparent_data_encryption_options' configuration is performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration involves encryption operations that are time-expensive and memory-expensive within the related code. The encryption process triggered by this configuration adds overhead to the write operations by encrypting data before writing it to disk. This can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, especially for write operations with large datasets. The configuration directly and substantially affects system performance by introducing additional processing steps for encryption, making it performance-sensitive."
