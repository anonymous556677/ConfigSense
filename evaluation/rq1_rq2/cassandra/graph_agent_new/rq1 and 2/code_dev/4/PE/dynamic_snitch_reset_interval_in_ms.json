    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'dynamic_snitch_reset_interval_in_ms' configuration is considered performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly affects the frequency at which all host scores are reset in the system, which can have a notable impact on the overall performance of the system. The code snippet provided shows that the configuration is used to schedule tasks that reset host scores at a specified interval, indicating that it involves time-expensive operations that contribute to significant performance variations at the system level."
