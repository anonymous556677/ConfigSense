    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'counter_write_request_timeout_in_ms' is classified as performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly affects the timeout duration for counter write operations, which are critical operations in the system. The code context provided shows that the configuration is used in multiple methods to retrieve the configured timeout value in milliseconds. The performance impact of this configuration is significant as it can lead to potential failures or delays in completing counter write operations if not set appropriately. Therefore, any changes to this configuration can have a notable impact on the overall system performance at the system level."
