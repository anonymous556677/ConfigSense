    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'cdc_total_space_in_mb' configuration is classified as performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly impacts system performance at the system level by determining the total space available for change-data-capture logs on disk. The code snippet provided shows that the configuration involves time-expensive operations like multiplication and conversion, which can have a notable performance impact. Additionally, the developer's explanation highlights the significant impact of this configuration on system operation, as exceeding the specified limit can lead to WriteTimeoutException and potential data loss. Therefore, the configuration is considered performance-sensitive due to its direct and substantial effect on system performance and the presence of time-expensive operations within its related code."
