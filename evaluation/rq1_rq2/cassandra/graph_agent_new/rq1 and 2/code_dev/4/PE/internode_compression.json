    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'internode_compression' configuration is performance-sensitive. This is because it directly impacts the network bandwidth usage and CPU utilization at the system level. The shouldCompressConnection method checks the internodeCompression setting in the DatabaseDescriptor and determines whether to compress the connection between nodes. Depending on the setting ('all' or 'dc'), it can significantly affect the amount of data transmitted over the network, leading to notable performance variations. Additionally, enabling compression can increase CPU usage for compression and decompression operations, further impacting system performance."
