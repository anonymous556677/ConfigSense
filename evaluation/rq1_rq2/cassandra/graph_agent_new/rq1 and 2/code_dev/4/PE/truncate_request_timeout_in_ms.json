    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'truncate_request_timeout_in_ms' is performance-sensitive. This is because the timeout value set by this configuration directly impacts the performance of truncate operations in the system. The code snippets related to this configuration involve time-expensive operations such as waiting for truncates to complete within a specified timeout. If the timeout value is too low, truncates may time out prematurely, affecting system performance. On the other hand, setting a higher timeout value may increase the time taken for truncates to complete, also impacting system performance. Therefore, the configuration directly and substantially affects system performance at the system level, making it performance-sensitive."
