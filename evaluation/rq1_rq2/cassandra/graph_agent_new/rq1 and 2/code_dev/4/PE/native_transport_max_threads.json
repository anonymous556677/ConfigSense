    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'native_transport_max_threads' configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly affects the system's performance at the system level. The code context shows that this configuration is used to set the maximum number of threads for handling requests in the native transport. The number of threads directly impacts the system's ability to handle concurrent requests efficiently. Setting this value too low can lead to request queuing and slower response times, while setting it too high can consume excessive system resources and potentially lead to resource contention. Therefore, any changes to this configuration can have a notable impact on system performance."
