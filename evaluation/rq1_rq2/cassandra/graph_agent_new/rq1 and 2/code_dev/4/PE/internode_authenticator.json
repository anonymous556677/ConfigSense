{
    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'internode_authenticator' configuration option is performance-sensitive. This classification is based on the fact that the 'internode_authenticator' directly affects the authentication and security of internode connections at the system level. The code context shows that the configuration involves setting up authentication backends for internode connections, which can have a notable impact on system performance. Additionally, the configuration-related code includes operations that validate and set up the authentication, authorizer, role manager, and network authorizer, all of which are time-expensive and memory-expensive operations. Any misconfiguration or incompatible options in 'internode_authenticator' can lead to security vulnerabilities or connection failures, making it a performance-sensitive configuration."
