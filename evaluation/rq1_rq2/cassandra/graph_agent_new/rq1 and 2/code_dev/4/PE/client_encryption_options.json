    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'client_encryption_options' configuration is performance-sensitive. The configuration involves setting up SSL contexts, creating SSL certificates, and handling SSL connections for clients and servers. These operations are time-expensive and memory-expensive, leading to notable performance variations at the system level. The configuration directly impacts system performance by managing encryption protocols and consuming resources, making it performance-sensitive."
