    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'file_cache_size_in_mb' configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the memory allocation for sstable chunk cache and buffer pooling in the system. The calculation of 'cacheSize' in the ChunkCache class is based on this configuration value, and it determines the amount of memory available for caching uncompressed sstable chunks. This configuration involves time-expensive and memory-expensive operations within the code, such as calculating the cache size and determining if the cache is enabled. Changes to this configuration can lead to notable performance variations at the system level by affecting the amount of data that can be cached in memory, ultimately influencing system performance."
