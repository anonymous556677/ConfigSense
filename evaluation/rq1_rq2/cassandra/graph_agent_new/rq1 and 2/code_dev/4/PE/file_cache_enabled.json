    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'file_cache_enabled' configuration option is performance-sensitive. This is because enabling the cache directly affects system performance by storing recently accessed sections of the sstable in-memory as uncompressed buffers, which can improve read performance but will consume memory resources. The code context also shows that the configuration involves performance-related operations such as creating the cache, loading buffers, and handling cache invalidation, which are time-expensive and memory-expensive operations. Additionally, the configuration directly impacts the system level by determining whether the cache should be created based on the flag value and cache size, leading to notable performance variations."
