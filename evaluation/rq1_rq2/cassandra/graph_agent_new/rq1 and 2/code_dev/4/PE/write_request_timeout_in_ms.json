{
    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'write_request_timeout_in_ms' is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the 'write_request_timeout_in_ms' directly affects the timeout duration for write operations in the system. Setting a lower value can lead to quicker timeouts for write operations, impacting the overall performance and reliability of the system. The code context shows that this configuration is used in various methods to set the timeout for write operations, which are critical for system performance. Therefore, any notable variations in the 'write_request_timeout_in_ms' configuration can have a substantial impact on system performance at the system level."
