    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'native_transport_max_frame_size_in_mb' is performance-sensitive. This is because the maximum frame size directly impacts the system's ability to process incoming requests efficiently. Frames larger than the configured size are rejected, which can lead to performance degradation or even system failures. The code related to this configuration involves operations that handle the encoding and decoding of message envelopes, which are critical for communication between nodes. Therefore, any changes to the maximum frame size can have a significant impact on the overall performance of the system."
