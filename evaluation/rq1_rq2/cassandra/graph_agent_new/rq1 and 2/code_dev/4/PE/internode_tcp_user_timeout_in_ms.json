    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'internode_tcp_user_timeout_in_ms' is performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly affects the amount of time to wait for internode TCP connections to establish, which can have a significant impact on the overall system performance. The code context shows that this configuration is crucial for determining the timeout for internode TCP connections, which are essential for the system's stability and performance. Additionally, the triggering frequency of this configuration is tied to the creation of internode TCP connections, indicating that it plays a key role in system operations. Therefore, any changes or misconfigurations in this option can lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
