    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'counter_cache_size_in_mb' configuration is performance-sensitive. This is because the size of the counter cache directly impacts memory consumption and cache efficiency, which can have a notable performance variation at the system level. The code snippet provided shows that the configuration is used to initialize the counter cache with a specific capacity in megabytes, affecting the memory usage and cache operations. Additionally, setting a larger size for the counter cache can improve performance by reducing contention for hot counter cells, while a smaller size may result in performance degradation. Therefore, the 'counter_cache_size_in_mb' configuration involves performance-related operations that are memory-expensive and can lead to significant performance variations, making it performance-sensitive."
