    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'cas_contention_timeout_in_ms' is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the configuration directly impacts the retry behavior of CAS operations, which can significantly affect system performance. The code context shows that the configuration value is used as the timeout for retrying Paxos rounds during CAS operations. The timeout value set for this configuration can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, depending on the frequency of contention situations and the impact on the retry behavior of CAS operations. Therefore, any changes to this configuration can have a substantial impact on system performance, making it performance-sensitive."
