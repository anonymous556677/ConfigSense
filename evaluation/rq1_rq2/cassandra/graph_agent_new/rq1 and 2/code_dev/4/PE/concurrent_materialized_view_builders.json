    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'concurrent_materialized_view_builders' is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that this configuration directly controls the number of simultaneous materialized view builder tasks allowed in the system. Adjusting this value can have a significant impact on system performance by affecting the concurrency of view building operations. The code contains methods to get and set this configuration value, indicating its importance in managing system performance."
