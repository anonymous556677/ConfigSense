    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'dynamic_snitch_update_interval_in_ms' configuration is performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly impacts the frequency at which the dynamic snitch is updated in the system. The code context reveals that the configuration controls how often the more expensive part of host score calculation is performed, indicating that it involves time-expensive operations. Changing the update interval can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, affecting the computational load and potentially the accuracy of host scores. Therefore, the configuration is considered performance-sensitive based on its direct and substantial impact on system performance."
