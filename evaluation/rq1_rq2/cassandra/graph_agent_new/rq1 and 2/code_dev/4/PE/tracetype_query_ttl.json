    "Reason": "The configuration option 'tracetype_query_ttl' is not performance-sensitive. The code related to this configuration mainly deals with defining the TTL for different trace types during the logging of the repair process. The configuration itself does not involve any time-expensive or memory-expensive operations that would lead to notable performance variations at the system level. It simply retrieves the TTL value based on the ordinal value of the TraceType enum, which is a straightforward mapping operation without significant performance impact."
