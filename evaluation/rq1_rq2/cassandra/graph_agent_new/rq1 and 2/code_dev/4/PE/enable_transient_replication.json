    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The 'enable_transient_replication' configuration does not involve any performance-related operations that are time-expensive or memory-expensive within its related code. The configuration is mainly used to check if transient replication is enabled or not, and it does not directly and substantially affect system performance at the system level. Therefore, it is classified as not performance-sensitive."
