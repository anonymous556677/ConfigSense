    "Reason": "The 'enable_user_defined_functions' configuration does not involve any performance-related operations that are time-extensive or memory-extensive within its related code. The code snippet provided only checks if the configuration is set to true and throws an exception if it is not. This operation is not time-expensive or memory-expensive and does not lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Therefore, the configuration is not considered performance-sensitive."
