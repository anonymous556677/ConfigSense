    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'ideal_consistency_level' configuration option is performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly affects the performance of the system by tracking a metric per keyspace indicating whether replication achieved the ideal consistency level for writes without timing out. This tracking involves additional performance-related operations within the 'getWriteResponseHandler' method, such as constructing delegate response handlers and setting ideal consistency level response handlers. These operations contribute to notable performance variations at the system level, making the configuration performance-sensitive."
