    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option phiConvictThreshold is performance-sensitive. This is because it directly impacts the performance of the system by determining when a host is marked as failed, which can have significant implications on the system's reliability and performance. The code context shows that the phiConvictThreshold is used in the convict method to check if the phi value is greater than 2 times the phiConvictThreshold before marking a host as failed. This operation is time-expensive and memory-expensive as it involves calculations and comparisons that can significantly affect the system's performance at the system level."
