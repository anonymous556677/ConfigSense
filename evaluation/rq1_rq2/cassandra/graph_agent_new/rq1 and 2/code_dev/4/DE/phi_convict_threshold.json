    "config_description": "phi value that must be reached for a host to be marked down. most users should never need to adjust this.",
    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The phiConvictThreshold configuration is used in the code to determine the phi value that must be reached for a host to be marked down. It is used in the convict method to check if the phi value is greater than 2 times the phiConvictThreshold before marking a host as failed.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The triggering frequency of the phiConvictThreshold configuration depends on the failure detection mechanism and the frequency of phi calculations in the system. It is triggered whenever the phi value for a host is calculated and compared in the convict method.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the phiConvictThreshold configuration option is significant as it determines when a host is marked as failed in the system. Adjusting this value can affect the reliability and performance of the system's failure detection mechanism, so most users should not need to adjust this unless they have a specific reason to do so."
