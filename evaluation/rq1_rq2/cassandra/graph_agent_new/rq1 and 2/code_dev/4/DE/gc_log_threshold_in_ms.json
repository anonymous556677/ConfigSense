    "config_description": "GC Pauses greater than 200 ms will be logged at INFO level This threshold can be adjusted to minimize logging if necessary",
    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The configuration 'gc_log_threshold_in_ms' sets a threshold for logging GC pauses greater than the specified value (in milliseconds) at INFO level. This threshold can be adjusted to control the amount of logging for GC pauses.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The configuration is triggered whenever a GC pause occurs and its duration exceeds the specified threshold value. The frequency of triggering depends on the frequency and duration of GC pauses in the system.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the 'gc_log_threshold_in_ms' configuration option on the system is related to the amount of logging generated for GC pauses. Setting a higher threshold value may reduce the amount of logging and potentially improve system performance by reducing the overhead of logging GC pauses. However, setting a very high threshold value may result in important GC pause information being missed in the logs."
