    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The triggering frequency of the rpc_keepalive configuration in the system depends on when the Server constructor is called to create a new server instance. This could be during server startup or when a new connection is established.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "Enabling keepalive on rpc/native connections can have a positive impact on the system by reducing connection setup time and improving overall connection reliability. However, it may also increase resource usage due to maintaining idle connections."
