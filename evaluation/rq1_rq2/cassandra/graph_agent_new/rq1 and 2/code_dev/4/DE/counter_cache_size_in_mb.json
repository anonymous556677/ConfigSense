In case of RF = 1 a counter cache hit will cause Cassandra to skip the read before write entirely. With RF > 1 a counter cache hit will still help to reduce the duration of the lock hold, helping with hot counter cell updates, but will not allow skipping the read entirely. Only the local (clock, count) tuple of a counter cell is kept in memory, not the whole counter, so it's relatively cheap.  NOTE: if you reduce the size, you may not get you hottest keys loaded on startup.  Default value is empty to make it \"auto\" (min(2.5% of Heap (in MB), 50MB)). Set to 0 to disable counter cache. NOTE: if you perform counter deletes and rely on low gcgs, you should disable the counter cache.",
    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The 'counter_cache_size_in_mb' configuration determines the maximum size of the counter cache in memory. It is used to reduce counter locks' contention for hot counter cells. The configuration is read to initialize the counter cache with the specified capacity in megabytes. The cache is then scheduled for saving periodically based on the configured save period and keys to save.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The 'counter_cache_size_in_mb' configuration is triggered when the counter cache is initialized and when the cache is scheduled for saving based on the configured save period.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the 'counter_cache_size_in_mb' configuration option on the system is significant. Setting a larger size for the counter cache can help reduce contention for hot counter cells and improve performance by skipping read operations before writes. However, setting a smaller size may result in not loading the hottest keys on startup. It is recommended to set the size based on the available memory and workload requirements. Disabling the counter cache can be beneficial in scenarios where counter deletes are frequent and low gcgs are relied upon."
