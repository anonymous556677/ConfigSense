The method getCDCSpaceInMB() retrieves this configuration value, which is used in the allowableCDCBytes() method to calculate the allowable CDC bytes."

    "config_description": "Total space to use for change-data-capture logs on disk.  If space gets above this value, Cassandra will throw WriteTimeoutException on Mutations including tables with CDC enabled. A CDCCompactor is responsible for parsing the raw CDC logs and deleting them when parsing is completed.  The default value is the min of 4096 mb and 1/8th of the total space of the drive where cdc_raw_directory resides.",
    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The configuration code 'cdc_total_space_in_mb' is used to determine the total space available for change-data-capture logs on disk. It retrieves the value set for CDC space in MB from the DatabaseDescriptor and converts it to bytes by multiplying by 1024*1024.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The triggering frequency of the 'cdc_total_space_in_mb' configuration is dependent on the amount of change-data-capture logs being generated and stored on disk. The configuration is typically triggered when the space used for CDC logs approaches or exceeds the specified total space limit.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the 'cdc_total_space_in_mb' configuration option on the system is significant. If the space allocated for CDC logs reaches or exceeds the specified limit, Cassandra will throw WriteTimeoutException on Mutations for tables with CDC enabled. This can result in failed write operations and potential data loss. It is crucial to monitor and adjust this configuration to ensure sufficient space for CDC logs."
