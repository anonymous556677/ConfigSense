    "config_description": "Throttles all streaming file transfer between the datacenters, this setting allows users to throttle inter dc stream throughput in addition to throttling all network stream traffic as configured with stream_throughput_outbound_megabits_per_sec When unset, the default is 200 Mbps or 25 MB/s",
    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The configuration 'inter_dc_stream_throughput_outbound_megabits_per_sec' is used to throttle all streaming file transfer between the datacenters. The code provided includes methods to set and get the value of this configuration, as well as a method to calculate the rate in bytes based on the configured value.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The configuration is triggered whenever the 'setInterDCStreamThroughputMbPerSec' method is called to set a new value for the inter DC stream throughput. This can be triggered by user actions or system events that require adjusting the throttling of inter DC stream traffic.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the 'inter_dc_stream_throughput_outbound_megabits_per_sec' configuration option is significant as it directly affects the throttling of all streaming file transfer between datacenters. Setting a lower value can limit the throughput between datacenters, while setting a higher value can potentially increase the throughput but may also lead to network congestion or performance issues."
