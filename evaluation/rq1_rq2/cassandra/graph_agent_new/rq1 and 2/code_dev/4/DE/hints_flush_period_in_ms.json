    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The configuration 'hints_flush_period_in_ms' is used to determine how often hints should be flushed from the internal buffers to disk. It is set in milliseconds.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The configuration is triggered periodically by a ScheduledExecutorService.scheduleWithFixedDelay method, which schedules the execution of the flushBufferPool method in the writeExecutor at a fixed rate specified by the 'hints_flush_period_in_ms' value.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the 'hints_flush_period_in_ms' configuration option on the system is that it determines the frequency at which hints are flushed to disk. A shorter flush period may result in more frequent disk writes, potentially impacting system performance and disk I/O. On the other hand, a longer flush period may lead to delayed persistence of hints, which could affect data durability and consistency."
