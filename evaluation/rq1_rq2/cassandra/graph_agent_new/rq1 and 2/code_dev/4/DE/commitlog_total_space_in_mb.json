So a small total commitlog space will tend to cause more flush activity on less-active columnfamilies.  The default value is the smaller of 8192, and 1/4 of the total space of the commitlog volume. ",
    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The 'commitlog_total_space_in_mb' configuration determines the total space to use for commit logs on disk. The unusedCapacity() method calculates the unused capacity by subtracting the current size of the commit log from the total space specified in the configuration.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The configuration is triggered whenever the system needs to calculate the unused capacity of the commit log. This could happen when a new commit log segment is created or when a flush operation is triggered due to the commit log space reaching its limit.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the 'commitlog_total_space_in_mb' configuration option is significant as it directly affects the behavior of the system when the commit log space gets above the specified value. If the total commit log space is small, it can lead to more frequent flush activities on less-active column families, impacting the system's performance and resource utilization."
