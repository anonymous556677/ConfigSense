    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The configuration 'max_hints_file_size_in_mb' is used to set the maximum size for a single hints file in megabytes. In the provided code snippet, the value of 'maxHintsFileSize' is retrieved using 'DatabaseDescriptor.getMaxHintsFileSize()' and is used to determine when to break the loop while writing hints to a file.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The triggering frequency of the 'max_hints_file_size_in_mb' configuration depends on the size of the hints being written. Whenever the size of the hints being written exceeds the configured maximum size, the configuration is triggered to break the loop and start writing to a new hints file.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the 'max_hints_file_size_in_mb' configuration option on the system is that it helps in controlling the size of individual hints files. By setting a maximum size, it ensures that hints files do not grow too large, which can help in managing disk space usage and optimizing performance."
