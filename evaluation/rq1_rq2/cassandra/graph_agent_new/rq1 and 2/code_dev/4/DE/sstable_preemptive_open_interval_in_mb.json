This helps to smoothly transfer reads between the sstables, reducing page cache churn and keeping hot rows hot",
    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The configuration 'sstable_preemptive_open_interval_in_mb' is used to calculate the open interval for replacement sstables during compaction. The interval is calculated based on the value of the configuration multiplied by 1MB (1L << 20). If certain conditions are met, the interval is set to Long.MAX_VALUE.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The triggering frequency of the 'sstable_preemptive_open_interval_in_mb' configuration depends on the frequency of compaction operations in the system. The configuration is triggered whenever compaction occurs and replacement sstables need to be opened preemptively.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the 'sstable_preemptive_open_interval_in_mb' configuration on the system is that it helps to smoothly transfer reads between sstables during compaction, reducing page cache churn and keeping hot rows hot. By opening replacement sstables preemptively, it optimizes the compaction process and improves overall system performance."
