    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The configuration 'incremental_backups' is checked in the maybeIncrementallyBackup method to determine if incremental backups are enabled. If enabled, hard links to each sstable flushed or streamed locally are created in a backups/ subdirectory of the keyspace data.",
