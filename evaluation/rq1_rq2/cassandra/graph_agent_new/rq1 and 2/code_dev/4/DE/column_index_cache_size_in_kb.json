This means that only partition information is held on heap and the index entries are read from disk.  Note that this size refers to the size of the serialized index information and not the size of the partition.",
    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The configuration 'column_index_cache_size_in_kb' is used to determine the size limit for sstable indexed key cache entries. If the entries exceed this size, they will not be held in heap memory, meaning only partition information is held in memory and the index entries are read from disk.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The triggering frequency of the 'column_index_cache_size_in_kb' configuration depends on the size of the serialized index information. Whenever the size of the serialized index information exceeds the configured cache size, the configuration will be triggered.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the 'column_index_cache_size_in_kb' configuration option is that it affects the memory usage of the system. If the size limit is set too low, it may result in more disk reads for index entries, potentially impacting performance. On the other hand, setting it too high may lead to increased memory usage."
