    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'row_cache_size_in_mb' configuration is performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly impacts the memory usage of the row cache, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The code snippets provided show that the configuration value is used to set the capacity of the cache builder or cache creation, indicating that it involves memory-expensive operations. Additionally, the developer's understanding highlights the significant impact of this configuration on memory allocation and performance improvement, further supporting its classification as performance-sensitive."
