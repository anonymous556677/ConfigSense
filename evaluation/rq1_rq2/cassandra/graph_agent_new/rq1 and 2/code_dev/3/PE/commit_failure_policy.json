    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'commit_failure_policy' configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts system performance by determining the behavior when a commit error occurs. The code snippet related to this configuration includes operations that can be time-expensive, such as stopping transports or terminating threads based on the policy chosen. These operations can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, making the configuration performance-sensitive."
