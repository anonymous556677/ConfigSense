    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'concurrent_materialized_view_builders' configuration is performance-sensitive. This is because it directly controls the number of simultaneous materialized view builder tasks allowed in the system, impacting the system's performance at the task execution level. The configuration involves setting and retrieving the value using methods in the CompactionManager class, which directly affects the system's ability to handle concurrent view building tasks efficiently. Therefore, changes to this configuration can lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
