    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'internode_socket_send_buffer_size_in_bytes' is considered performance-sensitive. This is because the size of the socket buffer directly impacts the performance of internode communication by adjusting the buffer size. The code context shows that the configuration involves performance-related operations related to setting or retrieving the socket buffer size, which can be time-expensive or memory-expensive. Additionally, the developer's information indicates that the configuration is triggered whenever the socket buffer size for internode communication needs to be set or retrieved, further emphasizing its performance sensitivity at the system level."
