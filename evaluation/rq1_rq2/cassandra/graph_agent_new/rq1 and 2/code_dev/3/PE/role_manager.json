    "Reason": "The 'role_manager' configuration is not performance-sensitive. Although it plays a crucial role in managing grants and memberships between roles for authentication and authorization, the operations it performs are not time-expensive or memory-expensive. The code mainly focuses on checking permissions, validating options, and managing roles, which do not involve operations that cause notable performance variations at the system level."
