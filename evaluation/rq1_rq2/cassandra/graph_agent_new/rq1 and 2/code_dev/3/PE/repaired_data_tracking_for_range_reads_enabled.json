{
    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'repaired_data_tracking_for_range_reads_enabled' is performance-sensitive. The code context shows that this configuration directly impacts the performance of range read operations by enabling tracking of repaired data and comparison between replicas. This involves additional time-expensive and memory-expensive operations such as creating messages, sending callbacks, and resolving data. Enabling this configuration adds overhead to range read operations, potentially causing notable performance variations at the system level. Therefore, it meets the criteria of directly and substantially affecting system performance, making it performance-sensitive."
