    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'range_request_timeout_in_ms' configuration is performance-sensitive. The configuration directly affects the maximum amount of time the coordinator will wait for range requests to complete, which can have a significant impact on system performance. The code context provided shows that the configuration is used in determining timeouts for various RPC operations, including range scans. These operations can be time-expensive and directly impact system performance. Therefore, the configuration involving time-extensive operations and leading to notable performance variations at the system level is classified as performance-sensitive."
