    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The initial_token configuration is classified as performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly impacts the token assignment for nodes in the cluster, which can significantly affect the distribution and load balancing of data. The code context shows that the configuration involves operations that are time-expensive, such as generating tokens based on user input or allocationKeyspace. These operations can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, making the configuration performance-sensitive."
