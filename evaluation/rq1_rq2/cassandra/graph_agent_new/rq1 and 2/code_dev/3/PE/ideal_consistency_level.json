    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'ideal_consistency_level' is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the configuration directly impacts the performance of the system by adding additional tracking and handling for write responses to ensure replication achieves the ideal consistency level. This involves time-expensive operations such as setting up response handlers to track the ideal consistency level for each write operation, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
