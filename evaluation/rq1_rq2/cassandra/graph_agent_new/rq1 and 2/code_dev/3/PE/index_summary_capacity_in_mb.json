    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'index_summary_capacity_in_mb' is performance-sensitive. This is because it directly affects the memory usage and allocation for index summaries in SSTables, which can have a significant impact on system performance. The code snippet provided shows that the configuration is used to set the memory pool size for the index summary manager, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Additionally, the developer's explanation highlights that exceeding the configured memory limit can result in memory usage adjustments by SSTables, further emphasizing the performance sensitivity of this configuration."
