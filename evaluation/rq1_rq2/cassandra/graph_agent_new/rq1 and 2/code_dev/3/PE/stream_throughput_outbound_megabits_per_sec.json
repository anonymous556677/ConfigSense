    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'stream_throughput_outbound_megabits_per_sec' configuration is performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly affects the rate at which streaming file transfers occur between datacenters, which can have a significant impact on system performance. The code context also shows that the configuration involves performance-related operations such as updating throughput and calculating rates in bytes based on the configured throughput value, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
