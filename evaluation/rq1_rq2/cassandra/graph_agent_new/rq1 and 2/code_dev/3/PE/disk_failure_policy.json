    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The 'disk_failure_policy' configuration does not directly involve any performance-related operations that are time-extensive or memory-extensive within its related code. The configuration mainly determines the behavior of the system in response to disk failures or errors, such as shutting down transports, killing the JVM, or responding to specific error scenarios. While these actions may have an impact on system availability and behavior, they do not directly cause notable performance variations at the system level. Therefore, the configuration is not classified as performance-sensitive."
