    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'counter_write_request_timeout_in_ms' is performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly affects the waiting time for counter write operations to complete, which can have a significant impact on the system's performance. The code snippets related to this configuration involve fetching timeout values in different units and calculating the current timeout based on the write type. These operations are time-expensive and contribute to notable performance variations at the system level, making the configuration performance-sensitive."
