    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The 'internode_tcp_connect_timeout_in_ms' configuration is not performance-sensitive based on the provided code context and developer information. The code snippets provided do not contain any performance-intensive operations related to this configuration. The configuration is simply retrieving a timeout value for establishing internode tcp connections from the DatabaseDescriptor. While the timeout value may impact the connection establishment time, it does not directly involve any time-expensive or memory-expensive operations that would lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Therefore, the configuration is not considered performance-sensitive."
