    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'internode_streaming_tcp_user_timeout_in_ms' is performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly affects the maximum allowed processing time for incoming stream messages on a streaming connection. The code snippet provided shows that the configuration value is checked during the processing of incoming stream messages to determine if the processing time exceeds the specified timeout. If the processing time exceeds the timeout, a warning is logged and the streaming connection might be closed. This directly impacts system performance at the system level by potentially affecting the stability and reliability of streaming connections based on the timeout value set in the configuration."
