    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'flush_compression' configuration is performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly impacts the system performance during the flushing of SSTables, which can potentially block writes if a high ratio compressor is used. The code snippet provided shows that the configuration involves checking the compression type based on the operation type 'FLUSH' and selecting the appropriate compression parameters. This decision directly affects the execution time and memory consumption during flush operations, leading to notable performance variations at the system level."
