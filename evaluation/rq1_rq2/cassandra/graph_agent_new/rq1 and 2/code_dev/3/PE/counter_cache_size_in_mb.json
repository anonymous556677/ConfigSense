    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'counter_cache_size_in_mb' configuration is classified as performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly impacts the system performance by determining the maximum size of the counter cache in memory. The code snippet provided shows that the configuration is used to initialize the counter cache with a specified capacity in megabytes, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Setting a higher size can improve performance by reducing contention for hot counter cells, but it may consume more memory. Conversely, setting a lower size may result in not loading the hottest keys on startup, affecting system performance. Therefore, the 'counter_cache_size_in_mb' configuration involves performance-related operations that are memory-expensive and can have a significant impact on system performance."
