    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'slow_query_log_timeout_in_ms' is performance-sensitive. This is because the code context shows that this configuration directly affects the monitoring time of select queries and determines when slow queries are logged. The 'slow_query_log_timeout_in_ms' configuration involves time-expensive operations related to measuring query execution time and triggering slow query logging based on the specified timeout value. Any changes to this configuration can lead to notable performance variations at the system level by impacting the logging behavior of slow queries, which can have a significant effect on system performance."
