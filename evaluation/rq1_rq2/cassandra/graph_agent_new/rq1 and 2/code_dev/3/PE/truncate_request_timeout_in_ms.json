    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'truncate_request_timeout_in_ms' is performance-sensitive. This is because it directly affects the timeout for truncate operations in the system, which can have a significant impact on system performance. The code context shows that the configuration is used in various methods to calculate the timeout for truncates and handle TimeoutExceptions. Since truncates are time-expensive operations, any changes in the timeout configuration can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Therefore, the configuration is considered performance-sensitive."
