    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'native_transport_max_threads' configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the system's ability to handle concurrent requests by setting the maximum number of threads for request handling. The code context shows that this configuration is used to create the requestExecutor in the Dispatcher class, which is crucial for processing requests efficiently. Any changes to this configuration can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, affecting request processing speed and system resource utilization."
