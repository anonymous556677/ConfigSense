    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'compaction_throughput_mb_per_sec' is performance-sensitive because it directly affects the rate at which compaction operations are performed, which can have a significant impact on system performance. The code context shows that this configuration is used to set the rate limit for compaction operations, which are time-expensive and memory-expensive operations. By adjusting this configuration, the speed of compaction operations can be increased, leading to notable performance variations at the system level. Therefore, this configuration is considered performance-sensitive."
