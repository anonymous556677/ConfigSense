    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'internode_application_receive_queue_capacity_in_bytes' is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the amount of memory consumed by queued messages in the system. Setting this value too low may lead to message loss or delays in message processing, while setting it too high may lead to excessive memory consumption and potential performance degradation. The code context shows that this configuration sets limits on messages queued for delivery and processing, which are critical operations affecting system performance at the system level."
