    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'inter_dc_tcp_nodelay' is classified as performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly impacts system performance by affecting the network communication latency for cross-datacenter responses. The code context shows that the configuration involves checking for the tcpNoDelay flag and making decisions based on whether the communication is within the local data center or not. These decisions can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, as disabling tcp_nodelay for inter-dc communication can result in larger network packets being sent, reducing overhead from the TCP protocol but increasing latency. Therefore, the configuration involves performance-related operations that are time-extensive and memory-expensive, leading to significant performance impacts."
