    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'key_cache_size_in_mb' configuration is performance-sensitive. The code context shows that this configuration directly affects the size of the key cache in memory, which can have a significant impact on system performance. A larger key cache size can improve performance by reducing the number of seeks for key cache hits, but it can also consume more memory. The configuration involves memory-expensive operations, such as initializing the key cache with a specified capacity in MBs and creating an AutoSavingCache object to manage the key cache. These operations can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, making the configuration performance-sensitive."
