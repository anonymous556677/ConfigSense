    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'repair_session_space_in_mb' is performance-sensitive. This is because the value set for this configuration directly impacts the memory usage during repairs, specifically in the creation of Merkle trees for validation compaction. The code snippet shows that the available memory for Merkle tree calculations is determined based on this configuration value. A higher value can lead to more memory being allocated, potentially improving performance by reducing over-streaming but increasing memory usage. Conversely, a lower value can help in reducing memory usage but may lead to over-streaming data, impacting performance negatively. Therefore, the configuration directly and substantially affects system performance at the memory usage level, making it performance-sensitive."
