    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'enable_drop_compact_storage' is performance-sensitive. This is because the code related to this configuration involves operations that directly impact the system performance, such as checking if the configuration is enabled before allowing a 'DROP COMPACT STORAGE' operation. This operation can have significant implications on the storage efficiency and performance of the system. Additionally, the configuration is triggered when specific alterations to table storage format are attempted, indicating its importance in managing system performance."
