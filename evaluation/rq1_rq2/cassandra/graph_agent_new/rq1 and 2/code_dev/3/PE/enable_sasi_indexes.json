    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'enable_sasi_indexes' configuration option is performance-sensitive. This is because enabling SASI indexes through this configuration can directly impact system performance and resource utilization. The code snippet related to this configuration checks if SASI indexes are enabled and throws an exception if they are not, indicating the importance of this configuration for system functionality. Additionally, SASI indexes are experimental and not recommended for production, so enabling them can introduce instability and unexpected behavior, further emphasizing the performance sensitivity of this configuration."
