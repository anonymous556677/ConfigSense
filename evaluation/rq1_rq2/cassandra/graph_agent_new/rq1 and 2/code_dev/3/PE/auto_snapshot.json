    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The 'auto_snapshot' configuration option is not performance-sensitive. The code related to this configuration involves taking a snapshot before truncating or dropping data for data safety purposes. While this operation may have some impact on execution time and memory consumption, it is not significant enough to cause notable performance variations at the system level. The primary focus of this configuration is data safety rather than performance optimization."
