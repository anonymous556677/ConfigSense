    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'stream_entire_sstables' is performance-sensitive. The code context shows that this configuration directly impacts the decision to stream entire SSTables between nodes, which can have a significant effect on network transfer speed and GC pressure. Enabling this configuration involves time-extensive and memory-extensive operations related to zero-copy streaming of SSTables, leading to notable performance variations at the system level. Additionally, the developer's understanding on size impact highlights the potential performance benefits of this configuration, further supporting its classification as performance-sensitive."
