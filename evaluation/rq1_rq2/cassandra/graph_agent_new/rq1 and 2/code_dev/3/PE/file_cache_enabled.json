    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'file_cache_enabled' configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts system performance at the system level. Enabling this configuration creates an instance of ChunkCache, which stores uncompressed buffers of recently accessed sections of sstables in-memory. This can significantly reduce disk I/O operations and improve read performance. However, the configuration involves memory-expensive operations as it consumes memory resources to maintain the cache. The cache size needs to be carefully managed to avoid memory issues, indicating that the configuration has a notable performance impact at the system level."
