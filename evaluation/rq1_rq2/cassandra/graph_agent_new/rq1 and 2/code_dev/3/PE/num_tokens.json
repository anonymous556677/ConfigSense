    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'num_tokens' configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the distribution of data across nodes in the cluster, affecting the system's overall performance. The code related to 'num_tokens' involves operations that determine the token allocation algorithm, generate suitable tokens, and validate replication factors, all of which are time-expensive and memory-expensive operations. Any changes in the number of tokens can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, making it a performance-sensitive configuration."
