    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'transparent_data_encryption_options' is performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly affects system performance by enabling data encryption at-rest, which involves time-expensive encryption and decryption operations. The code context provided shows multiple methods related to encryption, decryption, and handling encrypted data, indicating that this configuration involves performance-related operations that are memory-expensive and time-extensive. These operations can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, making the configuration performance-sensitive."
