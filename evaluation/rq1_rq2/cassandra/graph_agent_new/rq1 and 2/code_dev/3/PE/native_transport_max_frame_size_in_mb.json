    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'native_transport_max_frame_size_in_mb' is performance-sensitive. This is because the maximum frame size directly impacts the system's performance by determining the size of frames that can be processed. Frames larger than the configured size are rejected, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The code context shows that the configuration is directly related to handling incoming frames and setting limits on their size, which are time-expensive and memory-expensive operations. Changing this configuration can have a significant impact on the system's memory consumption and processing time, making it performance-sensitive."
