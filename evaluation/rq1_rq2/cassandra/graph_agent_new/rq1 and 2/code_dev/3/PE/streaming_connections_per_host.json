    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'streaming_connections_per_host' is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the number of connections per host for streaming operations. This configuration is used in the code to limit the connections per host, which can significantly affect the performance of streaming operations at the system level. By adjusting this configuration, it can lead to notable performance variations by influencing the resource utilization and efficiency of streaming processes. The code context shows that the value of 'streaming_connections_per_host' is passed as a parameter in the RangeStreamer constructor, indicating its direct involvement in the performance-critical streaming processes."
