    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The 'enable_materialized_views' configuration option does not directly involve any performance-related operations that are time-expensive or memory-expensive within its related code. The configuration check is a simple boolean check to determine if materialized views are enabled or disabled. It does not lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Therefore, based on the code context and provided information, the configuration is not performance-sensitive."
