    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'allocate_tokens_for_keyspace' is performance-sensitive. This is because the code context involves operations that determine token allocation for new nodes joining the cluster, which directly impacts the performance and load balancing of the system at the system level. The allocationKeyspace parameter triggers the token allocation algorithm, which can be time-expensive and memory-expensive depending on the size of the cluster. Therefore, any changes or inefficiencies in this configuration can lead to notable performance variations in the system."
