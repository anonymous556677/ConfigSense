    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'snapshot_links_per_second' configuration is performance-sensitive. The configuration directly impacts system performance by throttling the creation or clearing of snapshot links, which can have a significant impact on system performance, especially on consumer grade SSDs. The code context shows that the configuration is used to create a RateLimiter object, indicating that it involves time-expensive operations. Additionally, the developer's understanding on triggering frequency highlights that the configuration is triggered based on the frequency of snapshot operations, further emphasizing its performance sensitivity."
