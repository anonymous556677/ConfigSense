    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'internode_tcp_user_timeout_in_ms' configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly affects the time to wait for internode TCP connections to establish, which is crucial for system performance. The code snippet provided shows that this configuration is used in determining the timeout value for messaging and streaming connections. Since the establishment of TCP connections is a time-expensive operation, any changes in the 'internode_tcp_user_timeout_in_ms' value can have a notable impact on the system's performance at the system level. Therefore, this configuration is considered performance-sensitive."
