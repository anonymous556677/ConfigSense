    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'dynamic_snitch_badness_threshold' is performance-sensitive because it directly affects the performance of the system by controlling how much worse a pinned host has to be before the dynamic snitch will prefer other replicas over it. This configuration involves time-expensive operations such as updating the dynamic snitch scores and applying configuration changes based on dynamicUpdateInterval, dynamicResetInterval, and dynamicBadnessThreshold. These operations have a notable impact on system performance at the system level, making the configuration performance-sensitive."
