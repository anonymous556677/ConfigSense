    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'server_encryption_options' configuration is performance-sensitive. The configuration involves setting up SSL contexts, creating SSL sockets, and managing SSL certificates for secure communication between servers. These operations are time-expensive and memory-expensive, directly impacting system performance at the system level. The code initializes SSL contexts, creates SSL sockets, and handles hot reloading of SSL certificates, all of which contribute to notable performance variations in the system."
