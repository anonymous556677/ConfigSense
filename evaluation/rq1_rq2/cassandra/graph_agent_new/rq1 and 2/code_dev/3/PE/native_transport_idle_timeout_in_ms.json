    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'native_transport_idle_timeout_in_ms' is considered performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly affects the system performance by managing idle client connections and closing them after a specified idle timeout period. The code snippet related to this configuration adds an IdleStateHandler to the channel pipeline, which monitors and closes idle connections. This operation is time-expensive as it involves checking for idle connections and closing them, which can have a notable performance impact at the system level. Therefore, the configuration is performance-sensitive as it contributes to significant performance variations by actively managing resources and optimizing system performance."
