{
    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'tombstone_failure_threshold' is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the 'tombstone_failure_threshold' directly impacts the performance of read operations by setting a threshold for the number of tombstones scanned. If the number of tombstones exceeds this threshold, a 'TombstoneOverwhelmingException' is thrown, affecting the performance at the system level. Additionally, the code context shows that this configuration is used to handle tombstones during read operations, which are time-expensive and memory-expensive operations, contributing to notable performance variations."
