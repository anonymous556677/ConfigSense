    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'streaming_keep_alive_period_in_secs' is classified as performance-sensitive. This is because the value of this configuration directly impacts the frequency of keep-alive messages being sent between nodes to maintain stream sessions. The code context shows that the value of 'streaming_keep_alive_period_in_secs' is used to schedule keep-alive tasks at a fixed rate, which can have a notable performance impact on the system level. A longer keep-alive period may lead to longer session timeouts, affecting system performance, while a shorter period may result in more frequent keep-alive messages being sent, also impacting performance. Therefore, any changes to this configuration can result in significant performance variations at the system level."
