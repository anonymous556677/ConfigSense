    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'cross_node_timeout' configuration is performance-sensitive. The code context shows that this configuration directly impacts the timeout information exchange between nodes, which is crucial for system efficiency and performance. Disabling this configuration can lead to wasted time processing already-timed-out requests under overload conditions, affecting system performance at the system level. Additionally, the code snippet involves conditional checks and calculations that can contribute to execution time, making it a performance-sensitive configuration."
