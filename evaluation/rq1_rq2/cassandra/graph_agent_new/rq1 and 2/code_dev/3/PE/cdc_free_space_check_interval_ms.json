    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'cdc_free_space_check_interval_ms' is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the interval specified by this configuration directly impacts the frequency of checks for available space for cdc-tracked tables. The code context reveals that this configuration triggers the calculation of CDC size and allocation of new segments based on the specified interval. A lower interval may lead to more frequent calculations and allocations, potentially increasing overhead on the system. Conversely, a higher interval may reduce the frequency of these operations but could result in delays in freeing up space for cdc-tracked tables. Therefore, the configuration directly and substantially affects system performance at the system level by influencing critical operations related to CDC size tracking and segment allocation."
