    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'batch_size_fail_threshold_in_kb' is not performance-sensitive based on the provided code context and developer information. The configuration is used to determine the threshold at which multiple-partition batches will fail, but it does not involve any performance-related operations that are time-extensive or memory-extensive within its related code. Additionally, the impact of this configuration is more focused on preventing potential issues in the system rather than directly affecting system performance at the system level."
