    "classification_result": "Performance-insensitive with 100% confidence",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'Number of keys from the counter cache to save' is related to saving keys in the counter cache, which is not directly related to any performance-sensitive operations or time-dependent aspects of system operation. Therefore, it can be classified as performance-insensitive with 100% confidence."
