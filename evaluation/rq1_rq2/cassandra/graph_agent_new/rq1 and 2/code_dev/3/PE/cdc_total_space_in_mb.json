    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'cdc_total_space_in_mb' configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts system performance at the system level. The code snippet provided shows that this configuration is used to calculate the total space available for change-data-capture logs on disk, which is a critical operation for Cassandra. If the space used for CDC logs exceeds the configured total space limit, it can lead to WriteTimeoutException on Mutations, potentially causing data loss. This configuration involves time-expensive operations like multiplication and conversion to bytes, and it directly affects system performance by determining the available space for critical logs."
