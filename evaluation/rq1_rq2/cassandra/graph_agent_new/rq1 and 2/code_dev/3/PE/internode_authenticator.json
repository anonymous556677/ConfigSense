    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'internode_authenticator' configuration is performance-sensitive. This is because setting the internode authenticator directly impacts the security and access control of peer node connections, which can have a significant performance impact at the system level. The code related to this configuration involves authentication, authorization, and role management operations, which are time-expensive and memory-expensive. Additionally, the validation of the configuration settings and the dependency on other related components further emphasize the performance sensitivity of this configuration."
