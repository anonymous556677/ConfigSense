    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'native_transport_allow_older_protocols' is performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration is directly related to decoding the protocol version and determining whether older protocols should be allowed. The code snippets related to this configuration involve operations that are time-expensive, such as decoding the protocol version and handling different protocol versions based on the configuration value. These operations can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, especially when dealing with connections and messages that require protocol version negotiation. Therefore, the configuration directly and substantially affects system performance, making it performance-sensitive."
