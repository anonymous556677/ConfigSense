    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'enable_user_defined_functions' is performance-sensitive because it directly affects system performance by enabling or disabling user-defined functions. The code snippet checks if the configuration is set to true, and if not, it throws an exception, indicating that user-defined functions are disabled. Enabling user-defined functions can have a significant impact on system performance and security, as it allows for the execution of custom code. Therefore, any changes to this configuration can lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
