    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'keyspace_count_warn_threshold' configuration is performance-sensitive. The configuration directly impacts system performance by setting a threshold for the number of keyspaces in the cluster. When the keyspace count exceeds this threshold, a warning message is logged and added to the clientWarnings set, which can significantly slow down schema-dependent cluster operations. This configuration involves time-expensive operations such as checking the keyspace count and logging warning messages, leading to notable performance variations at the system level."
