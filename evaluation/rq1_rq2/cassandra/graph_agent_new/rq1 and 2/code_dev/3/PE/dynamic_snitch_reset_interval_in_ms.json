    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'dynamic_snitch_reset_interval_in_ms' is performance-sensitive because it directly affects the system performance by controlling how often all host scores are reset. The frequency of the reset task, determined by the value of 'dynamicResetInterval', can have a significant impact on the system's behavior and performance. If the interval is set too short, it may lead to frequent resets causing potential performance variations. Conversely, a longer interval may delay necessary resets, impacting the system's responsiveness and overall performance."
