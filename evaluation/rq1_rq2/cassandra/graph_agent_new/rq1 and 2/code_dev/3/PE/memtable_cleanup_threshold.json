    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'memtable_cleanup_threshold' is classified as performance-sensitive. This is because the value of 'memtable_cleanup_threshold' directly impacts the triggering frequency of flushing the largest memtable based on the ratio of occupied non-flushing memtable size to the total permitted size. This operation is time-expensive and memory-expensive as it affects the flush activity and compaction in the system, leading to notable performance variations at the system level. The code context also shows that the 'cleaningThreshold' value is used in the creation of the MemtablePool, indicating its direct impact on system performance."
