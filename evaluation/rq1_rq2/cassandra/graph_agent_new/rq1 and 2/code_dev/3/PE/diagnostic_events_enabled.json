    "classification_result": "Performance-insensitive with 100% confidence",
    "Reason": "The configuration option for Diagnostic Events is performance-insensitive because it is related to troubleshooting operational issues and emitting events for internal state details. This configuration does not involve performance-related operations or affect system performance, making it unrelated to any time-dependent aspects of system operation."
