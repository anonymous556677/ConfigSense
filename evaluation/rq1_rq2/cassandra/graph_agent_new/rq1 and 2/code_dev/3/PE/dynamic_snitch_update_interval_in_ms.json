    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'dynamic_snitch_update_interval_in_ms' configuration is performance-sensitive. This is because it directly affects the frequency at which the more expensive part of host score calculation is performed in the code. Changing this interval can have a notable impact on the performance and accuracy of the dynamic endpoint snitch algorithm, which in turn can affect the system's behavior and load balancing decisions at the system level. The configuration involves time-expensive operations related to scheduling the update and reset tasks with fixed delays, which can lead to significant performance variations."
