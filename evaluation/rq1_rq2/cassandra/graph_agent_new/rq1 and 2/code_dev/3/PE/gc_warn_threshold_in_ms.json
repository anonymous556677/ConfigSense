    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'gc_warn_threshold_in_ms' is classified as performance-sensitive. This is because setting the threshold for logging GC pauses at WARN level directly impacts system performance by affecting the monitoring and identification of long GC pauses. The code context initializes the GCInspector class and sets up the necessary MBeans to monitor garbage collection, which involves time-expensive operations. The triggering frequency of the configuration depends on the garbage collection activity in the system, and setting a lower threshold may result in more frequent warnings being logged, impacting system performance. Therefore, the configuration directly and substantially affects system performance at the system level, making it performance-sensitive."
