    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'file_cache_size_in_mb' configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly affects the system's performance at the system level by determining the maximum memory allocated for sstable chunk cache and buffer pooling. The code snippet related to this configuration involves calculations that impact memory usage and cache size, which are crucial for system performance. The configuration leads to notable performance variations by influencing time-expensive and memory-expensive operations within the ChunkCache class, ultimately affecting the overall system performance."
