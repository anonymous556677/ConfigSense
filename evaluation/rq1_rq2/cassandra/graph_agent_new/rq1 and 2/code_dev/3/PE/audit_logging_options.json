    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The audit_logging_options configuration is performance-sensitive. This is because enabling audit logging involves logging every incoming CQL command request and authentication event, which can have a significant impact on system performance and resource usage. The code snippets related to the configuration show that the configuration directly affects the system's behavior by creating and managing audit logs, which can be memory-expensive and time-expensive operations. The configuration triggers frequently during system initialization and when the enableAuditLog method is called, potentially leading to notable performance variations at the system level. Therefore, the configuration is considered performance-sensitive."
