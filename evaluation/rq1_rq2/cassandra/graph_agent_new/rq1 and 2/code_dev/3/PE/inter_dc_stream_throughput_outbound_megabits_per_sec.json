    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'inter_dc_stream_throughput_outbound_megabits_per_sec' is classified as performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly impacts the rate at which streaming file transfer occurs between datacenters, which can have a significant effect on overall network traffic and system performance. The code snippets related to this configuration involve time-expensive operations such as updating the inter DC throughput and calculating the inter DC rate in bytes based on the configured throughput. These operations can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, making the configuration performance-sensitive."
