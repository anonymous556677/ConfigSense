    "Reason": "The configuration option 'internode_application_send_queue_reserve_endpoint_capacity_in_bytes' primarily deals with setting capacity limits for messages queued for delivery to other nodes. While this can impact memory usage and processing overhead, the code snippet provided does not contain any performance-intensive operations that would lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Therefore, the configuration is not considered performance-sensitive."
