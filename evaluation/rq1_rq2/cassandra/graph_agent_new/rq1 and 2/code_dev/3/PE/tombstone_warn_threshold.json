    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The 'tombstone_warn_threshold' configuration option is not performance-sensitive. This is because it is used to adjust the warning threshold for tombstones in the system, which does not involve any performance-related operations that are time-expensive or memory-expensive. The configuration is simply used to set a threshold value for triggering warnings based on the number of tombstones, which does not directly and substantially affect system performance at the system level."
