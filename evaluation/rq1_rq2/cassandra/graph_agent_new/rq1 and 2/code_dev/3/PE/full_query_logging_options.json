    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'full_query_logging_options' is classified as performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly impacts the performance and storage usage of the system by determining how full query logging is handled. The code context shows that the configuration involves operations that can be time-expensive and memory-expensive, such as retrieving options from binLogOptions and cassandra.yaml. These operations can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, making the configuration performance-sensitive."
