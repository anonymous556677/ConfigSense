    "config_description": "Automatically upgrade sstables after upgrade - if there is no ordinary compaction to do, the oldest non-upgraded sstable will get upgraded to the latest version automatic_sstable_upgrade: false Limit the number of concurrent sstable upgrades",
    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The configuration 'max_concurrent_automatic_sstable_upgrades' controls the maximum number of concurrent sstable upgrades that can be triggered automatically after an upgrade. The code snippet provided shows a method maybeRunUpgradeTask that checks if there are upgrade tasks available and if the number of currently background upgrading tasks is less than or equal to the value set by 'max_concurrent_automatic_sstable_upgrades'. If so, it executes the upgrade task.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The triggering frequency of the configuration 'max_concurrent_automatic_sstable_upgrades' depends on the availability of upgrade tasks and the current number of background upgrading tasks. It is triggered whenever the maybeRunUpgradeTask method is called and there are upgrade tasks available for execution.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the configuration option 'max_concurrent_automatic_sstable_upgrades' on the system is that it limits the number of concurrent sstable upgrades that can be triggered automatically. This helps in controlling the system resources and ensuring that the upgrades do not overwhelm the system. Setting a higher value for this configuration may increase the system load and resource usage, while setting a lower value may result in slower upgrade processes."
