    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The triggering frequency of the 'internode_tcp_connect_timeout_in_ms' configuration depends on the specific use case and workload of the system. It is typically triggered when establishing internode tcp connections in the system.",

A longer timeout may result in slower connection establishment but can provide more resilience against network partitions. On the other hand, a shorter timeout may lead to faster connection establishment but may increase the risk of network issues."
