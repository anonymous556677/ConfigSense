    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The configuration 'periodic_commitlog_sync_lag_block_in_ms' is used in the code to determine the number of milliseconds to block writes while waiting for a slow disk flush to complete in periodic commitlog mode. It calculates the expected sync time based on the current time and the configured block value, and waits for the sync to complete if necessary.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The triggering frequency of the 'periodic_commitlog_sync_lag_block_in_ms' configuration depends on the frequency of disk flushes and the speed of the disk. If the disk flushes are slow and cannot keep up with the write operations, this configuration will be triggered more frequently.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the 'periodic_commitlog_sync_lag_block_in_ms' configuration on the system is that it can potentially slow down the write operations if the disk flushes are slow and the configured block value is high. This can lead to increased latency in write operations and potentially affect the overall performance of the system."
