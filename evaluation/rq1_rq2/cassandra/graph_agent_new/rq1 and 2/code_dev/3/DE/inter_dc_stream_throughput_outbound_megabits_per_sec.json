    "config_description": "Throttles all streaming file transfer between the datacenters, this setting allows users to throttle inter dc stream throughput in addition to throttling all network stream traffic as configured with stream_throughput_outbound_megabits_per_sec When unset, the default is 200 Mbps or 25 MB/s",
    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The configuration 'inter_dc_stream_throughput_outbound_megabits_per_sec' is used to throttle all streaming file transfer between the datacenters. It allows users to throttle inter dc stream throughput in addition to throttling all network stream traffic as configured with 'stream_throughput_outbound_megabits_per_sec'. When unset, the default value is 200 Mbps or 25 MB/s.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The configuration is triggered whenever the 'setInterDCStreamThroughputMbPerSec' method is called to set a new value for the inter DC stream throughput. Additionally, the 'calculateInterDCRateInBytes' method is called to calculate the inter DC rate in bytes based on the configured throughput.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the 'inter_dc_stream_throughput_outbound_megabits_per_sec' configuration option is that it controls the rate at which streaming file transfer occurs between datacenters. Setting a lower value for this configuration can limit the inter DC stream throughput, potentially reducing the overall network traffic and improving system performance. Conversely, setting a higher value can increase the inter DC stream throughput but may also increase network congestion and resource utilization."
