    "config_description": "Global, per-endpoint and per-connection limits imposed on messages queued for delivery to other nodes and waiting to be processed on arrival from other nodes in the cluster.  These limits are applied to the on-wire size of the message being sent or received.  The basic per-link limit is consumed in isolation before any endpoint or global limit is imposed. Each node-pair has three links: urgent, small and large.  So any given node may have a maximum of N*3*(internode_application_send_queue_capacity_in_bytes+internode_application_receive_queue_capacity_in_bytes) messages queued without any coordination between them although in practice, with token-aware routing, only RF*tokens nodes should need to communicate with significant bandwidth.  The per-endpoint limit is imposed on all messages exceeding the per-link limit, simultaneously with the global limit, on all links to or from a single node in the cluster. The global limit is imposed on all messages exceeding the per-link limit, simultaneously with the per-endpoint limit, on all links to or from any node in the cluster. ",
    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The configuration code checks if the applicationSendQueueCapacityInBytes is not null, it returns the value of applicationSendQueueCapacityInBytes. If it is null, it retrieves the value from DatabaseDescriptor.getInternodeApplicationSendQueueCapacityInBytes(). This method is used to get the application send queue capacity in bytes.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The triggering frequency of the configuration depends on the usage of the application and the volume of messages being sent or received between nodes in the cluster. It is triggered whenever the application needs to send or receive messages and the queue capacity needs to be checked.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The configuration option internode_application_send_queue_capacity_in_bytes sets limits on the size of messages queued for delivery between nodes in the cluster. It helps in managing the message queue size and prevents overwhelming the system with a large number of messages. Setting this configuration too low may result in message drops or delays in message delivery, while setting it too high may consume excessive memory and impact system performance."
