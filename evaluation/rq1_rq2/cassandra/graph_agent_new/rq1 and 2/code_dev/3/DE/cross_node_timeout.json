    "config_description": "Enable operation timeout information exchange between nodes to accurately measure request timeouts.  If disabled, replicas will assume that requests were forwarded to them instantly by the coordinator, which means that under overload conditions we will waste that much extra time processing already-timed-out requests.  Warning: It is generally assumed that users have setup NTP on their clusters, and that clocks are modestly in sync, since this is a requirement for general correctness of last write wins.",
    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The configuration 'cross_node_timeout' is checked in the method getExpiresAtNanos to determine if operation timeout information exchange between nodes should be enabled. If the DatabaseDescriptor hasCrossNodeTimeout() returns false or the createdAtNanos is greater than the currentTimeNanos, the createdAtNanos is set to the currentTimeNanos. The method then returns the sum of createdAtNanos and expirationPeriodNanos.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The triggering frequency of the 'cross_node_timeout' configuration depends on the usage of the getExpiresAtNanos method in the system. If this method is called frequently for operations that involve timeout information exchange between nodes, then the configuration will be triggered accordingly.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the 'cross_node_timeout' configuration option is significant for accurately measuring request timeouts between nodes. If disabled, replicas may assume requests were forwarded instantly, leading to wasted time processing already-timed-out requests under overload conditions. It is crucial for system efficiency and performance to have this configuration enabled, especially in scenarios where nodes may experience clock drift or lack of synchronization."
