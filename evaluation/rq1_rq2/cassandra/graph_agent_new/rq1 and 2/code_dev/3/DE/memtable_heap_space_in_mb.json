    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The configuration 'memtable_heap_space_in_mb' is used to set the total permitted memory to use for memtables in the system. The code snippet provided shows how this configuration is used to calculate the heapLimit and offHeapLimit for the memtable allocator pool.",

When the memtable size exceeds the cleanup threshold, a flush will be triggered to free up memory for new writes.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the 'memtable_heap_space_in_mb' configuration option on the system is significant. If the configured memory limit is too low, Cassandra may stop accepting writes until a flush completes, leading to potential performance degradation. On the other hand, setting a high memory limit may consume more system resources, affecting overall system performance."
