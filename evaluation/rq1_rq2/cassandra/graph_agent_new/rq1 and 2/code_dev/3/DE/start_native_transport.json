    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the 'start_native_transport' configuration option is significant as it determines whether the native transport server is started or not. Starting the native transport server allows clients to connect to the Cassandra cluster using the native protocol, enabling faster and more efficient communication."
