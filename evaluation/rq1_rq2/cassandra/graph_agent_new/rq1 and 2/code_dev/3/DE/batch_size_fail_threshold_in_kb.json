    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The configuration 'batch_size_fail_threshold_in_kb' is used to determine the threshold at which multiple-partition batches will fail. It is retrieved using the method getBatchSizeFailureThreshold() which internally calls DatabaseDescriptor.getBatchSizeFailThresholdInKB().",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The triggering frequency of the 'batch_size_fail_threshold_in_kb' configuration depends on the batch size of multiple-partition batches being processed. If a batch exceeds the specified threshold, it will trigger the configuration.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the 'batch_size_fail_threshold_in_kb' configuration option is that it helps in preventing large multiple-partition batches from causing issues in the system. By setting a threshold, it ensures that batches above a certain size are failed, preventing potential performance degradation or overload on the system."
