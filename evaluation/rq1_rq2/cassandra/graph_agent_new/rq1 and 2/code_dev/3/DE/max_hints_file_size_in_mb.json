    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The configuration 'max_hints_file_size_in_mb' is used to set the maximum size for a single hints file in megabytes. In the provided code snippet, the value of 'maxHintsFileSize' is retrieved using 'DatabaseDescriptor.getMaxHintsFileSize()' and is used to determine when to break the loop while writing hints to a file.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The triggering frequency of the 'max_hints_file_size_in_mb' configuration depends on the size of the hints being written. When the size of the hints being written exceeds the configured 'maxHintsFileSize', the loop breaks and a new hints file is created.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the 'max_hints_file_size_in_mb' configuration option is that it limits the size of individual hints files. This can help in managing disk space usage and preventing individual hints files from becoming too large, which could potentially impact system performance."
