    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'memtable_heap_space_in_mb' configuration is classified as performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly impacts the total memory allocated for memtables in Cassandra, which can significantly affect system performance. The code snippet provided shows that the value of 'memtable_heap_space_in_mb' is used to calculate the heapLimit and offHeapLimit for the MemtablePool, which are critical for managing memory usage efficiently. Setting a low memory limit can lead to frequent flushes and impact system performance, while setting a high memory limit can increase the risk of running out of memory. Therefore, tuning this configuration is crucial for optimizing system performance at the system level."
