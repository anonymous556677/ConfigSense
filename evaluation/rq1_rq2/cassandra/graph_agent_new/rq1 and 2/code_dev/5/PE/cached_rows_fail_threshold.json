    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'cached_rows_fail_threshold' is performance-sensitive because it directly affects the behavior of the ReplicaFilteringProtection, which involves time-expensive operations related to handling potentially out-of-date rows. The configuration is passed as a parameter to the ReplicaFilteringProtection constructor, where it determines the fail threshold for cached replica rows. Setting a lower threshold may lead to more rows being marked as out-of-date, triggering additional processing steps that can impact system performance. Therefore, the configuration directly influences the performance of the system at the system level by affecting the processing of potentially out-of-date rows."
