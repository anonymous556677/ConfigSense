    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'index_summary_capacity_in_mb' configuration option is classified as performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly impacts the memory pool size for SSTable index summaries, which can significantly affect the memory usage and performance of the system. The code snippet provided initializes the memory pool size based on this configuration, indicating that it involves memory-expensive operations. If the memory usage exceeds the configured limit, SSTables with low read rates will shrink their index summaries to meet this limit, further impacting system performance. Therefore, the configuration is considered performance-sensitive as it leads to notable performance variations at the system level."
