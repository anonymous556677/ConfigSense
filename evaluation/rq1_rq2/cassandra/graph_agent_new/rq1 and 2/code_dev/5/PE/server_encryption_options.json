    "Reason": "The 'server_encryption_options' configuration is not performance-sensitive. Although it involves setting up encryption options for server-to-server communication, the code primarily focuses on configuring SSL protocols and cipher suites. These operations are essential for security but do not directly contribute to notable performance variations at the system level. The configuration is more security-focused rather than performance-focused."
