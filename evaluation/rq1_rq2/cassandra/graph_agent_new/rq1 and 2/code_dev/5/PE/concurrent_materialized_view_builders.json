    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'concurrent_materialized_view_builders' configuration is performance-sensitive. This is because it directly impacts the system's ability to handle multiple materialized view builder tasks simultaneously. The configuration controls the number of concurrent view builders allowed, which can significantly affect the system's performance in building materialized views. The code context includes methods to get and set this configuration value, emphasizing its importance in managing system resources efficiently."
