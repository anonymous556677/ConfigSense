    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'range_request_timeout_in_ms' configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly affects the performance of sequential and index scans in the system. The code context shows that this configuration is used in methods like getTimeout and getRangeRpcTimeout to retrieve the configured timeout value in milliseconds. The timeout value set for this configuration can significantly impact the execution time of these scans, leading to notable performance variations at the system level. Therefore, any changes to this configuration can have a substantial impact on the system's overall performance."
