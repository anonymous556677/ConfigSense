    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'memtable_cleanup_threshold' is classified as performance-sensitive. This is because the value of 'cleaningThreshold' directly impacts the triggering of flushes for the largest memtable, which can significantly affect system performance. The 'cleaningThreshold' is used in the creation of different MemtablePools based on the memtable allocation type, and a higher value for the threshold can result in larger flushes and less compaction, impacting disk activity and system throughput. Therefore, the configuration involves performance-related operations that have a notable performance impact at the system level."
