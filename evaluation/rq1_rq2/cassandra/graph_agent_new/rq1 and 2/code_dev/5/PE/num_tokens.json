    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'num_tokens' configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly affects the distribution of data across the cluster, impacting the system's overall performance. The 'getBootstrapTokens' method, which retrieves the bootstrap tokens based on this configuration, involves operations that contribute to execution time and memory consumption. The number of tokens assigned to a node can significantly influence the system's performance by affecting data distribution and storage efficiency, making it a critical configuration for system performance."
