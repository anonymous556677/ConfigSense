    "Reason": "The 'diagnostic_events_enabled' configuration is not performance-sensitive based on the provided code context and developer's information. The configuration is simply used to determine if diagnostic events are enabled in the system, and it does not involve any time-expensive or memory-expensive operations that would lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The configuration check is straightforward and does not have a significant impact on system performance."
