    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'truncate_request_timeout_in_ms' is performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly affects the timeout for truncates to complete, which can have a significant impact on system performance. The code snippets related to the configuration involve time-expensive operations such as calculating timeout values and handling timeout exceptions, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Therefore, the configuration is considered performance-sensitive based on its direct and substantial impact on system performance."
