    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'allocate_tokens_for_keyspace' configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the token allocation strategy, which in turn affects data distribution, load balancing, and overall system performance. The code context provided shows that the configuration involves time-expensive operations such as token allocation algorithms and random token selection, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Therefore, the configuration is considered performance-sensitive based on its significant impact on system performance."
