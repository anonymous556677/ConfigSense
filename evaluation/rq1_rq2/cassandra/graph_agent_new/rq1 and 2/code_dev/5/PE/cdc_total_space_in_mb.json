    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'cdc_total_space_in_mb' is classified as performance-sensitive. The code context shows that this configuration directly impacts the total space available for change-data-capture logs on disk, which can have a significant impact on system performance. The developer's explanation also highlights that if the allocated space is insufficient, it can lead to WriteTimeoutExceptions on Mutations, affecting system reliability and performance. Therefore, the configuration involves performance-related operations that are memory-expensive and can lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
