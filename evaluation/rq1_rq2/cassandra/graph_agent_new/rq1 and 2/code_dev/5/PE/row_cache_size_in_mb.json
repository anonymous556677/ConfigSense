    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'row_cache_size_in_mb' configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the system's performance by allocating memory for the row cache. The code snippets provided show that the configuration value is used to set the capacity of the cache in bytes, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Increasing the size of the row cache can potentially improve performance by caching more data in memory, but it also comes with the risk of increased memory usage and potential performance degradation if not managed properly. Therefore, the configuration involves performance-related operations that are memory-expensive and can have a significant impact on system performance."
