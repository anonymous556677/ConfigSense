    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'repaired_data_tracking_for_range_reads_enabled' is performance-sensitive. The code context shows that enabling this configuration adds overhead to range read operations by tracking repaired data for all range reads when there are multiple full replicas to compare results from. This additional tracking involves time-expensive operations such as filtering full replicas and creating messages for each replica, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Therefore, the configuration directly and substantially affects system performance by introducing additional processing steps for range read operations, making it performance-sensitive."
