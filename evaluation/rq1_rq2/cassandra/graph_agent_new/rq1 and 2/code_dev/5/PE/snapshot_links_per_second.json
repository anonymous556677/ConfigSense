    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'snapshot_links_per_second' configuration is considered performance-sensitive because it directly affects system performance by throttling the creation or clearing of snapshot links. The code context shows that this configuration is used to create a RateLimiter object, which indicates that it involves time-expensive operations. Additionally, the developer's understanding highlights the significant impact of this configuration on performance, especially in avoiding negative performance impact on consumer grade SSDs. Therefore, the configuration's involvement in time-expensive operations and its substantial impact on system performance make it performance-sensitive."
