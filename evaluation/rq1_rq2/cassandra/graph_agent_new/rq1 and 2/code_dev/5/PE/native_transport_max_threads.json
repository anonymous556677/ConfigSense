    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The native_transport_max_threads configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly affects the system's ability to handle concurrent requests efficiently. In the provided code context, the configuration is used to set the maximum number of threads for handling requests in the native transport layer. The requestExecutor LocalAwareExecutorService instance is created with this configuration, indicating that it plays a crucial role in the execution of request processing. Since the number of threads directly impacts the system's performance in handling requests, any changes to this configuration can lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
