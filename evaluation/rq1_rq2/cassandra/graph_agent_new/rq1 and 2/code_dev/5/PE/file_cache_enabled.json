    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'file_cache_enabled' configuration is performance-sensitive. This is because enabling this configuration directly affects system performance by storing recently accessed sections of the sstable in-memory as uncompressed buffers, which can significantly improve read performance by reducing disk access. The code related to this configuration involves time-expensive operations such as loading buffers into memory and caching chunks, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Additionally, the configuration involves memory-expensive operations due to the consumption of memory resources for caching, further emphasizing its performance sensitivity."
