    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'internode_application_send_queue_reserve_endpoint_capacity_in_bytes' is not performance-sensitive. The code snippet provided is primarily focused on setting default reserve limits for outbound connections by retrieving values for endpoint capacity and global capacity. While it does impact the system by managing the message queue size and ensuring efficient communication within the cluster, it does not involve any performance-related operations that are time-extensive or memory-extensive. The configuration does not directly and substantially affect system performance at the system level, leading to notable performance variations. Therefore, it is classified as not performance-sensitive."
