    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'tombstone_failure_threshold' configuration is performance-sensitive. This is because it directly impacts the execution of read queries by setting a threshold for the number of tombstones scanned. If the threshold is exceeded, a TombstoneOverwhelmingException is thrown, aborting the query. This configuration affects the system performance at the system level by controlling the behavior of read queries based on the number of tombstones encountered. The code context shows that this configuration is crucial for handling tombstones efficiently during read operations, and any misconfiguration can lead to significant performance variations and query aborts."
