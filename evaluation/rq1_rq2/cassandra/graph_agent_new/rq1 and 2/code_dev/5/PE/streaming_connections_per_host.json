    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'streaming_connections_per_host' configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the number of connections per host for streaming operations. This can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, especially in scenarios where a few nodes have large files and increasing the connections per host can help distribute the workload more efficiently. The configuration is used in the code to limit the number of connections per host for streaming, and it is retrieved using 'DatabaseDescriptor.getStreamingConnectionsPerHost()' and passed as a parameter to the RangeStreamer constructor, indicating its direct influence on performance-related operations."
