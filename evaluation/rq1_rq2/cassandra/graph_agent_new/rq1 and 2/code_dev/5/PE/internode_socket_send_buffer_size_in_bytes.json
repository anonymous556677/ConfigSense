    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'internode_socket_send_buffer_size_in_bytes' is classified as performance-sensitive. This is because the code context shows that the configuration directly impacts the socket send buffer size for internode communication, which can significantly affect network throughput and latency. The configuration involves retrieving the buffer size and can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, making it performance-sensitive."
