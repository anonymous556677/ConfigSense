    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'slow_query_log_timeout_in_ms' is performance-sensitive because it directly affects system performance by determining the threshold for logging slow queries. The code snippet related to this configuration involves monitoring the execution time of select queries and setting the timeout value for slow query logging. This operation is time-expensive and can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, especially when dealing with slow queries. Therefore, the configuration is considered performance-sensitive."
