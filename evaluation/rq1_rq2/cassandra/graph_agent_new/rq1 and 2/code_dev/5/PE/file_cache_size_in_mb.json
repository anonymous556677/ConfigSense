    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'file_cache_size_in_mb' configuration is performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly impacts the memory allocation for sstable chunk cache and buffer pooling, which are critical components affecting system performance. The calculation of cache size based on the configuration value and the reserved pool space of 32MB shows that the configuration plays a significant role in determining the memory usage for caching and pooling operations. Any changes in this configuration can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, making it a performance-sensitive parameter."
