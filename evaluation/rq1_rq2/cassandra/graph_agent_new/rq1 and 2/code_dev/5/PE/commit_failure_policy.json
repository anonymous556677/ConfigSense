    "Reason": "The 'commit_failure_policy' configuration does not involve any performance-related operations that are time-extensive or memory-extensive within its related code. The code snippet provided mainly handles different commit failure policies and performs actions based on the policy set. While the configuration may have a significant impact on system behavior, it does not directly and substantially affect system performance at the system level in terms of notable performance variations. Therefore, it is not classified as performance-sensitive."
