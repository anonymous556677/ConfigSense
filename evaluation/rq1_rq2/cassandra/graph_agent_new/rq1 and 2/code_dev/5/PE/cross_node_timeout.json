    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The 'cross_node_timeout' configuration does not directly involve any performance-related operations that are time-extensive or memory-extensive within its related code. The configuration simply checks if cross node timeout is enabled and adjusts the createdAtNanos value if necessary. This operation is not time-expensive or memory-expensive and does not lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Therefore, it is classified as not performance-sensitive."
