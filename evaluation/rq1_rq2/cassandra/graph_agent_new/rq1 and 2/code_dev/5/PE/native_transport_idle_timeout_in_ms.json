    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'native_transport_idle_timeout_in_ms' configuration is performance-sensitive. The configuration directly affects system performance by managing idle client connections and closing them after a specified timeout. The code snippet provided adds an IdleStateHandler to the channel pipeline with the specified idle timeout value, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. By efficiently handling idle connections, the configuration helps in freeing up resources and improving system performance, making it performance-sensitive."
