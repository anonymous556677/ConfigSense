    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The initial_token configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the token assignment for nodes in the cluster, which can significantly affect the distribution of data and load balancing in the system. The code context shows that the configuration involves operations that are time-expensive, such as generating suitable tokens based on manual input or using an allocation algorithm. These operations can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, making the configuration performance-sensitive."
