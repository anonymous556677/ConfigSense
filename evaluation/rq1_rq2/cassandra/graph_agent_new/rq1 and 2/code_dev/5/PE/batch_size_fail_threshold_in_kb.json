    "Reason": "The configuration option 'batch_size_fail_threshold_in_kb' is not performance-sensitive. The code snippet provided simply retrieves the value of the configuration from DatabaseDescriptor without any performance-intensive operations. The configuration is used to set a threshold for batch processing to prevent performance issues, but it does not directly impact system performance at a significant level. Therefore, it does not lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
