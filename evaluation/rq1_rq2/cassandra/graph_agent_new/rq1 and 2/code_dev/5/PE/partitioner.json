    "Reason": "The 'partitioner' configuration is not performance-sensitive. Although it affects how data is distributed across nodes, changing the partitioner does not directly impact the performance of individual operations or cause notable performance variations at the system level. The configuration is primarily used for data distribution and does not involve time-expensive or memory-expensive operations within its related code."
