    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'snapshot_before_compaction' is performance-sensitive. The code context reveals that when the configuration is set to true, a snapshot is taken before each compaction process, which involves time-expensive and memory-expensive operations like snapshot creation and disk space usage. This can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, especially if compaction occurs frequently. The developer's understanding also confirms that the configuration can impact disk space usage, affecting the overall storage capacity of the system. Therefore, the configuration directly and substantially affects system performance, making it performance-sensitive."
