{
    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'internode_application_send_queue_reserve_global_capacity_in_bytes' is classified as performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly impacts the system's performance and resource utilization by setting limits on queued messages for delivery between nodes in the cluster. The code context provided shows that the configuration is enforced whenever a message exceeds the specified capacity, indicating that it involves performance-related operations that can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Additionally, the developer's understanding on the size impact of the configuration highlights the significant impact it has on the system's performance and resource utilization, further supporting the classification of the configuration as performance-sensitive."
