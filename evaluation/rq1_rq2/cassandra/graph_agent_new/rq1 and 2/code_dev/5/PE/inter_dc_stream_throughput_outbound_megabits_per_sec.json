    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'inter_dc_stream_throughput_outbound_megabits_per_sec' is performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly impacts the throttling of streaming file transfer between datacenters, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The code snippets related to this configuration involve time-expensive operations such as updating the inter DC throughput and calculating the inter DC rate in bytes based on the configuration value. These operations can have a significant impact on system performance, making the configuration performance-sensitive."
