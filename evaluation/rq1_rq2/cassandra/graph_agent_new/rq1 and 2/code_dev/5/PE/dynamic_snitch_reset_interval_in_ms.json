    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'dynamic_snitch_reset_interval_in_ms' configuration is considered performance-sensitive. This is because the reset interval directly impacts the behavior of the DynamicEndpointSnitch in resetting host scores, which can have a notable performance variation at the system level. The code initializes scheduled tasks for update and reset based on the configured interval, showing that the configuration involves time-expensive operations that can affect system performance. Additionally, the developer's understanding of the impact on bad hosts' recovery and system behavior further supports the classification of this configuration as performance-sensitive."
