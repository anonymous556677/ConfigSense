    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The 'disk_failure_policy' configuration does not involve any performance-related operations that are time-extensive or memory-extensive within its related code. The code snippets related to handling disk failures do not contribute significantly to execution time or memory consumption. Although the configuration impacts system behavior in response to disk failures, it does not directly and substantially affect system performance at the system level. Therefore, it is classified as not performance-sensitive."
