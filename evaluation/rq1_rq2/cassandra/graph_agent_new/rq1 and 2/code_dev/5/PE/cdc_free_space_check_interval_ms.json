    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'cdc_free_space_check_interval_ms' configuration is performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly impacts the system performance by managing space for cdc-tracked tables. The code related to this configuration involves operations that are time-expensive, such as periodic checks for available space, and memory-expensive, as it deals with tracking and managing CDC data. These operations can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, making the configuration performance-sensitive."
