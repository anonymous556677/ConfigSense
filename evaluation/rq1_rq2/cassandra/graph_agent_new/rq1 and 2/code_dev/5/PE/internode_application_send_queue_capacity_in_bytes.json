{
    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'internode_application_send_queue_capacity_in_bytes' is classified as performance-sensitive. This is because the method 'applicationSendQueueCapacityInBytes' involves retrieving the send queue capacity in bytes, which directly impacts the amount of messages that can be queued for delivery to other nodes. This operation is time-expensive as it sets limits on the queue capacity, affecting the efficiency of communication between nodes in the cluster. Additionally, the configuration directly affects system performance at the system level by managing the on-wire size of messages being sent and preventing overload. Therefore, the configuration is considered performance-sensitive based on its significant impact on system performance and the time-expensive operation within its related code."
