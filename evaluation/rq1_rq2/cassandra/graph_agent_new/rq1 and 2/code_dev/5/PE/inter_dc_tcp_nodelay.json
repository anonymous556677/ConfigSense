{
    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'inter_dc_tcp_nodelay' is classified as performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly impacts the performance of the system at the system level by enabling or disabling tcp_nodelay for inter-dc communication. The code context provided shows that the configuration involves performance-related operations that determine the size of network packets being sent, which can have a notable performance impact. Enabling or disabling tcp_nodelay can affect latency and overall system performance, making it a performance-sensitive configuration."
