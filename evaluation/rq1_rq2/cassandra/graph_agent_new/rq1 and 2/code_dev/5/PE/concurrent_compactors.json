    "Reason": "The 'concurrent_compactors' configuration directly affects the number of simultaneous compactions in the system, which can have a significant impact on system performance. The code context shows that this configuration is used to control the number of concurrent compactions, which are time-expensive operations. Adjusting this configuration can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, making it performance-sensitive."
