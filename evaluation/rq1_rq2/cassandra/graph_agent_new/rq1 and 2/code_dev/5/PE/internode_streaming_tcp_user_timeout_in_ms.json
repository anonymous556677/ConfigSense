{
    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'internode_streaming_tcp_user_timeout_in_ms' is classified as performance-sensitive because it directly affects the stability and reliability of streaming connections in the system. The code snippet provided shows that the configuration is used to check the processing time of incoming stream messages against the timeout value. If the processing time exceeds the timeout value, a warning is logged, indicating a potential issue with the streaming connection. This operation is time-expensive and can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, making the configuration performance-sensitive."
