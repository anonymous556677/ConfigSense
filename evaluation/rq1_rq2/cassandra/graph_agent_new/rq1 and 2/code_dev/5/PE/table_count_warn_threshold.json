    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'table_count_warn_threshold' configuration is performance-sensitive. The configuration directly impacts system performance by setting a threshold for the number of tables in the cluster. If the number of tables exceeds this threshold, a warning message is logged, which can slow down schema-dependent cluster operations. The code snippet related to this configuration involves time-expensive operations such as getting the number of tables and checking if it exceeds the threshold, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
