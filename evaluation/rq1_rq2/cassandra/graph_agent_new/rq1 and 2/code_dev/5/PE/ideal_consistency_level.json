    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'ideal_consistency_level' configuration is performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration involves tracking and comparing the ideal consistency level with the requested consistency levels for each write operation. This comparison operation adds overhead and complexity to the system, potentially impacting performance, especially under high write loads. The code context shows that the configuration directly affects the selection of the appropriate response handler based on the ideal consistency level, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
