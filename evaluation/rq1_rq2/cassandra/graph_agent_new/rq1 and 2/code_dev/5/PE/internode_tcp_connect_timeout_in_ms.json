{
    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'internode_tcp_connect_timeout_in_ms' is classified as performance-sensitive. This is because the timeout value directly impacts the time taken for internode TCP connections to establish in Cassandra, which is a critical operation for the system. The code snippet provided shows that the configuration involves time-expensive operations related to establishing TCP connections. Changes in the timeout value can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, affecting the responsiveness and reliability of the system. Therefore, the configuration is considered performance-sensitive."
