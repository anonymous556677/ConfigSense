    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'streaming_keep_alive_period_in_secs' is performance-sensitive. The code context shows that this configuration directly impacts the scheduling of keep-alive tasks in the system, which involves time-expensive operations such as sending keep-alive messages at a fixed rate. The frequency of these messages is determined by the value of 'streaming_keep_alive_period_in_secs', making it a critical factor in the performance and stability of streaming sessions. Changes in this configuration can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, making it a performance-sensitive configuration."
