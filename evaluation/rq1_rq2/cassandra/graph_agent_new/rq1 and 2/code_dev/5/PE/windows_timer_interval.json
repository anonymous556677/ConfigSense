    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'windows_timer_interval' is performance-sensitive. The adjustment of the system timer on Windows from the default 15ms down to the minimum of 1ms directly impacts timer intervals, thread scheduling, driver interrupts, etc. This adjustment involves time-expensive operations that can significantly affect system performance at the system level. Changing this setting can lead to notable performance variations, providing much tighter latency and better throughput. Additionally, the configuration is triggered during daemon activation and forceful termination, which can have a frequent impact on system performance."
