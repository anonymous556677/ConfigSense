    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'repair_session_space_in_mb' configuration is classified as performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly impacts the memory allocation for Merkle tree calculations during repairs, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The code snippet shows that the configuration is used to calculate the available memory for creating Merkle trees, and adjusting this configuration can affect the memory budget for repairs. Since memory allocation is a critical factor in performance optimization, any changes to this configuration can have a significant impact on the overall performance of repair operations."
