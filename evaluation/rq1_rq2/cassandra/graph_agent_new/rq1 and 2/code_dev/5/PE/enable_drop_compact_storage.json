    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'enable_drop_compact_storage' is performance-sensitive. This is because the code context shows that the configuration directly impacts the execution of 'ALTER ... DROP COMPACT STORAGE' statements on tables, which can have a significant performance impact at the system level. The 'DatabaseDescriptor.enableDropCompactStorage()' method is a performance-related operation that determines whether the compact storage can be dropped, and this operation can lead to notable performance variations based on its return value. Additionally, the developer's understanding mentions that enabling this configuration can impact storage size and performance, further emphasizing its performance sensitivity."
