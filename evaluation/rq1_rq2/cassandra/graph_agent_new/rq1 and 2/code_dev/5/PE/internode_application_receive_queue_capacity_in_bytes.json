    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'internode_application_receive_queue_capacity_in_bytes' is performance-sensitive. This is because it directly affects the amount of memory allocated for queuing messages, which can impact system performance at the system level. The code context reveals that this configuration sets limits on the size of messages that can be queued for delivery or processing, indicating that it involves memory-expensive operations. Additionally, the configuration is triggered whenever messages are sent or received between nodes, showing that it can lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
