    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'transparent_data_encryption_options' configuration is performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration involves encryption operations that are time-expensive and memory-expensive within the related code. The code context shows the creation of encryption components, handling of encryption keys, and reading/writing encrypted data. These operations can have a notable performance impact at the system level, especially during write operations involving disk I/O. Additionally, the configuration directly affects system performance by introducing overhead for encryption, key management, and additional resource consumption."
