    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'native_transport_max_frame_size_in_mb' is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that changing this configuration directly impacts the system's performance at the system level. By setting the maximum size of allowed frames, it affects the memory consumption and processing time of the system. The code related to this configuration involves operations that handle the size of frames and directly impact the execution time and memory usage, making it a performance-sensitive configuration."
