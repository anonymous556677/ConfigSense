    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'sstable_preemptive_open_interval_in_mb' is performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly affects the open interval for replacement sstables during compaction, which is a critical operation in the system. The code snippet shows that the interval is calculated based on the value of 'sstable_preemptive_open_interval_in_mb' and certain conditions can set the interval to Long.MAX_VALUE, indicating a significant impact on system performance. Additionally, the developer's explanation highlights the importance of this configuration in optimizing read performance and reducing the impact of compaction on overall system performance, further emphasizing its performance sensitivity."
