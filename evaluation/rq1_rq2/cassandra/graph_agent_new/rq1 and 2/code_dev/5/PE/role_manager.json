    "Reason": "The configuration option is not performance-sensitive because it primarily deals with authentication and authorization operations, which are essential for security and access control. While these operations may have an impact on system performance, the main focus is on ensuring data security rather than optimizing performance. The code mainly handles user permissions, role management, and authentication checks, which are critical for system functionality but not directly related to performance optimization."
