    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'write_request_timeout_in_ms' configuration is performance-sensitive. This configuration directly affects the timeout for write operations in the system, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The code context shows that this configuration is used to calculate timeouts for write requests, and the timeout directly impacts the performance of write operations. Therefore, any changes to this configuration can have a significant impact on system performance."
