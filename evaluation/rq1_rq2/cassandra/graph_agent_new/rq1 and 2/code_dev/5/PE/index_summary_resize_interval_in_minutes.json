    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'index_summary_resize_interval_in_minutes' is performance-sensitive. The code context shows that this configuration directly impacts the memory distribution within the system by determining how frequently index summaries are resampled. This resampling process involves memory-expensive operations that redistribute memory from a fixed-size pool to sstables based on their read rates. The frequency of this resampling process, controlled by the 'DatabaseDescriptor.getIndexSummaryResizeIntervalInMinutes()' value, directly affects system performance at the system level by influencing memory usage and distribution. Therefore, the configuration is considered performance-sensitive as it leads to notable performance variations at the system level."
