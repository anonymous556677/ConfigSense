    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'stream_throughput_outbound_megabits_per_sec' is performance-sensitive. The code context provided shows that this configuration directly affects the maximum outbound stream throughput, which can have a significant impact on the system's performance at the system level. The method 'calculateRateInBytes' also indicates that this configuration involves performance-related operations that calculate the rate in bytes based on the configured throughput, showing that it contributes to time-expensive operations. Additionally, the developer's understanding on the size impact highlights that this configuration plays a crucial role in throttling streaming file transfers between datacenters, further emphasizing its performance sensitivity."
