    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'tombstone_warn_threshold' configuration is performance-sensitive. This is because it directly affects the performance and memory usage of the system by adjusting the thresholds for scanning tombstones in memory during scans. The configuration involves performance-related operations such as adjusting the warning threshold value for tombstones, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The code context shows that this configuration is used to set the warning threshold value for tombstones, impacting the efficiency of tombstone scanning and memory consumption during read operations."
