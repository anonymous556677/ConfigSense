    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'internode_tcp_user_timeout_in_ms' is not performance-sensitive based on the provided code context and developer information. The code snippet shows that the configuration is used to set the timeout value for internode TCP connections in Cassandra, which is essential for network stability and preventing network issues. However, the configuration itself does not involve any performance-related operations that are time-expensive or memory-expensive. It simply retrieves timeout values from the DatabaseDescriptor based on the connection category. Therefore, the configuration does not directly and substantially affect system performance at the system level, leading to notable performance variations. Additionally, the developer's understanding of the configuration's impact on system performance and size impact also supports the classification as not performance-sensitive."
