    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'network_authorizer' configuration is performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly impacts system performance by managing permissions related to network access, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The code related to the 'network_authorizer' configuration includes operations that check user permissions for data center access, which are time-expensive and memory-expensive. Additionally, the configuration is triggered frequently whenever a user attempts to access a data center, indicating its significant impact on system performance."
