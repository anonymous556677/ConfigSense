    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The dynamic_snitch_badness_threshold configuration is performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly affects the behavior of the dynamic snitch in selecting replicas based on the badness threshold percentage. The badness threshold controls how much worse a pinned host has to be before the dynamic snitch will prefer other replicas over it, impacting the performance and load balancing of the system. The configuration-related code includes operations that update the dynamicUpdateInterval, dynamicResetInterval, and dynamicBadnessThreshold values in the DatabaseDescriptor, which trigger the applyConfigChanges() method to update the configuration and restart the update-scheduler and reset-scheduler tasks if the rates have changed. These operations have a direct and substantial impact on system performance at the system level, making the configuration performance-sensitive."
