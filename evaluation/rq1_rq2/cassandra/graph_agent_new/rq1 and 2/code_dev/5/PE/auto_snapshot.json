    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The 'auto_snapshot' configuration option is not performance-sensitive based on the provided code context and developer information. The configuration mainly deals with taking a snapshot before potentially data-destructive operations like truncation or dropping of column families to ensure data safety. While taking a snapshot can have some impact on memory usage and execution time, it is not a time-extensive or memory-extensive operation that would lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Additionally, the configuration does not directly and substantially affect system performance, as its primary purpose is data safety rather than performance optimization."
