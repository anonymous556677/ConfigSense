    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'enable_user_defined_functions' is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the system performance by enabling or disabling user-defined functions. The code snippet checks if the configuration is set to true, and if not, it throws an exception, which can affect the execution flow and potentially cause performance variations. User-defined functions can be time-expensive and memory-expensive operations, so enabling or disabling them through this configuration can lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
