    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'memtable_offheap_space_in_mb' configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly and substantially affects system performance at the system level. The code snippet provided shows that this configuration is used to calculate the off-heap limit for the MemtablePool, which is crucial for managing memory usage in Cassandra. Setting this configuration too low can lead to frequent flushes and impact system performance, while setting it too high can result in excessive memory usage. Therefore, any changes to this configuration can have a notable impact on system performance, making it performance-sensitive."
