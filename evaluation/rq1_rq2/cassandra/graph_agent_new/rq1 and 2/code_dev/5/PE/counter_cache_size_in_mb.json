    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'counter_cache_size_in_mb' configuration is performance-sensitive. This is because the size of the counter cache directly impacts the memory consumption of the system, which can lead to notable performance variations. The code snippet provided shows that the size of the counter cache is calculated in bytes based on the value set for 'counter_cache_size_in_mb'. This memory-intensive operation can have a significant impact on system performance, especially in scenarios where a higher value can improve performance by reducing contention for hot counter cells. Additionally, the developer's understanding mentions that setting a lower value may result in not loading the hottest keys on startup, further emphasizing the performance sensitivity of this configuration."
