{
    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'compaction_throughput_mb_per_sec' is performance-sensitive because it directly affects the speed and efficiency of the compaction process at the system level. The code context shows that this configuration is used to set the rate limit for compaction, which can have a significant impact on the overall system performance. Additionally, the developer's understanding emphasizes the importance of setting this configuration to an optimal value to avoid performance bottlenecks. Therefore, based on the code context and developer's information, the configuration is classified as performance-sensitive."
