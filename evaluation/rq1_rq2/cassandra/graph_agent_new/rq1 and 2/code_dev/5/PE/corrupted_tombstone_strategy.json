    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The 'corrupted_tombstone_strategy' configuration does not involve any performance-related operations that are time-extensive or memory-extensive within its related code. The configuration is primarily used to determine how tombstones are validated on reads and compaction, and the impact of the configuration is limited to handling invalid tombstones. The code snippet provided does not show any operations that would cause notable performance variations at the system level. Therefore, the configuration is not considered performance-sensitive."
