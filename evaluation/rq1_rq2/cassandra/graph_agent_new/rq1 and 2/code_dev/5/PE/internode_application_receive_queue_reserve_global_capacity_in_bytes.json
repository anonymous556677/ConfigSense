{
    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'internode_application_receive_queue_reserve_global_capacity_in_bytes' is classified as performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly impacts the global limit on the size of messages queued for delivery and processing within the cluster, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The code context provided also indicates that this configuration involves scheduling tasks for monitoring unused connections, which can be time-expensive and memory-expensive operations contributing to system performance. Therefore, the configuration has the potential to significantly affect system performance and is considered performance-sensitive."
