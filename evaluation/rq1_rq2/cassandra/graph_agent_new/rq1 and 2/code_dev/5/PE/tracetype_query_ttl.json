    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'tracetype_query_ttl' is performance-sensitive. This is because the TTL value fetched from the 'TTLS' array directly impacts the retention period of trace data, affecting memory consumption and potentially storage requirements. The 'newSession' method calls trigger this configuration based on the TraceType, leading to notable performance variations at the system level due to the potential increase or decrease in storage and memory usage."
