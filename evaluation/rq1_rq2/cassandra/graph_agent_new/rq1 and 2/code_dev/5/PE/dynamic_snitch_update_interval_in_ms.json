    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'dynamic_snitch_update_interval_in_ms' configuration is performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly impacts the frequency of host score calculation, which is a time-expensive operation. The code context shows that the 'dynamicUpdateInterval' value controls how often the update and reset tasks are scheduled, affecting system performance at the system level. Changing this interval can lead to notable performance variations by either increasing system overhead with more frequent updates or potentially causing outdated scores with less frequent updates."
