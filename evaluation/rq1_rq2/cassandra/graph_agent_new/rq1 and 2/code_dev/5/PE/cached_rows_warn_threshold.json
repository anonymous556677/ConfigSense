    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'cached_rows_warn_threshold' is performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly affects the system performance by limiting the number of rows that can be materialized on-heap during queries. The code context shows that the configuration is used in the ReplicaFilteringProtection class to set a threshold for warning logging based on the number of rows from replicas. Exceeding this threshold can lead to performance variations at the system level, indicating that the configuration has a notable impact on performance."
