These limits are applied to the on-wire size of the message being sent or received.  The basic per-link limit is consumed in isolation before any endpoint or global limit is imposed. Each node-pair has three links: urgent, small and large.  So any given node may have a maximum of N*3*(internode_application_send_queue_capacity_in_bytes+internode_application_receive_queue_capacity_in_bytes) messages queued without any coordination between them although in practice, with token-aware routing, only RF*tokens nodes should need to communicate with significant bandwidth.  The per-endpoint limit is imposed on all messages exceeding the per-link limit, simultaneously with the global limit, on all links to or from a single node in the cluster. The global limit is imposed on all messages exceeding the per-link limit, simultaneously with the per-endpoint limit, on all links to or from any node in the cluster. ",
    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The configuration option 'internode_application_send_queue_capacity_in_bytes' is a method that returns the value of the send queue capacity in bytes. It checks if the value is not null, then returns the value, otherwise it gets the value from the DatabaseDescriptor.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The configuration is triggered whenever the application needs to send messages to other nodes in the cluster. The frequency of triggering depends on the volume of messages being sent and the size of the send queue capacity.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The 'internode_application_send_queue_capacity_in_bytes' configuration option impacts the system by setting limits on the amount of messages that can be queued for delivery to other nodes. It helps in managing the on-wire size of the messages being sent, and prevents overload by imposing limits on the queue capacity. This configuration option ensures efficient communication between nodes in the cluster and helps in maintaining system performance."
