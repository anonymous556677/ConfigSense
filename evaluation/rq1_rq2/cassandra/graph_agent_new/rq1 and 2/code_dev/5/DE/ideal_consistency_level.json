    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The configuration 'ideal_consistency_level' in the code is used to track whether replication achieved the ideal consistency level for writes without timing out. It compares the ideal consistency level with the consistency level requested by each write to determine if the ideal consistency level was achieved.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The configuration is triggered whenever a write operation is performed in the system. The triggering frequency depends on the number of write operations and the consistency levels requested by each write.",

This can potentially impact the performance of the system, especially under high write loads."
