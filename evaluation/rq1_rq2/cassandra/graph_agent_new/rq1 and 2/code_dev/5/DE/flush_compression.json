As high ratio compressors like LZ4HC, Zstd, and Deflate can potentially block flushes for too long, the default is to flush with a known fast compressor in those cases. Options are:  none : Flush without compressing blocks but while still doing checksums. fast : Flush with a fast compressor. If the table is already using a fast compressor that compressor is used. table: Always flush with the same compressor that the table uses. This was the pre 4.0 behavior. ",
    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The 'flush_compression' configuration is used in the code to determine the compression parameters for SSTables when they are flushed. Depending on the operation type (in this case, 'FLUSH'), a specific compression algorithm is selected based on the value of 'DatabaseDescriptor.getFlushCompression()'. The configuration option dictates which compression algorithm to use during the flushing process.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The triggering frequency of the 'flush_compression' configuration depends on how often SSTables need to be flushed in the system. If there are frequent flush operations, the configuration will be triggered more often to determine the compression algorithm to use during the flushing process.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the 'flush_compression' configuration option on the system is significant, especially for large tables. Choosing the right compression algorithm can affect the throughput of the system during flush operations. High ratio compressors like LZ4HC, Zstd, and Deflate can potentially block flushes for too long, so the default behavior is to use a fast compressor in those cases to prevent performance degradation."
