    "config_description": "GC Pauses greater than gc_warn_threshold_in_ms will be logged at WARN level Adjust the threshold based on your application throughput requirement. Setting to 0 will deactivate the feature.",
    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The configuration 'gc_warn_threshold_in_ms' is used to set a threshold for garbage collection pauses. If the garbage collection pause exceeds this threshold, a warning log will be generated. This allows developers to monitor and adjust the threshold based on application throughput requirements.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The configuration is triggered whenever a garbage collection pause occurs and exceeds the set threshold value. The frequency of triggering depends on the frequency and duration of garbage collection pauses in the system.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the 'gc_warn_threshold_in_ms' configuration option is on the system's performance monitoring and logging. Setting a higher threshold may result in fewer warning logs being generated, while setting a lower threshold may lead to more frequent warnings. Developers need to balance the threshold value based on the application's performance requirements and monitoring needs."
