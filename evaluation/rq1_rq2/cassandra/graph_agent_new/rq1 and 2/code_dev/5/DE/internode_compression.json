    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The configuration 'internode_compression' is used in the shouldCompressConnection method to determine whether the connection between nodes should be compressed. It checks if the internodeCompression setting in the DatabaseDescriptor is set to 'all' or 'dc' and if the connection is not within the local datacenter.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The triggering frequency of the 'internode_compression' configuration depends on the number of inter-node communications happening in the system. If there are frequent communications between nodes, this configuration will be triggered more often.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the 'internode_compression' configuration on the system can be significant in terms of network bandwidth usage and CPU utilization. If set to 'all', it will compress all traffic between nodes, which can reduce network bandwidth usage but increase CPU utilization. If set to 'dc', it will only compress traffic between different datacenters, which can still provide some bandwidth savings without as much CPU overhead."
