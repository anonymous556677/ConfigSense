    "config_description": "Throttles all streaming file transfer between the datacenters, this setting allows users to throttle inter dc stream throughput in addition to throttling all network stream traffic as configured with stream_throughput_outbound_megabits_per_sec When unset, the default is 200 Mbps or 25 MB/s",
    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The configuration 'inter_dc_stream_throughput_outbound_megabits_per_sec' is used to throttle all streaming file transfer between the datacenters. It allows users to throttle inter dc stream throughput in addition to throttling all network stream traffic as configured with 'stream_throughput_outbound_megabits_per_sec'. The configuration value is set and retrieved using the methods setInterDCStreamThroughputMbPerSec and getInterDCStreamThroughputMbPerSec respectively. The method calculateInterDCRateInBytes calculates the inter DC rate in bytes based on the configuration value.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The configuration is triggered whenever the setInterDCStreamThroughputMbPerSec method is called to set a new value for the inter DC stream throughput. The frequency of triggering depends on how often this method is called in the system.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the configuration option is significant as it directly affects the throttling of streaming file transfer between datacenters. Setting a lower value for the configuration will limit the inter DC stream throughput, potentially impacting the speed of data transfer between datacenters. On the other hand, setting a higher value can increase the throughput but may also lead to resource contention and potential performance issues."
