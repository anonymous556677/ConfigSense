    "config_description": "Per sstable indexed key cache entries (the collation index in memory mentioned above) exceeding this size will not be held on heap. This means that only partition information is held on heap and the index entries are read from disk.  Note that this size refers to the size of the serialized index information and not the size of the partition.",
    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The configuration 'column_index_cache_size_in_kb' determines the size limit for holding sstable indexed key cache entries in memory. Entries exceeding this size will not be held on heap, meaning only partition information is held on heap and index entries are read from disk.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The configuration is triggered whenever the getColumnIndexCacheSize() method is called in the code.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the 'column_index_cache_size_in_kb' configuration option is that it affects the amount of memory used for holding index entries in memory. Setting a higher value may increase memory usage but improve performance by keeping more index entries in memory, while setting a lower value may reduce memory usage but increase disk reads for index entries."
