    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The 'periodic_commitlog_sync_lag_block_in_ms' configuration is used in the PeriodicCommitLogService class to determine the amount of time to block writes while waiting for a slow disk flush to complete. It calculates the expected sync time based on the current system time and the configured block time in milliseconds.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The triggering frequency of the 'periodic_commitlog_sync_lag_block_in_ms' configuration depends on the system's performance and the frequency of disk flushes. It is triggered whenever a slow disk flush is detected and the system needs to wait for it to complete before continuing with the writes.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the 'periodic_commitlog_sync_lag_block_in_ms' configuration option on the system is that it can potentially slow down write operations if the configured block time is too high. This can lead to increased latency in write operations, especially when dealing with slow disk flushes."
