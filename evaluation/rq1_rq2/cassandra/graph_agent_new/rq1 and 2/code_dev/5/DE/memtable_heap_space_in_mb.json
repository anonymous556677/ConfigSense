    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The configuration 'memtable_heap_space_in_mb' is used to set the total permitted memory to use for memtables in Cassandra. The code snippet provided shows that the value of 'memtable_heap_space_in_mb' is fetched from the DatabaseDescriptor and used to calculate the heapLimit and offHeapLimit for the MemtablePool.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The triggering frequency of the 'memtable_heap_space_in_mb' configuration depends on the memtable_cleanup_threshold value set in the DatabaseDescriptor. When the total memory used by memtables exceeds the limit specified by 'memtable_heap_space_in_mb', Cassandra will stop accepting writes until a flush completes. The frequency of triggering a flush is determined by the memtable_cleanup_threshold.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the 'memtable_heap_space_in_mb' configuration option on the system is significant. If the configured memory limit is too low, it can lead to frequent flushes and potentially impact the performance of the system. On the other hand, setting a higher memory limit can help in handling more data in memory but may also increase the risk of running out of memory. It is crucial to tune this configuration based on the workload and available resources to optimize system performance."
