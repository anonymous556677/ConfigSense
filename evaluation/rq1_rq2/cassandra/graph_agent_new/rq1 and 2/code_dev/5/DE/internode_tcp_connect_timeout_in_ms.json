    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The configuration 'internode_tcp_connect_timeout_in_ms' is used to set the amount of time to wait for internode TCP connections to establish in Cassandra. The code snippet provided shows that the method tcpConnectTimeoutInMS() returns the value of 'tcpConnectTimeoutInMS' if it is not null, otherwise it calls getInternodeTcpConnectTimeoutInMS() method from DatabaseDescriptor class.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The triggering frequency of the 'internode_tcp_connect_timeout_in_ms' configuration depends on the network conditions and the frequency of internode TCP connections establishment in the Cassandra cluster. It is typically triggered when nodes in the cluster need to establish TCP connections with each other.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the 'internode_tcp_connect_timeout_in_ms' configuration option on the system is related to the stability and performance of internode communication in the Cassandra cluster. Setting a higher timeout value may lead to longer wait times for TCP connections to establish, potentially impacting the overall responsiveness and reliability of the system. On the other hand, setting a lower timeout value may increase the risk of network partitions and communication failures."
