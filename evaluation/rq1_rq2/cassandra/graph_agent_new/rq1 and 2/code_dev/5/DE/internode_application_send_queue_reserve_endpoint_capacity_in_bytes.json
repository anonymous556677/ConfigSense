    "config_description": "Global, per-endpoint and per-connection limits imposed on messages queued for delivery to other nodes and waiting to be processed on arrival from other nodes in the cluster.  These limits are applied to the on-wire size of the message being sent or received.  The basic per-link limit is consumed in isolation before any endpoint or global limit is imposed. Each node-pair has three links: urgent, small and large.  So any given node may have a maximum of N*3*(internode_application_send_queue_capacity_in_bytes+internode_application_receive_queue_capacity_in_bytes) messages queued without any coordination between them although in practice, with token-aware routing, only RF*tokens nodes should need to communicate with significant bandwidth.  The per-endpoint limit is imposed on all messages exceeding the per-link limit, simultaneously with the global limit, on all links to or from a single node in the cluster. The global limit is imposed on all messages exceeding the per-link limit, simultaneously with the per-endpoint limit, on all links to or from any node in the cluster.  internode_application_send_queue_capacity_in_bytes: 4194304                       #4MiB",
    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The configuration code 'internode_application_send_queue_reserve_endpoint_capacity_in_bytes' is used to set default reserve limits for outbound connections. It retrieves the values for endpoint capacity and global capacity, and if they are null, it assigns default values from the DatabaseDescriptor and MessagingService respectively. It then returns the updated settings with the application reserve send queue capacity in bytes.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The triggering frequency of the 'internode_application_send_queue_reserve_endpoint_capacity_in_bytes' configuration depends on when the 'withDefaultReserveLimits' method is called in the code. This could vary based on the application logic and usage patterns.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The 'internode_application_send_queue_reserve_endpoint_capacity_in_bytes' configuration impacts the system by setting limits on the size of messages queued for delivery to other nodes and waiting to be processed on arrival. It imposes limits on the on-wire size of the message being sent or received, with per-endpoint and global limits. This helps in managing the message queue size and ensuring efficient communication within the cluster."
