In the provided code snippet, the value of 'maxHintsFileSize' is retrieved from 'DatabaseDescriptor.getMaxHintsFileSize()' and is used to check the size of the hints file during the writing process.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The triggering frequency of the 'max_hints_file_size_in_mb' configuration depends on the size of the hints file being written. Whenever a new hints file is being written, the code checks if the size of the file exceeds the configured maximum size limit specified by 'max_hints_file_size_in_mb'. If the size limit is reached, the writing process is stopped.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the 'max_hints_file_size_in_mb' configuration option on the system is that it helps in controlling the size of individual hints files. By setting a maximum size limit, it ensures that hints files do not grow too large, which can help in managing disk space usage and preventing potential performance issues related to handling large files."
