If disabled, replicas will assume that requests were forwarded to them instantly by the coordinator, which means that under overload conditions we will waste that much extra time processing already-timed-out requests.  Warning: It is generally assumed that users have setup NTP on their clusters, and that clocks are modestly in sync, since this is a requirement for general correctness of last write wins.",
    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The configuration 'cross_node_timeout' is checked in the method getExpiresAtNanos to determine if operation timeout information exchange between nodes should be enabled. If the DatabaseDescriptor does not have cross node timeout enabled or if the createdAtNanos is greater than the currentTimeNanos, the createdAtNanos is set to the currentTimeNanos. The method then calculates and returns the expiration time in nanoseconds.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The triggering frequency of the 'cross_node_timeout' configuration depends on the frequency of calls to the getExpiresAtNanos method in the system. The configuration is checked each time the method is called, which could vary based on the application's usage.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "Enabling the 'cross_node_timeout' configuration allows for accurate measurement of request timeouts between nodes. If disabled, replicas will assume that requests were forwarded instantly by the coordinator, potentially leading to wasted processing time for already-timed-out requests under overload conditions. It is important to note that this configuration assumes that users have NTP setup on their clusters and that clocks are in sync for general correctness of last write wins."
