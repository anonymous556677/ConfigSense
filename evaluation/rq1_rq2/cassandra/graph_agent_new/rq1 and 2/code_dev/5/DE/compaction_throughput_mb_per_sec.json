The faster you insert data, the faster you need to compact in order to keep the sstable count down, but in general, setting this to 16 to 32 times the rate you are inserting data is more than sufficient. Setting this to 0 disables throttling. Note that this accounts for all types of compaction, including validation compaction (building Merkle trees for repairs).",

    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the 'compaction_throughput_mb_per_sec' configuration option is significant as it directly affects the speed and efficiency of the compaction process. Setting it too low may result in slower compaction and potential backlog, while setting it too high may consume excessive system resources. It is recommended to set it to a value that is 16 to 32 times the rate of data insertion for optimal performance."
