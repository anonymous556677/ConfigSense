This configuration setting is used to throttle the number of links created or removed during the process of creating or clearing a snapshot. By setting a non-zero value for snapshot_links_per_second, the performance impact on consumer grade SSDs can be mitigated by limiting the rate at which these links are processed."

The getSnapshotRateLimiter method returns a RateLimiter object created with the value obtained from getSnapshotLinksPerSecond method.",

Setting a non-zero value can throttle the creation or clearing of snapshot links, which helps in avoiding negative performance impact, especially on consumer grade SSDs."
