If the node does not receive a keep-alive message from the peer for 2 keep-alive cycles the stream session times out and fail Default value is 300s (5 minutes), which means stalled stream times out in 10 minutes by default",
    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The configuration 'streaming_keep_alive_period_in_secs' is used to set the keep-alive period for streaming. This means that the node will send a keep-alive message periodically with the specified period to maintain the connection with the peer.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The configuration is triggered whenever a keep-alive task is scheduled in the system. The keep-alive task is scheduled at a fixed rate based on the value of 'streaming_keep_alive_period_in_secs'.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the 'streaming_keep_alive_period_in_secs' configuration option is that it determines how frequently keep-alive messages are sent between nodes. A shorter period may result in more frequent communication between nodes, while a longer period may reduce the frequency of keep-alive messages exchanged. This can affect the overall performance and stability of the streaming sessions in the system."
