If space gets above this value, Cassandra will throw WriteTimeoutException on Mutations including tables with CDC enabled.

The default value is the min of 4096 mb and 1/8th of the total space of the drive where cdc_raw_directory resides.",

It retrieves the value set for CDC space in MB from the DatabaseDescriptor and converts it to bytes by multiplying with 1024*1024.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The triggering frequency of the 'cdc_total_space_in_mb' configuration depends on the usage of change-data-capture logs and the rate at which data is being written to the tables with CDC enabled. If the space allocated for CDC logs exceeds the specified value, Cassandra will throw WriteTimeoutException on Mutations.",

If the allocated space is insufficient, it can lead to WriteTimeoutExceptions on Mutations, potentially impacting the performance and reliability of the system."
