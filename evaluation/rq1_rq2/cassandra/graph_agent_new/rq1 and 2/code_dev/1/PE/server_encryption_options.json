    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'server_encryption_options' configuration is performance-sensitive. The configuration involves setting up SSL contexts, creating SSL certificates, and managing encryption options for server connections. These operations are time-expensive and memory-expensive, impacting the system's performance significantly. The configuration directly affects system performance at the system level by enforcing encryption policies and managing truststores and keystores, leading to notable performance variations."
