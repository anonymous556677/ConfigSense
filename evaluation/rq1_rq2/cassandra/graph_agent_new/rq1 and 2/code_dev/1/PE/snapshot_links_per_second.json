    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'snapshot_links_per_second' is performance-sensitive. The code context shows that this configuration is directly used to create a RateLimiter object, which indicates that it involves time-expensive operations. Additionally, the developer's information states that this configuration is used to throttle the creation or clearing of snapshot links to avoid negative performance impact on consumer grade SSDs. This shows that the configuration directly and substantially affects system performance at the system level by managing the performance impact of snapshot operations. Therefore, the configuration is considered performance-sensitive."
