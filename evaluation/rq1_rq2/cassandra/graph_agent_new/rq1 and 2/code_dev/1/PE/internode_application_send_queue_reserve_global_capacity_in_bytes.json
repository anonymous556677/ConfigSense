    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'internode_application_send_queue_reserve_global_capacity_in_bytes' is classified as performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly impacts the queuing and processing of messages between nodes in the cluster, which are time-expensive operations. The setting of a higher or lower capacity limit can significantly affect message delivery performance at the system level. The code context provided does not show the direct implementation of this configuration, but the developer's explanation indicates that it involves performance-related operations that can lead to notable performance variations in the system."
