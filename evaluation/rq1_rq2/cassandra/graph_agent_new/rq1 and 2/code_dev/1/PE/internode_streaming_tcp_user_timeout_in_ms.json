    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'internode_streaming_tcp_user_timeout_in_ms' is performance-sensitive because it directly affects the processing time of incoming stream messages at the system level. The code snippet related to this configuration performs time-expensive operations by comparing the processing time with the configured timeout value. If the processing time exceeds the timeout value, a warning is logged, indicating a potential impact on system performance. Therefore, this configuration can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, making it performance-sensitive."
