    "classification_result": "Performance-insensitive with 100% confidence",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'Row cache implementation class name' is related to the type of row cache implementation in Cassandra.

It is simply a choice of implementation and does not involve performance-related operations or affect system performance."
