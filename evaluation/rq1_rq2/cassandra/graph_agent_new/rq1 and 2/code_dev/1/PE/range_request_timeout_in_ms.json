    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'range_request_timeout_in_ms' configuration is performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly affects the maximum time allowed for range requests or index scans to complete, which can have a significant impact on system performance. The code context shows that the configuration is used in methods like 'getRangeRpcTimeout' which are time-expensive operations. Additionally, the configuration involves setting timeouts for critical operations, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
