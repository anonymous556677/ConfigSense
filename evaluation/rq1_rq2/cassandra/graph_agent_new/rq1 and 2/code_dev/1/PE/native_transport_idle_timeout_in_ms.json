    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'native_transport_idle_timeout_in_ms' configuration is performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly affects system performance by managing and closing idle client connections, which can have a significant impact on resource utilization and overall system efficiency. The code snippet provided shows that the configuration sets an idle timeout for client connections and closes them after a specified period of inactivity. This operation is time-expensive as it involves monitoring and handling idle connections, which can impact system performance at the system level. Therefore, the configuration is considered performance-sensitive based on its direct and substantial effect on system performance."
