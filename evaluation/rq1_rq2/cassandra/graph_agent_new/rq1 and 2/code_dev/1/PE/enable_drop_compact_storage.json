    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'enable_drop_compact_storage' is classified as performance-sensitive. This is because the code context shows that the configuration directly impacts the behavior of the system by allowing or disallowing the dropping of compact storage on tables. This operation can have significant performance implications on storage efficiency and data access patterns, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Additionally, the triggering frequency of this configuration depends on when the 'ALTER ... DROP COMPACT STORAGE' statement is executed, indicating its direct impact on system performance."
