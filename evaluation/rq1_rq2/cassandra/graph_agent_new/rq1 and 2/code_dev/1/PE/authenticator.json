    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The 'authenticator' configuration option is not performance-sensitive. The configuration is primarily focused on authentication and access control, which does not involve time-expensive or memory-expensive operations that would lead to notable performance variations at the system level. While the configuration impacts security and access control, it does not directly and substantially affect system performance in terms of performance-related operations."
