    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'internode_application_send_queue_capacity_in_bytes' is performance-sensitive. This is because the code context involves retrieving the application send queue capacity in bytes, which directly impacts the size of messages queued for delivery to other nodes. Managing the flow of messages and preventing overwhelming the system with a large number of queued messages is crucial for system performance. Setting this configuration too low may result in message loss or delays, while setting it too high may consume excessive memory and network resources. Therefore, the configuration involves performance-related operations that are memory-expensive and can lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
