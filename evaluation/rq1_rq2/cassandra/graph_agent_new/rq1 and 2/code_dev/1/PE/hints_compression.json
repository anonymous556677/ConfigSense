    "Reason": "The 'hints_compression' configuration option is not performance-sensitive. The code snippet provided shows that this configuration is primarily focused on specifying the compression to apply to hint files. While choosing a more efficient compressor can lead to potential storage savings and improved performance in reading and writing hint files, the configuration itself does not involve any performance-related operations that are time-expensive or memory-expensive. Therefore, it does not directly and substantially affect system performance at the system level, making it not performance-sensitive."
