    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'memtable_heap_space_in_mb' configuration is performance-sensitive. The code snippet provided shows that this configuration directly influences the heapLimit and offHeapLimit for memtable allocation pools, which are critical for memory management in the Cassandra database. The size impact of this configuration on the system is significant, as it determines the total permitted memory for memtables. Setting this limit too low can lead to frequent flushes and impact system performance, while setting it too high can increase memory usage. Additionally, the triggering frequency of this configuration, based on the memtable_cleanup_threshold, can directly affect system performance by determining when flushes occur. Therefore, the 'memtable_heap_space_in_mb' configuration involves performance-related operations that have a notable impact on system performance at the system level."
