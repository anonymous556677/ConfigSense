    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'truncate_request_timeout_in_ms' is classified as performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly affects the timeout duration for truncate operations to complete, which can have a significant impact on system performance. The code context shows that the configuration is used to set a timeout for truncates, and if the timeout is too short, it can lead to truncates timing out prematurely, affecting system performance. Therefore, the configuration involves time-expensive operations that directly impact system performance at the system level."
