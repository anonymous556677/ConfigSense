    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'file_cache_enabled' configuration is performance-sensitive. This is because enabling this configuration directly impacts the system's performance by caching frequently accessed data chunks in memory, reducing disk reads and improving read latency and overall system throughput. The code context reveals that the configuration involves time-expensive operations such as loading buffers into memory, managing cache size, and handling cache invalidation. These operations directly affect the system's performance at the system level by optimizing data access and reducing I/O operations. Therefore, the configuration is considered performance-sensitive based on its significant impact on system performance."
