    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'slow_query_log_timeout_in_ms' configuration is classified as performance-sensitive because it directly affects system performance by monitoring and identifying slow queries based on the specified timeout value. The code context shows that the configuration is used to set a monitoring time for queries and generate aggregated log messages for slow queries. This monitoring process involves time-expensive operations such as measuring query execution time and determining if a query exceeds the timeout value. These operations contribute significantly to system performance variations at the system level, making the configuration performance-sensitive."
