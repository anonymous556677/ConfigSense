    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'enable_materialized_views' is performance-sensitive because it directly affects the system performance at the system level. Enabling materialized views can lead to the creation of views that may have significant performance impacts depending on their usage and implementation. The code related to this configuration involves multiple operations that contribute to execution time and memory consumption, such as validations, processing SELECT and WHERE clauses, and building the materialized view. These operations can be time-expensive and memory-expensive, leading to notable performance variations at the system level. Therefore, the configuration is considered performance-sensitive."
