{
    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'cdc_free_space_check_interval_ms' is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the configuration directly impacts the system's performance by managing the space usage for cdc-tracked tables. The code related to this configuration involves time-expensive operations like periodic size calculations and checks for available space, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Additionally, the configuration triggers these performance-related operations at a frequency of 250ms, indicating its significance in monitoring and maintaining optimal performance of the CDC subsystem."
