    "classification_result": "Performance-insensitive with 100% confidence",
    "Reason": "The internode_compression configuration option only controls whether traffic between nodes is compressed, which does not directly impact system performance. The choice of compression level does not involve any performance-related operations or affect system performance, making it performance-insensitive."
