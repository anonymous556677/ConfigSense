    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'cas_contention_timeout_in_ms' is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the retry behavior of CAS operations, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The code context shows that the timeout value is crucial in determining how long the coordinator retries CAS operations when contention occurs. A lower timeout value can result in more contention and potentially higher performance impact, while a higher timeout value can reduce contention but may increase operation latency. Therefore, the configuration involves performance-related operations that are time-expensive and memory-expensive, making it performance-sensitive."
