    "Reason": "The 'index_summary_capacity_in_mb' configuration is performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly impacts the memory usage of SSTable index summaries, which can have a significant effect on system performance. The code snippet provided shows that the configuration is used to set the memory pool size for the index summary manager, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Additionally, the developer's explanation highlights that exceeding the memory limit specified by this configuration can result in memory usage issues, further emphasizing its performance sensitivity."
