    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The 'tombstone_failure_threshold' configuration is not performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration is used to set a threshold for tombstone failures, which does not directly involve time-expensive or memory-expensive operations that lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The configuration is more focused on handling specific scenarios related to tombstone failures rather than impacting overall system performance significantly."
