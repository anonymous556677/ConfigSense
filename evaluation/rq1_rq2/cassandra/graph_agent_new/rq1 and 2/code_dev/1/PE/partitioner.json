    "classification_result": "Performance-insensitive with 100% confidence",
    "Reason": "The partitioner configuration option is performance-insensitive because it is responsible for distributing rows across nodes in the cluster based on the partition key. Changing the partitioner does not directly impact system performance, and it is recommended to keep the default Murmur3Partitioner for new clusters. Additionally, the configuration description mentions that older partitioners are included for backward compatibility only, further supporting the classification of performance insignificance."
