    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'key_cache_size_in_mb' configuration is classified as performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly impacts the size of the key cache in memory, which can significantly affect system performance. The code snippet provided shows that the size of the key cache is calculated based on this configuration, and a larger cache size can lead to improved performance by reducing cache misses. However, it also mentions that a larger cache size consumes more memory, which can impact overall system performance. Therefore, the configuration involves performance-related operations that are memory-expensive and can lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
