    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'cached_rows_warn_threshold' configuration is performance-sensitive. This is because it directly impacts the system performance by setting a threshold for the number of rows from replicas that materialize on-heap during index and filtering queries. If this threshold is breached, a warning will be logged, indicating potential issues with replica synchronization or query size. The configuration involves performance-related operations that are memory-expensive, as it limits the amount of data that can be loaded into memory during queries, which can significantly affect the overall system performance."
