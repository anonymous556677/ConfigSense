    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'enable_sasi_indexes' configuration option is performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly affects the creation of SASI indexes, which can have a notable impact on system performance. The code snippet provided checks if SASI indexes are enabled and throws an exception if they are not, indicating that enabling SASI indexes can lead to performance improvements in query processing. Additionally, the developer's understanding mentions that enabling SASI indexes may impact system performance and stability, further supporting the classification of the configuration as performance-sensitive."
