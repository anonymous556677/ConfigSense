    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'file_cache_size_in_mb' configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the memory allocation for sstable chunk cache and buffer pooling in the system. The calculation of the cache size based on 'DatabaseDescriptor.getFileCacheSizeInMB()' can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The configuration involves memory-expensive operations that significantly affect system performance by determining the amount of memory used for caching and buffering, which can have a direct impact on overall system performance."
