    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The audit_logging_options configuration is performance-sensitive. This is because enabling audit logging with this configuration can have a significant impact on system performance and storage. The code snippets related to this configuration involve operations that can be time-expensive and memory-expensive, such as logging every incoming CQL command request and authentication. These operations can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, making the configuration performance-sensitive."
