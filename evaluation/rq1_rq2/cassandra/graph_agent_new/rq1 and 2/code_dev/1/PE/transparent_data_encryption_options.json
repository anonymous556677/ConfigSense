    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'transparent_data_encryption_options' configuration is performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration involves encryption and decryption operations for data at-rest on disk, which are time-expensive operations. The code context provided includes methods for handling encryption, decryption, and creating encryption components, all of which contribute to notable performance variations at the system level. Additionally, the developer's understanding mentions that the configuration impacts performance slightly due to the encryption and decryption processes, further supporting the classification of the configuration as performance-sensitive."
