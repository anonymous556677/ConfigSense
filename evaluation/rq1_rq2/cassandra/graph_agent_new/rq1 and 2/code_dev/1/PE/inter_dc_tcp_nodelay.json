{
    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'inter_dc_tcp_nodelay' configuration is classified as performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly affects the network performance and latency for cross-datacenter communication at the system level. The code snippet provided shows that the configuration influences the size of network packets being sent, which can have a significant impact on performance. Additionally, the 'tcpNoDelay' method is called based on the frequency of inter-dc communication and configuration changes, indicating that it plays a crucial role in system performance. Therefore, the configuration is considered performance-sensitive due to its direct and substantial impact on system performance."
