    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The 'tracetype_query_ttl' configuration option is not performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration is primarily used to define the TTL for different trace types during the logging of the repair process. While it may impact storage size, it does not directly and substantially affect system performance at the system level. The code related to this configuration mainly deals with setting and getting TTL values for different trace types, which does not involve time-expensive or memory-expensive operations that would lead to notable performance variations."
