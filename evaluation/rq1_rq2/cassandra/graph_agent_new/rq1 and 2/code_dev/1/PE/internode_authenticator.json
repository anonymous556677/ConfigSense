    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The 'internode_authenticator' configuration option is not performance-sensitive based on the provided code context and developer information. Although the configuration directly impacts the security and authentication mechanism for connections between peer nodes, it does not involve any performance-related operations that are time-expensive or memory-expensive. The configuration setting is more focused on security functionality rather than performance optimization, and it does not lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
