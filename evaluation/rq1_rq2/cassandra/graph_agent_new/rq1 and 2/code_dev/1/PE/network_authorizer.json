    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'network_authorizer' configuration is performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly affects the security and access control of the system at the system level. The code related to the 'network_authorizer' configuration involves operations that check user permissions to access data centers, which can be time-expensive and memory-expensive. Additionally, the configuration involves network authorization checks that can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, making it a performance-sensitive configuration."
