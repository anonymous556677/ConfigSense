    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The 'disk_failure_policy' configuration does not involve any performance-sensitive operations that significantly impact system performance at the system level. The configuration mainly determines the behavior of the system when encountering disk failures, such as stopping transports or marking disks as unwritable. These operations, although important for system reliability, do not directly contribute to notable performance variations in terms of execution time or memory consumption. Therefore, the configuration is not classified as performance-sensitive."
