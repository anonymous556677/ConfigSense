    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'allocate_tokens_for_keyspace' configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the token allocation strategy for new nodes joining the cluster, which in turn affects the distribution of data across the cluster. This configuration involves performance-related operations such as generating suitable tokens based on the allocationKeyspace or choosing num_tokens at random, which can have a notable performance impact at the system level. The code context also shows that the configuration handles different scenarios based on the presence of initial tokens or allocationKeyspace, indicating that it plays a crucial role in the performance of the system."
