    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'sstable_preemptive_open_interval_in_mb' is performance-sensitive. This is because the calculation of the interval in the 'calculateOpenInterval' method directly impacts the performance of the system by determining how SSTables are preemptively opened. The configuration involves time-expensive operations, such as multiplication and conditional checks, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Additionally, the developer's explanation highlights the importance of this configuration in optimizing compaction operations and improving overall system performance, further emphasizing its performance sensitivity."
