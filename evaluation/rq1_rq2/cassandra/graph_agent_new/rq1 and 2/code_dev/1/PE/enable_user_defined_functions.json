    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'enable_user_defined_functions' is performance-sensitive. This is because the code snippet checks if the configuration is enabled before proceeding with certain operations. If user-defined functions are disabled, it can impact the system's performance by preventing the execution of certain code paths. Enabling user-defined functions can also introduce security risks, which can further impact system performance. Therefore, the configuration directly and substantially affects system performance at the system level, making it performance-sensitive."
