    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'repair_session_space_in_mb' configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the memory usage during repair operations at the system level. The code context shows that this configuration is used to calculate the available bytes for the repair session space based on the configured value and the replication factor of the keyspace. The calculation of 'availableBytes' in the code snippet is directly influenced by the 'repair_session_space_in_mb' configuration, and any changes to this configuration can lead to notable performance variations in terms of memory consumption during repair operations. Therefore, the configuration involves performance-related operations that are memory-expensive and contribute significantly to system performance, making it performance-sensitive."
