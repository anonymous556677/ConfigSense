    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'native_transport_max_threads' configuration is performance-sensitive. This is because it directly impacts the maximum number of threads used for handling requests in the native transport, which can significantly affect system performance. The code snippet shows that this configuration is used to initialize the 'requestExecutor' LocalAwareExecutorService, which is crucial for processing requests efficiently. Any changes to this configuration can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, affecting response times and system resource utilization."
