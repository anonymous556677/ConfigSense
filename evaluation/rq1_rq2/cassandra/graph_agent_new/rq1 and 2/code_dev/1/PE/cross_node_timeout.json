    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'cross_node_timeout' configuration is performance-sensitive. The code context shows that this configuration directly impacts the calculation of expiration time in nanoseconds, which is a time-expensive operation. The configuration check in the code also indicates that it affects the behavior of operation timeout information exchange between nodes, which can have a notable performance impact at the system level. Additionally, the developer's explanation highlights the significance of this configuration for accurately measuring request timeouts between nodes and the potential consequences of not having it enabled, further emphasizing its performance sensitivity."
