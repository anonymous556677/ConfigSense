    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'native_transport_max_frame_size_in_mb' is performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly affects the maximum size of frames that can be processed by the system. Changing this configuration can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, as it impacts memory usage and processing time. The code context shows that the configuration is crucial for handling frame sizes and rejecting oversized frames, which are time-expensive and memory-expensive operations. Therefore, any changes to this configuration can have a significant impact on system performance."
