    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'num_tokens' configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly affects the distribution of data across nodes in the ring, which can lead to uneven data distribution and potentially impact performance at the system level. The code related to 'num_tokens' involves operations that determine the number of tokens assigned to the node, affecting the proportion of data stored by the node. This can have a notable performance variation, especially in scenarios where the number of tokens is changed, leading to potential data imbalance and performance issues."
