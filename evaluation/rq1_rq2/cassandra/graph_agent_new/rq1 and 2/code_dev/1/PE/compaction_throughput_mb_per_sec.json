    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'compaction_throughput_mb_per_sec' is performance-sensitive. This is because it directly affects the rate at which compaction operations are performed in the system, leading to notable performance variations at the system level. The code context shows that this configuration is used to set the rate limit for compaction, which can have a significant impact on the execution time and memory consumption of compaction operations. Additionally, the developer's understanding of the configuration's size impact further confirms its performance sensitivity, as setting it too low or too high can result in performance implications at the system level."
