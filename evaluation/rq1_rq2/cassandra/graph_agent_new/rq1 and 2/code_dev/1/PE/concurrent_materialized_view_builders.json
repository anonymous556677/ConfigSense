    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'concurrent_materialized_view_builders' configuration is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the configuration directly affects the number of simultaneous materialized view builder tasks allowed in the system, which can impact system performance and resource utilization. The code context shows that this configuration is used to control the concurrency of view building tasks, which are time-expensive operations. Adjusting this configuration can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, making it performance-sensitive."
