    "Reason": "The configuration option 'full_query_logging_options' is performance-sensitive. The code context provided shows that enabling and customizing full query logging can have a significant impact on system performance. The 'enableFullQueryLogger' method allows for setting various parameters that directly affect the amount of data logged for each query, potentially leading to increased disk usage and additional logging overhead. This can result in notable performance variations at the system level, making the configuration performance-sensitive."
