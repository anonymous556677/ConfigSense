{
    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'streaming_keep_alive_period_in_secs' is classified as performance-sensitive. This is because the value of this configuration directly impacts the frequency of keep-alive messages being sent between nodes, which in turn affects the timeout behavior of stream sessions. The code context provided shows that the value of 'streaming_keep_alive_period_in_secs' is used to schedule keep-alive tasks at a fixed rate, indicating that it involves time-expensive operations. Additionally, the developer's understanding highlights the significant impact of this configuration on session timeouts, further emphasizing its performance sensitivity at the system level."
