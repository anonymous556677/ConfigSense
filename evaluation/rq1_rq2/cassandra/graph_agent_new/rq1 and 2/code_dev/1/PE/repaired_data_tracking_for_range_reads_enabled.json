    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'repaired_data_tracking_for_range_reads_enabled' is performance-sensitive. The code context shows that enabling this configuration adds overhead to range read operations by tracking repaired data for all range reads. This additional tracking involves performance-related operations that contribute to increased execution time and memory consumption. The developer's understanding also confirms that the configuration impacts system performance by introducing additional processing for tracking repaired data during range reads. Therefore, the configuration directly and substantially affects system performance at the system level, making it performance-sensitive."
