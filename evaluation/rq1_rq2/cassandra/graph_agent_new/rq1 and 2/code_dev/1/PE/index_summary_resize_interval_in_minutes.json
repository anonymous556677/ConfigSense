    "Reason": "The configuration option 'index_summary_resize_interval_in_minutes' does not directly involve any performance-related operations that are time-expensive or memory-expensive within its related code. The code snippet provided only shows the initialization of the IndexSummaryManager with the configuration value, but it does not contain any performance-sensitive operations. Additionally, the developer's explanation indicates that this configuration mainly affects how often index summaries are resampled, which does not have a substantial impact on system performance at the system level."
