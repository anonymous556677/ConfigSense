    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'role_manager' is not performance-sensitive. The code primarily deals with authentication, authorization, and role management operations, which are essential for security and access control. While these operations are critical for the system's functionality, they do not involve time-expensive or memory-expensive operations that would lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The code focuses on managing roles, permissions, and grants, which are necessary for security but do not directly impact system performance in a significant way."
