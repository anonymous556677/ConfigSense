    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'dynamic_snitch_reset_interval_in_ms' is performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly affects the frequency at which host scores are reset, which can have a significant impact on the performance of the system. The code snippet provided shows that the configuration is used to schedule tasks that reset host scores at a fixed interval. This operation is time-expensive and can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, making it performance-sensitive."
