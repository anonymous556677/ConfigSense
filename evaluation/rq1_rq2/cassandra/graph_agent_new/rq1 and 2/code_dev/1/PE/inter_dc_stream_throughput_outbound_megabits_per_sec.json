    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'inter_dc_stream_throughput_outbound_megabits_per_sec' is performance-sensitive. This is because it directly impacts the rate at which data is transferred between datacenters, which can have a significant effect on system performance. The code provided includes performance-related operations such as updating the inter DC throughput and calculating the inter DC rate in bytes based on this configuration. These operations are time-expensive and memory-expensive, leading to notable performance variations at the system level."
