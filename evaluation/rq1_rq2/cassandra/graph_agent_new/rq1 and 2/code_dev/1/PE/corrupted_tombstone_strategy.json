    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'corrupted_tombstone_strategy' is not performance-sensitive based on the code context provided. The configuration is used to determine how tombstones are validated on reads and compactions, and it does not involve any performance-related operations that are time-expensive or memory-expensive. The code mainly checks the strategy set in the configuration and handles invalid tombstones accordingly, which does not lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The configuration's impact is more focused on data validation and error handling rather than performance optimization."
