    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'commit_failure_policy' configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts system performance by determining how the system handles commit disk failures. The code context provided shows that different policies can lead to significant performance variations, such as shutting down nodes, killing JVMs, or continuing to service reads. These operations are time-expensive and memory-expensive, leading to notable performance variations at the system level. Therefore, the configuration is considered performance-sensitive."
