    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'internode_application_send_queue_reserve_endpoint_capacity_in_bytes' is classified as performance-sensitive. This is because the code context involves setting limits for outbound connections based on the provided or retrieved values, which can directly impact the system's performance. The configuration directly affects the message queue size and network traffic, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Additionally, setting a higher value for this configuration can potentially increase memory usage and network traffic, making it a performance-sensitive configuration."
