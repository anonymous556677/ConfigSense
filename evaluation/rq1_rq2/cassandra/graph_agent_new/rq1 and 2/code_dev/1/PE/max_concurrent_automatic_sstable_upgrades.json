    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'max_concurrent_automatic_sstable_upgrades' is performance-sensitive. This is because the code snippet provided shows that the configuration directly controls the maximum number of concurrent automatic sstable upgrades that can be triggered in the system. The comparison of the number of currently background upgrading tasks to the value specified by 'max_concurrent_automatic_sstable_upgrades' can lead to significant performance variations at the system level. If the value is too high, it could potentially overload the system with too many concurrent upgrades, impacting both execution time and memory consumption. Therefore, this configuration involves performance-related operations that are time-expensive and memory-expensive, making it performance-sensitive."
