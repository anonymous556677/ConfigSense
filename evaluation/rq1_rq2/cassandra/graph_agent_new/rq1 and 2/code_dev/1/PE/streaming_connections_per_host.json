    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'streaming_connections_per_host' configuration is performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly impacts the number of connections per host for streaming, which can have a notable performance variation at the system level. The code context shows that this configuration is used in critical streaming operations like bootstrap and rebuild processes, where the number of connections per host can significantly affect the overall performance of the system. Additionally, the developer's understanding of the configuration's impact on CPU-bound joins and network-bound performance further supports its classification as performance-sensitive."
