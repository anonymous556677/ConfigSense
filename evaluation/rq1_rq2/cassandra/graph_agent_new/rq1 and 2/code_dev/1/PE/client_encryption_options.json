    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'client_encryption_options' is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the configuration involves creating and caching SSL contexts, which are time-expensive and memory-expensive operations. The SSLFactory class initializes SSL certificates, validates SSL certs, and handles hot reloading of SSL certificates, all of which directly impact system performance at the system level. Additionally, the configuration code mentions that Netty SslContext instances are expensive to create and consume a lot of resources, especially direct memory, due to caching. Therefore, the configuration involves performance-related operations that lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
