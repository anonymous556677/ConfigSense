    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'tombstone_warn_threshold' is not performance-sensitive. The code related to this configuration involves getting the tombstone warning threshold value from the DatabaseDescriptor, which is a simple retrieval operation and does not involve any time-expensive or memory-expensive operations. This configuration does not directly and substantially affect system performance at the system level, and changing this threshold value is unlikely to cause notable performance variations."
