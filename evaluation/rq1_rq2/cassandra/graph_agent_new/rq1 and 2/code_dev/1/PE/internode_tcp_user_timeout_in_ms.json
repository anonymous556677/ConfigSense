    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The 'internode_tcp_user_timeout_in_ms' configuration is not performance-sensitive based on the provided code context and developer information. The code snippet shows that this configuration is used to set the amount of time to wait for internode tcp connections to establish in Cassandra. While the timeout value is important for managing network connections, it does not directly involve any time-expensive or memory-expensive operations that would lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The configuration simply returns a timeout value based on the connection category without any complex computations or resource-intensive tasks. Therefore, it does not have a substantial impact on system performance and is not classified as performance-sensitive."
