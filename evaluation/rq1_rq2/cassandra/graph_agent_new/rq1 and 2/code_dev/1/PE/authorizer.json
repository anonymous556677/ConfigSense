    "Reason": "The configuration code is responsible for handling permissions and access control, which is essential for the security and functionality of the system. While it may impact system performance indirectly by adding an extra layer of authorization checks, the primary focus is on security rather than performance optimization. The configuration-related code does not contain any time-expensive or memory-expensive operations that would directly impact system performance significantly."
