    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'internode_tcp_connect_timeout_in_ms' is not performance-sensitive. The code snippet provided does not contain any performance-intensive operations that would significantly impact system performance. The configuration is simply retrieving a timeout value from the DatabaseDescriptor to determine the amount of time to wait for internode tcp connections to establish. This operation is not time-expensive or memory-expensive, and it does not lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Additionally, the developer's explanation of the configuration's purpose and impact also supports the classification of 'No' as it focuses on network partition protection rather than performance optimization."
