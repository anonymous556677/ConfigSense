    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'cdc_total_space_in_mb' is performance-sensitive. This is because the code snippet provided involves a multiplication operation that can potentially be time-expensive, especially when dealing with large values. Additionally, the configuration directly impacts the system performance by setting a threshold for space usage, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, such as triggering WriteTimeoutException on Mutations. Therefore, the configuration is considered performance-sensitive based on its code context and impact on system performance."
