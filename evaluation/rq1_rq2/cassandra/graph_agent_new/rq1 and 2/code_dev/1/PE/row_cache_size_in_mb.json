    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'row_cache_size_in_mb' configuration is performance-sensitive. The configuration directly affects the memory consumption of the system by setting the maximum size of the row cache in memory. The code snippets provided show that the value of 'row_cache_size_in_mb' is used to set the capacity of the cache in bytes, which can have a significant impact on the system's memory usage. Setting a larger value for this configuration can lead to higher memory consumption, potentially causing memory-related issues such as out-of-memory errors or system slowdowns. Therefore, the configuration is considered performance-sensitive as it directly and substantially affects system performance at the memory level."
