    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'batchlog_replay_throttle_in_kb' is performance-sensitive. This is because it directly affects the rate at which failed batches are replayed, which can have a significant impact on system performance. The code context shows that this configuration is used to set the rate at which batches are replayed in the replayFailedBatches() method. If the throttle is set too low, it can result in slower batch replay and potential backlog of failed batches, impacting system performance. On the other hand, setting it too high may lead to increased system load and potential performance issues. Therefore, the configuration directly and substantially affects system performance at the system level, making it performance-sensitive."
