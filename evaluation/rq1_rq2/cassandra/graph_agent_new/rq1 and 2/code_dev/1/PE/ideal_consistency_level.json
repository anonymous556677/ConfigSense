    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'ideal_consistency_level' configuration is performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration involves tracking the ideal consistency level for each write operation, which adds overhead to the system. The code related to this configuration includes operations that contribute to execution time and memory consumption, such as setting up response handlers based on the ideal consistency level. These operations can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, making the configuration performance-sensitive."
