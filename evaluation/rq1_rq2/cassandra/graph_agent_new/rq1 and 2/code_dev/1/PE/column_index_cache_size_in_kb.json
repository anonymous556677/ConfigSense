    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'column_index_cache_size_in_kb' is performance-sensitive. This is because it directly affects the memory usage of the system, which can lead to significant performance variations at the system level. The code context shows that this configuration is used to determine the size limit for sstable indexed key cache entries, impacting memory consumption. If the size limit is not properly configured, it can result in more frequent disk reads for index entries, affecting system performance. Therefore, the configuration involves memory-expensive operations that can have a notable impact on system performance."
