    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'read_request_timeout_in_ms' configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the timeout duration for read operations in the system. This configuration is used in critical methods like 'getMinRpcTimeout', 'ColumnFamilyStore' constructor, 'getTimeout', 'setup', 'getReadRpcTimeout', 'awaitWrites' which are essential for system operation. The timeout value set by this configuration can significantly affect the overall performance and responsiveness of the system, making it a key factor in determining system performance at the system level."
