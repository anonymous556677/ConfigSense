    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'stream_entire_sstables' configuration is classified as performance-sensitive. This is because enabling this configuration directly impacts system performance by allowing Cassandra to zero-copy stream entire eligible SSTables between nodes, which can significantly speed up network transfer and reduce GC pressure. The code context shows that the configuration is checked in the method computeShouldStreamEntireSSTables(), which involves performance-related operations related to SSTable transfers. Additionally, the configuration has the potential to cause notable performance variations at the system level by affecting network traffic and resource usage."
