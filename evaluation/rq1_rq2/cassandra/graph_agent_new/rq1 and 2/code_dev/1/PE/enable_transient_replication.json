    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'enable_transient_replication' configuration option is performance-sensitive because it directly affects the system performance by enabling or disabling transient replication. This configuration involves checking if transient replication is enabled in the code, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The code snippet related to this configuration includes operations that contribute to execution time and memory consumption, such as checking for transient replicas and validating options based on the replication factor. Therefore, the configuration is considered performance-sensitive as it has a substantial impact on system performance."
