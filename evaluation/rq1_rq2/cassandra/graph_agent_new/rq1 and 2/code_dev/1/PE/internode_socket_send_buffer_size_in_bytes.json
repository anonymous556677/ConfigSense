    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'internode_socket_send_buffer_size_in_bytes' is performance-sensitive. The code context shows that the configuration directly impacts the socket buffer size for internode communication, which can significantly affect the performance and efficiency of internode communication at the system level. The configuration involves performance-related operations related to setting or updating the socket buffer size, which can be time-expensive and memory-expensive, leading to notable performance variations. Therefore, it meets the criteria of being performance-sensitive."
