    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'internode_application_receive_queue_reserve_endpoint_capacity_in_bytes' is performance-sensitive. This is because it directly impacts the memory consumption and message processing efficiency at the system level. The code context shows that this configuration sets limits on the size of messages that can be queued for delivery and processing, which can significantly affect the overall performance of internode communication. By controlling the message queue size, it helps prevent memory exhaustion and ensures smoother communication between nodes, making it a critical factor for system performance."
