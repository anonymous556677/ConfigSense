The key cache is fairly tiny for the amount of time it saves, so it's worthwhile to use it at large numbers. The row cache saves even more time, but must contain the entire row, so it is extremely space-intensive. It's best to only use the row cache if you have hot rows or static rows.  NOTE: if you reduce the size, you may not get you hottest keys loaded on startup.  Default value is empty to make it \"auto\" (min(5% of Heap (in MB), 100MB)). Set to 0 to disable key cache.",
    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The 'key_cache_size_in_mb' configuration determines the maximum size of the key cache in memory. This configuration is used to initialize the key cache in the code by setting the capacity of the cache based on the value provided. The key cache is then used to store key-value pairs for quick retrieval.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The 'key_cache_size_in_mb' configuration is triggered when the system initializes the key cache. This typically happens when the system starts up or when the cache needs to be reinitialized based on the configured size.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the 'key_cache_size_in_mb' configuration option on the system is significant. A larger cache size can improve performance by reducing the number of seeks required for cache hits. However, a larger cache size also consumes more memory, which can impact overall system performance and resource utilization. It is important to find a balance between cache size and system resources to optimize performance."
