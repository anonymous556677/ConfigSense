The code checks if the value is already set, and if not, it retrieves the value from the DatabaseDescriptor.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The triggering frequency of the 'internode_tcp_connect_timeout_in_ms' configuration depends on the frequency of internode tcp connections being established in the system. It will be triggered whenever a new internode tcp connection is being established.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the 'internode_tcp_connect_timeout_in_ms' configuration option is that it helps in protecting Cassandra from true network partitions by setting a timeout for internode tcp connections. This can prevent potential issues that may arise from long waiting times for connections to establish."
