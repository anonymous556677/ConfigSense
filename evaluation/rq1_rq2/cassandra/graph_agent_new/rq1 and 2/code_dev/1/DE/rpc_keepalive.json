    "config_description": "enable or disable keepalive on rpc/native connections",
    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The configuration 'rpc_keepalive' is used to enable or disable keepalive on rpc/native connections. In the code snippet provided, the configuration is used in the PipelineConfigurator to set the value for keepalive.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The triggering frequency of the 'rpc_keepalive' configuration depends on the specific use case and how often rpc/native connections are established and closed in the system. If keepalive is enabled, it will be triggered whenever a connection is established to ensure that the connection remains active.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "Enabling keepalive on rpc/native connections can have an impact on system resources as it may keep connections open for longer periods, potentially increasing resource usage. However, it can also improve performance by reducing the overhead of establishing new connections for frequent communication."
