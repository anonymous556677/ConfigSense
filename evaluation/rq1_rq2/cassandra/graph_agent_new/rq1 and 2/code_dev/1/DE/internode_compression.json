    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The configuration 'internode_compression' is used in the shouldCompressConnection method to determine whether the connection between nodes should be compressed. It checks if the internodeCompression setting in the DatabaseDescriptor is set to 'all' or 'dc' and if the connection is not within the local datacenter.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The triggering frequency of the 'internode_compression' configuration depends on the traffic between nodes and the setting chosen. If a lot of inter-node communication is happening and the setting is 'all' or 'dc', then this configuration will be triggered frequently.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the 'internode_compression' configuration on the system can be significant in terms of network bandwidth and CPU usage. If all traffic is compressed, it can reduce network traffic but increase CPU usage. If only traffic between datacenters is compressed, it can still reduce network traffic but with less CPU overhead compared to compressing all traffic. If compression is disabled, it can increase network traffic but reduce CPU usage."
