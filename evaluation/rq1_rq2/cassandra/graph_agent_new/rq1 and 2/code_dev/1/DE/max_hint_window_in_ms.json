    "config_description": "this defines the maximum amount of time a dead host will have hints generated.  After it has been dead this long, new hints for it will not be created until it has been seen alive and gone down again.",
    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The configuration 'max_hint_window_in_ms' is used to define the maximum amount of time a dead host will have hints generated. The code snippet provided checks if the hint window for a dead host has expired before generating new hints for it.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The configuration 'max_hint_window_in_ms' is triggered whenever the system checks for hint generation for a dead host. The frequency of triggering depends on the number of dead hosts and their downtime exceeding the configured maximum hint window time.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the 'max_hint_window_in_ms' configuration option is that it controls the generation of hints for dead hosts. Setting a higher value for this configuration can potentially lead to more hints being generated for hosts that have been down for a longer period, increasing the load on the system. On the other hand, setting a lower value may result in fewer hints being generated, potentially affecting data availability for hosts that frequently go down."
