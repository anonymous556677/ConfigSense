    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The 'memtable_offheap_space_in_mb' configuration is used to set the total permitted memory to use for off-heap memtables in Cassandra.

    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The triggering frequency of the 'memtable_offheap_space_in_mb' configuration in the system depends on the memtable_cleanup_threshold set in the configuration. When the off-heap memtable space exceeds the threshold, Cassandra will trigger a flush to clear the memtable and free up space for new writes.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the 'memtable_offheap_space_in_mb' configuration on the system is significant as it determines the total memory available for off-heap memtables. If the configured value is too low, it can lead to frequent flushes and performance degradation. On the other hand, setting it too high can result in excessive memory usage and potential out-of-memory errors."
