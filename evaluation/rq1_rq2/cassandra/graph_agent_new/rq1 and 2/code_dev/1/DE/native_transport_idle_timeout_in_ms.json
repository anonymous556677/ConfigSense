    "config_description": "Controls when idle client connections are closed. Idle connections are ones that had neither reads nor writes for a time period.  Clients may implement heartbeats by sending OPTIONS native protocol message after a timeout, which will reset idle timeout timer on the server side. To close idle client connections, corresponding values for heartbeat intervals have to be set on the client side.  Idle connection timeouts are disabled by default.",
    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The configuration 'native_transport_idle_timeout_in_ms' controls when idle client connections are closed. If a client connection has neither reads nor writes for a specified time period (configured in milliseconds), it will be closed. Clients can prevent their connections from being closed by sending OPTIONS native protocol messages after a timeout, which resets the idle timeout timer on the server side.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The configuration is triggered whenever a client connection becomes idle and has neither reads nor writes for the specified time period set in 'native_transport_idle_timeout_in_ms'. This triggering frequency depends on the behavior of clients and their interaction with the server.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the 'native_transport_idle_timeout_in_ms' configuration option on the system is that it helps manage and close idle client connections, freeing up resources and potentially improving overall system performance. By setting appropriate values for idle timeout, the system can efficiently handle client connections and prevent resource wastage."
