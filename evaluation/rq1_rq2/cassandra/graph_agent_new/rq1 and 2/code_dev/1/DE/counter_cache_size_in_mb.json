In case of RF = 1 a counter cache hit will cause Cassandra to skip the read before write entirely. With RF > 1 a counter cache hit will still help to reduce the duration of the lock hold, helping with hot counter cell updates, but will not allow skipping the read entirely. Only the local (clock, count) tuple of a counter cell is kept in memory, not the whole counter, so it's relatively cheap.  NOTE: if you reduce the size, you may not get you hottest keys loaded on startup.  Default value is empty to make it \"auto\" (min(2.5% of Heap (in MB), 50MB)). Set to 0 to disable counter cache. NOTE: if you perform counter deletes and rely on low gcgs, you should disable the counter cache.",
    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The 'counter_cache_size_in_mb' configuration determines the maximum size of the counter cache in memory. It is used to reduce counter locks' contention for hot counter cells. The code initializes a counter cache with the specified capacity in MBs and schedules saving of keys at a specified period.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The configuration is triggered whenever the counter cache is initialized or when the counter cache save period is reached. The frequency of triggering depends on the values set for 'counter_cache_size_in_mb' and 'counter_cache_save_period'.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the 'counter_cache_size_in_mb' configuration option is significant on the system. Setting a higher value can improve performance by reducing contention for hot counter cells and potentially skipping read operations. However, setting a lower value may result in not loading the hottest keys on startup. It is recommended to set the value based on the system's memory constraints and workload requirements. Disabling the counter cache can also have implications for performance, especially if counter deletes are performed frequently."
