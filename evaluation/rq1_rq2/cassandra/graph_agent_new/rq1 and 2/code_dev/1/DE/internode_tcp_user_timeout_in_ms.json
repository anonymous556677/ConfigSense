The amount of time to wait for internode tcp connections to establish. internode_tcp_connect_timeout_in_ms: 2000  The amount of time unacknowledged data is allowed on a connection before we throw out the connection Note this is only supported on Linux + epoll, and it appears to behave oddly above a setting of 30000 (it takes much longer than 30s) as of Linux 4.12. If you want something that high set this to 0 which picks up the OS default and configure the net.ipv4.tcp_retries2 sysctl to be ~8.",
    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The configuration 'internode_tcp_user_timeout_in_ms' is used to set the amount of time to wait for internode tcp connections to establish in Cassandra. The code snippet provided shows that the method 'tcpUserTimeoutInMS' is used to return the configured timeout value. If the value is not set, it defaults to values obtained from 'DatabaseDescriptor.getInternodeTcpUserTimeoutInMS()' or 'DatabaseDescriptor.getInternodeStreamingTcpUserTimeoutInMS()' based on the connection category.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The triggering frequency of the 'internode_tcp_user_timeout_in_ms' configuration depends on the frequency of establishing internode tcp connections in the system. If there are frequent internode communication activities, this configuration will be triggered more often.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the 'internode_tcp_user_timeout_in_ms' configuration option is crucial for protecting Cassandra from network partitions. Setting an appropriate timeout value can help in managing unacknowledged data on connections and preventing potential issues. However, setting it too high may lead to unexpected behavior, especially on Linux systems above a certain threshold."
