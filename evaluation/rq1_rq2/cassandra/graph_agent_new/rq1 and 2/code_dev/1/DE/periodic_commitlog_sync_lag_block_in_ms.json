    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The 'periodic_commitlog_sync_lag_block_in_ms' configuration is used in the PeriodicCommitLogService class to determine the amount of time to block writes while waiting for a slow disk flush to complete. It calculates the expected sync time based on the current system time and the configured block time in milliseconds.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The triggering frequency of the 'periodic_commitlog_sync_lag_block_in_ms' configuration depends on the system's disk flush performance and the frequency of writes to the commit log. If the disk flush is slow or if there are frequent writes, this configuration will be triggered more often.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the 'periodic_commitlog_sync_lag_block_in_ms' configuration on the system is that it can potentially delay write operations if the disk flush takes longer than the configured block time. This can affect the overall performance and latency of write operations in the system."
