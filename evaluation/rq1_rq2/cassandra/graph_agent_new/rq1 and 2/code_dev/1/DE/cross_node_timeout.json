If disabled, replicas will assume that requests were forwarded to them instantly by the coordinator, which means that under overload conditions we will waste that much extra time processing already-timed-out requests.  Warning: It is generally assumed that users have setup NTP on their clusters, and that clocks are modestly in sync, since this is a requirement for general correctness of last write wins.",
    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The configuration 'cross_node_timeout' is checked in the code to determine whether to enable operation timeout information exchange between nodes. If the configuration is enabled (DatabaseDescriptor.hasCrossNodeTimeout() returns true) and the createdAtNanos is less than or equal to the currentTimeNanos, then the createdAtNanos is updated to currentTimeNanos. The method then calculates and returns the expiration time in nanoseconds.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The triggering frequency of the 'cross_node_timeout' configuration depends on the usage of the method getExpiresAtNanos(). Whenever this method is called to calculate the expiration time for an operation, the configuration check is performed to determine if operation timeout information exchange between nodes should be enabled.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the 'cross_node_timeout' configuration option is significant for accurately measuring request timeouts between nodes. If the configuration is disabled, replicas will assume that requests were forwarded instantly by the coordinator, potentially leading to wasted time processing already-timed-out requests under overload conditions. It is important for users to have NTP setup on their clusters and ensure clocks are in sync for the general correctness of last write wins."
