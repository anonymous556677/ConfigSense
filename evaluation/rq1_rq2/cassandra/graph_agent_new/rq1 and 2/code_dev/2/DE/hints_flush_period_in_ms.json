    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The configuration 'hints_flush_period_in_ms' is used to determine how often hints should be flushed from the internal buffers to disk. It is set in the HintsService constructor to schedule periodic flushing of the buffers.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The configuration is triggered in the system by scheduling a task with a fixed delay using ScheduledExecutors. The task calls the writeExecutor.flushBufferPool(bufferPool) method at the specified flushPeriod interval.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the 'hints_flush_period_in_ms' configuration option is that it determines the frequency at which hints are flushed to disk. A shorter flush period may result in more frequent disk writes, potentially impacting system performance and disk I/O. On the other hand, a longer flush period may lead to increased memory usage as hints accumulate in the buffers before being flushed."
