    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The configuration 'memtable_heap_space_in_mb' is used to set the total permitted memory to use for memtables in the system. The code snippet provided shows how the configuration value is fetched from the DatabaseDescriptor and used to create a MemtablePool with specific limits and cleaning thresholds based on the allocation type.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The triggering frequency of the 'memtable_heap_space_in_mb' configuration in the system depends on the memtable_cleanup_threshold set in the DatabaseDescriptor. When the total memory used for memtables exceeds the limit specified by 'memtable_heap_space_in_mb', Cassandra will stop accepting writes until a flush completes. The frequency of triggering a flush is determined by the memtable_cleanup_threshold.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the 'memtable_heap_space_in_mb' configuration option on the system is significant. If the configured limit is too low, it can lead to frequent flushes and potentially impact the system's performance. On the other hand, setting a high limit can result in increased memory usage and potential out-of-memory errors. It is crucial to tune this configuration based on the system's requirements and available resources."
