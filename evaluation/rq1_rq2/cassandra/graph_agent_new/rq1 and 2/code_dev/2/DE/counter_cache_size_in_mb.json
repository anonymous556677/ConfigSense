In case of RF = 1 a counter cache hit will cause Cassandra to skip the read before write entirely. With RF > 1 a counter cache hit will still help to reduce the duration of the lock hold, helping with hot counter cell updates, but will not allow skipping the read entirely. Only the local (clock, count) tuple of a counter cell is kept in memory, not the whole counter, so it's relatively cheap.  NOTE: if you reduce the size, you may not get you hottest keys loaded on startup.  Default value is empty to make it \"auto\" (min(2.5% of Heap (in MB), 50MB)). Set to 0 to disable counter cache. NOTE: if you perform counter deletes and rely on low gcgs, you should disable the counter cache.",

    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the 'counter_cache_size_in_mb' configuration option is that it determines the maximum size of the counter cache in memory. Setting a higher value for this configuration can help in reducing counter locks' contention for hot counter cells, but it may consume more memory. On the other hand, setting a lower value may not load the hottest keys on startup. Additionally, setting the configuration to 0 disables the counter cache, which may impact performance if counter deletes are performed and low gcgs are relied upon."
