    "config_description": "Total space to use for change-data-capture logs on disk.  If space gets above this value, Cassandra will throw WriteTimeoutException on Mutations including tables with CDC enabled. A CDCCompactor is responsible for parsing the raw CDC logs and deleting them when parsing is completed.  The default value is the min of 4096 mb and 1/8th of the total space of the drive where cdc_raw_directory resides.",
    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The configuration code 'cdc_total_space_in_mb' is used to determine the total space available for change-data-capture logs on disk. It retrieves the value set in the DatabaseDescriptor for CDC space in MB and converts it to bytes by multiplying with 1024*1024.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The triggering frequency of the 'cdc_total_space_in_mb' configuration depends on the usage of change-data-capture logs in the system. Whenever the space occupied by CDC logs reaches or exceeds the specified total space limit, Cassandra will throw WriteTimeoutException on Mutations including tables with CDC enabled.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the 'cdc_total_space_in_mb' configuration option on the system is significant. If the space allocated for CDC logs exceeds the specified limit, it can lead to WriteTimeoutException on Mutations, affecting the performance and reliability of the system. It is crucial to monitor and manage the CDC log space to avoid such issues."
