    "config_description": "Enable operation timeout information exchange between nodes to accurately measure request timeouts.  If disabled, replicas will assume that requests were forwarded to them instantly by the coordinator, which means that under overload conditions we will waste that much extra time processing already-timed-out requests.  Warning: It is generally assumed that users have setup NTP on their clusters, and that clocks are modestly in sync, since this is a requirement for general correctness of last write wins.",
    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The 'cross_node_timeout' configuration is checked in the getExpiresAtNanos method to determine if operation timeout information exchange between nodes should be enabled. If the DatabaseDescriptor hasCrossNodeTimeout() returns false or the createdAtNanos is greater than the currentTimeNanos, the createdAtNanos is set to currentTimeNanos. This configuration affects the calculation of the expiration time for a given operation.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The triggering frequency of the 'cross_node_timeout' configuration depends on the frequency of calls to the getExpiresAtNanos method in the codebase. The configuration is checked each time the getExpiresAtNanos method is called.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "Enabling the 'cross_node_timeout' configuration allows for accurate measurement of request timeouts between nodes. If disabled, replicas may incorrectly assume that requests were forwarded instantly by the coordinator, leading to wasted processing time on already-timed-out requests. This configuration is important for maintaining system efficiency and preventing unnecessary processing of timed-out requests."
