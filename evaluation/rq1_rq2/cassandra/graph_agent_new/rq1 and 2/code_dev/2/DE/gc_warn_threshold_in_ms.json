    "config_description": "GC Pauses greater than gc_warn_threshold_in_ms will be logged at WARN level Adjust the threshold based on your application throughput requirement. Setting to 0 will deactivate the feature.",
    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The configuration 'gc_warn_threshold_in_ms' is used to set a threshold for logging GC pauses at the WARN level. If the GC pause exceeds the specified threshold, it will be logged as a warning. The configuration allows developers to adjust the threshold based on the application's throughput requirement, and setting it to 0 will deactivate the feature.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The triggering frequency of the 'gc_warn_threshold_in_ms' configuration depends on the GC pauses during the system's runtime. If the GC pause exceeds the specified threshold, it will trigger the logging at the WARN level.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the 'gc_warn_threshold_in_ms' configuration option is on the system's performance monitoring and logging. By setting an appropriate threshold, developers can control the level of detail in GC pause logging and potentially optimize the system's performance based on the application's requirements."
