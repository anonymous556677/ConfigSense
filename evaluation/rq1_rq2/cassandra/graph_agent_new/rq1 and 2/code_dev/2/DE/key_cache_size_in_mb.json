The key cache is fairly tiny for the amount of time it saves, so it's worthwhile to use it at large numbers. The row cache saves even more time, but must contain the entire row, so it is extremely space-intensive. It's best to only use the row cache if you have hot rows or static rows.  NOTE: if you reduce the size, you may not get you hottest keys loaded on startup.  Default value is empty to make it \"auto\" (min(5% of Heap (in MB), 100MB)). Set to 0 to disable key cache.",

Setting a larger value for this configuration can improve performance by reducing the number of seeks required for key cache hits. However, it also increases memory usage as the key cache is stored in memory. On the other hand, setting a smaller value or disabling the key cache can result in more seeks and potentially slower performance, especially for hot keys."
