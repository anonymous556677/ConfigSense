This means that only partition information is held on heap and the index entries are read from disk.  Note that this size refers to the size of the serialized index information and not the size of the partition.",
    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The configuration 'column_index_cache_size_in_kb' is used to determine the size limit for sstable indexed key cache entries. If the entries exceed this size, they will not be held in heap memory and instead, only partition information will be held in memory while the index entries are read from disk.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The triggering frequency of this configuration depends on the amount of indexed key cache entries that exceed the specified size limit. If the size limit is frequently exceeded, the configuration will be triggered more often.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the 'column_index_cache_size_in_kb' configuration option is significant as it affects the memory usage and performance of the system. If the size limit is set too low, it may result in frequent disk reads for index entries, impacting the system's overall performance. On the other hand, setting it too high may lead to excessive memory usage. Therefore, it is crucial to set this configuration appropriately based on the system's requirements."
