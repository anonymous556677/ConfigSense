    "config_description": "Controls when idle client connections are closed. Idle connections are ones that had neither reads nor writes for a time period.  Clients may implement heartbeats by sending OPTIONS native protocol message after a timeout, which will reset idle timeout timer on the server side. To close idle client connections, corresponding values for heartbeat intervals have to be set on the client side.  Idle connection timeouts are disabled by default.",
    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The native_transport_idle_timeout_in_ms configuration controls when idle client connections are closed. If the idle timeout value is set to a positive number, an IdleStateHandler is added to the ChannelPipeline. This handler will close client connections that have been idle for the specified timeout period.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The triggering frequency of the native_transport_idle_timeout_in_ms configuration depends on the idle behavior of client connections. If clients do not send any reads or writes within the specified idle timeout period, the configuration will trigger to close the idle connections.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the native_transport_idle_timeout_in_ms configuration option is that it helps manage and control the number of idle client connections in the system. By closing idle connections, system resources can be freed up and potential connection leaks can be avoided."
