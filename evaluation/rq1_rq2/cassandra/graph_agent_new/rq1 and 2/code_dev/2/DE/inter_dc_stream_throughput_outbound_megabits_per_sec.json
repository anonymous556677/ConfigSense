    "config_description": "Throttles all streaming file transfer between the datacenters, this setting allows users to throttle inter dc stream throughput in addition to throttling all network stream traffic as configured with stream_throughput_outbound_megabits_per_sec When unset, the default is 200 Mbps or 25 MB/s",
    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The configuration 'inter_dc_stream_throughput_outbound_megabits_per_sec' is used to throttle all streaming file transfer between datacenters. It allows users to set a limit on the inter-DC stream throughput, in addition to the overall network stream traffic limit set by 'stream_throughput_outbound_megabits_per_sec'. The code provided includes methods to set and get the value of this configuration, as well as a method to calculate the inter-DC rate in bytes based on the configured throughput.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The configuration is triggered whenever the 'setInterDCStreamThroughputMbPerSec' method is called to set a new value for the inter-DC stream throughput. The 'updateInterDCThroughput' method is then called to apply the new throughput limit.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of this configuration option is that it allows users to control the rate of data transfer between datacenters, preventing potential network congestion or overloading. By setting a lower value, users can limit the amount of data transferred between datacenters, which can help in managing network resources and ensuring smooth operation of the system."
