    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The 'ideal_consistency_level' configuration in the code tracks a metric per keyspace to indicate whether replication achieved the ideal consistency level for writes without timing out. It compares the ideal consistency level with the consistency level requested by each write to determine if the ideal consistency level was achieved.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The 'ideal_consistency_level' configuration is triggered whenever a write operation is performed in the system. This means that the configuration is triggered whenever a write request is made to ensure that the replication achieves the ideal consistency level.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the 'ideal_consistency_level' configuration option is that it adds additional tracking and comparison logic to each write operation in the system. This can potentially increase the processing time for each write request as the system needs to compare the requested consistency level with the ideal consistency level."
