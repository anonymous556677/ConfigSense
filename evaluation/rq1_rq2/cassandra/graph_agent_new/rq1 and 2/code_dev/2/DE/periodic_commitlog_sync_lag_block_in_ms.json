    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The configuration 'periodic_commitlog_sync_lag_block_in_ms' is used in the PeriodicCommitLogService class to determine the amount of time to block writes while waiting for a slow disk flush to complete. The blockWhenSyncLagsNanos variable is calculated based on the value of 'periodic_commitlog_sync_lag_block_in_ms' converted to nanoseconds.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The triggering frequency of the 'periodic_commitlog_sync_lag_block_in_ms' configuration depends on the frequency of slow disk flushes during periodic commitlog mode. It is triggered whenever a slow disk flush occurs and the system needs to block writes temporarily.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the 'periodic_commitlog_sync_lag_block_in_ms' configuration option is that it can affect the performance of write operations during periodic commitlog mode. A higher value for this configuration may result in longer write blocking times, potentially impacting the overall throughput of the system."
