    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'cached_rows_fail_threshold' configuration is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the configuration directly affects the system's performance by setting a threshold for the number of cached replica rows that can fail before triggering actions related to replica filtering protection. This threshold directly impacts the execution time and memory consumption of the system, as it determines when certain actions are taken to ensure data consistency. Additionally, the code context shows that the configuration is used in critical operations related to resolving with replica filtering protection, which are time-expensive and memory-expensive operations that can lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
