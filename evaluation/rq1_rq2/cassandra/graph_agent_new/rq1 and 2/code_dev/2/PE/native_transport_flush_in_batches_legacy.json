{
    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'native_transport_flush_in_batches_legacy' is classified as performance-sensitive. This is because enabling this configuration directly affects system performance at the system level by improving throughput, especially in scenarios where there is a decrease in throughput after upgrading to version 4.0. The code context shows that the configuration is triggered during the initialization of the Server class, specifically when creating the pipelineConfigurator object. The use of this configuration involves performance-related operations that contribute positively to execution time and memory consumption, leading to notable performance variations at the system level."
