    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'full_query_logging_options' is performance-sensitive. This is because the code context shows that the configuration involves operations that can have a notable impact on system performance. The enableFullQueryLogger method allows for overriding default options with new values, which can lead to time-expensive and memory-expensive operations when logging full queries. Setting larger values for parameters like max_log_size or max_queue_weight can increase disk space usage and processing overhead, affecting system performance at the system level."
