    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'file_cache_enabled' configuration option is performance-sensitive. This is because enabling this configuration directly impacts system performance by determining whether the sstable chunk cache should be enabled or not. The 'enabled' flag is set based on the value returned by 'DatabaseDescriptor.getFileCacheEnabled()' and the 'cacheSize'. If enabled, an instance of ChunkCache is created, which involves time-expensive operations like cache loading and buffer handling. This configuration directly affects memory consumption and execution time at the system level, leading to notable performance variations."
