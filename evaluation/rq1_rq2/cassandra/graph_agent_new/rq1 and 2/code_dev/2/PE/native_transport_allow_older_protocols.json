    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'native_transport_allow_older_protocols' is performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly affects the system's performance at the system level by controlling which protocol versions are honored, which can lead to notable performance variations. In the code context, the configuration is used to decode the protocol version and determine behavior based on the value of 'DatabaseDescriptor.getNativeTransportAllowOlderProtocols()'. This involves time-expensive operations like protocol version decoding and decision-making based on the configuration value, which can impact system performance significantly."
