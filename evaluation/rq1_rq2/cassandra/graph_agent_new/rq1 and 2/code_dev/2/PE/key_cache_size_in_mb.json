    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'key_cache_size_in_mb' configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts system performance at the system level. The size of the key cache in memory is determined by this configuration, which affects the number of seeks required for key cache hits. This can lead to notable performance variations in terms of memory consumption and execution time. The code context shows that the configuration is used to initialize the key cache with the specified capacity in MBs, indicating that it involves time-expensive and memory-expensive operations. Therefore, any changes to this configuration can have a significant impact on system performance."
