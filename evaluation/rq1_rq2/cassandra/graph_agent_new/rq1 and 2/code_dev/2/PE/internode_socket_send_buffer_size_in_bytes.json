{
    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'internode_socket_send_buffer_size_in_bytes' is classified as performance-sensitive. The code context shows that the configuration directly affects the size of the socket buffer for internode communication, which can have a significant impact on the performance and efficiency of internode communication in the system. Additionally, the configuration involves performance-related operations that can be time-expensive, as it checks and retrieves the socket buffer size value. This can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, making it a performance-sensitive configuration."
