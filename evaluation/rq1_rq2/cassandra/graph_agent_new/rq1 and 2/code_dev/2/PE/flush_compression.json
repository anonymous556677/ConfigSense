    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'flush_compression' configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the performance of flush operations at the system level. The code snippet provided shows that the configuration determines the compression parameters for flushing SSTables based on the operation type. The choice of compression algorithm can significantly affect the throughput of the flush operation, especially for large tables, and potentially block writes. The configuration involves selecting a compressor based on the 'DatabaseDescriptor.getFlushCompression()' value, which can lead to notable performance variations depending on the chosen compression algorithm. Therefore, the 'flush_compression' configuration is considered performance-sensitive as it involves time-expensive operations that directly impact system performance."
