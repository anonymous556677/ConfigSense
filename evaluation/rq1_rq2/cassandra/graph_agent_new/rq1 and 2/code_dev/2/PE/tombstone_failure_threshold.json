    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'tombstone_failure_threshold' configuration is performance-sensitive. This is because it directly affects the performance of read operations by setting a limit on the number of tombstones scanned during reads. Excessive scanning of tombstones can lead to performance degradation and potential timeouts. The configuration is used to optimize read performance and prevent issues related to tombstone processing, making it crucial for system performance at the system level."
