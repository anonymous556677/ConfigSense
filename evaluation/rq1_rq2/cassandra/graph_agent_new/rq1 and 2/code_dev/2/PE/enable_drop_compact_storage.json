    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'enable_drop_compact_storage' is performance-sensitive. This is because the code context shows that the configuration directly impacts the storage format and performance of tables by allowing or disallowing the dropping of compact storage. The 'DatabaseDescriptor.enableDropCompactStorage()' method, when returning true, enables the execution of 'ALTER ... DROP COMPACT STORAGE' statements, which can have significant performance implications at the system level. The configuration involves performance-related operations that are time-expensive and memory-expensive, leading to notable performance variations when executed."
