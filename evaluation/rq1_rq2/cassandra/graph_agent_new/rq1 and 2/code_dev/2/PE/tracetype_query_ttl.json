    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The 'tracetype_query_ttl' configuration option is not performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the configuration is primarily used to define the TTL for different trace types during the logging of the repair process. While the configuration impacts the storage space used for storing trace sessions, it does not involve any time-expensive or memory-expensive operations that would lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The code related to this configuration mainly deals with managing trace sessions and does not contain operations that significantly affect system performance."
