    "Reason": "The configuration option is not performance-sensitive. The code primarily deals with authentication, authorization, and role management, which are essential for security but do not involve operations that are time-expensive or memory-expensive. The configuration focuses on managing permissions and roles rather than performance optimizations. Additionally, the operations performed by the configuration are necessary for security and access control, rather than for performance enhancements."
