    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'internode_streaming_tcp_user_timeout_in_ms' is performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly affects the system performance at the system level by setting the timeout for unacknowledged data on streaming connections. The code snippet provided shows that the configuration is used to check if the processing time of incoming stream messages exceeds the specified timeout value. If the processing time exceeds the timeout, a warning is logged and the streaming connection might be closed, impacting system performance. Therefore, the configuration involves performance-related operations that are time-extensive and can lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
