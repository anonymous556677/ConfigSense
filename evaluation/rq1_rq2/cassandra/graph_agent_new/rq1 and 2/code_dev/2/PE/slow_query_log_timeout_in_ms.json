    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'slow_query_log_timeout_in_ms' is performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly affects the system's performance monitoring capabilities by determining how long a node logs slow queries. The code context shows that the configuration is used to set a timeout for monitoring the execution time of select queries. If a query exceeds this timeout, it triggers the slow query logging mechanism, which can have a notable impact on system performance at the system level. Therefore, the configuration involves performance-related operations that are time-expensive and lead to notable performance variations, making it performance-sensitive."
