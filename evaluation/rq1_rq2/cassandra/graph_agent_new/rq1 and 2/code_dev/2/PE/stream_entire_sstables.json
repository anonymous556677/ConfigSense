    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'stream_entire_sstables' configuration is performance-sensitive. This is because enabling this configuration directly impacts system performance by allowing Cassandra to zero-copy stream entire eligible SSTables between nodes, which can significantly speed up network transfer and reduce GC pressure. The code context shows that the configuration is checked in the computeShouldStreamEntireSSTables() method, which is called during node-to-node data transfer operations. The configuration involves performance-related operations that are time-expensive and memory-expensive, leading to notable performance variations at the system level."
