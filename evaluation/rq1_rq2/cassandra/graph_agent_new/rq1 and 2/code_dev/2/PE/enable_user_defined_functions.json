    "Reason": "The configuration 'enable_user_defined_functions' does not involve any performance-related operations that are time-expensive or memory-expensive within its related code. The code snippet provided only checks if the configuration is enabled and throws an exception if it is not. While enabling or disabling this configuration can impact system security and functionality, it does not directly and substantially affect system performance at the system level. Therefore, it is not considered performance-sensitive."
