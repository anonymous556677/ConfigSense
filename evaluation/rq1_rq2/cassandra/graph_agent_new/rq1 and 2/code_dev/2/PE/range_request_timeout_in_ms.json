    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'range_request_timeout_in_ms' is performance-sensitive. This is because it directly affects the timeout for sequential or index scans, which are critical operations in the system. The code context shows that this configuration is used in methods like getTimeout and getRangeRpcTimeout, which are time-expensive operations. Changing the value of 'range_request_timeout_in_ms' can have a notable impact on the overall system performance by affecting the response times of these scans. Therefore, any adjustments to this configuration can lead to significant performance variations at the system level."
