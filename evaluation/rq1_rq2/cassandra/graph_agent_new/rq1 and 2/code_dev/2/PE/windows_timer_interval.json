    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'windows_timer_interval' is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts system performance by adjusting the system timer on Windows from 15ms to 1ms. This adjustment affects timer intervals, thread scheduling, driver interrupts, and overall system performance. The code snippets related to this configuration involve time-expensive operations like starting and stopping the daemon, adjusting the timer period, and managing shutdown hooks. These operations contribute significantly to execution time and memory consumption, leading to notable performance variations at the system level."
