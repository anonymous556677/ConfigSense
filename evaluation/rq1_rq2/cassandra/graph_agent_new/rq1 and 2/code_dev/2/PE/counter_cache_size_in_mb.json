    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'counter_cache_size_in_mb' configuration is classified as performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly affects the system's performance at the system level by determining the maximum size of the counter cache in memory. The code snippet provided shows that the configuration is used to initialize the counter cache with the specified capacity in MBs, which involves memory-expensive operations. Changing the value of this configuration can lead to notable performance variations, as it impacts the memory consumption of the system. Additionally, the developer's explanation highlights the potential impact of setting a higher or lower value for this configuration on system performance, further emphasizing its sensitivity."
