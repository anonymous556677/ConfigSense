    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'internode_application_send_queue_capacity_in_bytes' is performance-sensitive. This is because it directly impacts the amount of data that can be queued for transmission between nodes, which can significantly affect the system's performance and resource utilization. The code context shows that this configuration involves retrieving and setting the application send queue capacity in bytes, which can be time-expensive and memory-expensive operations. Additionally, the triggering frequency of this configuration depends on the communication activity within the cluster, indicating its importance in system performance. Therefore, based on the code context and the developer's explanation, it can be concluded that this configuration is performance-sensitive."
