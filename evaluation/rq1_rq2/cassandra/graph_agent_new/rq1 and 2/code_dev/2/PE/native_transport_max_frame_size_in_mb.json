    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'native_transport_max_frame_size_in_mb' is performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly affects the maximum size of frames that can be processed, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The code context shows that the configuration is used to set the maximum allowed frame size, and changing this value can impact memory usage and processing time. Therefore, any changes to this configuration can have a significant impact on system performance."
