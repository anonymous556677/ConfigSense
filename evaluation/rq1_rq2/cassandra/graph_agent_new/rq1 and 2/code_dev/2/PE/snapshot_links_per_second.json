    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'snapshot_links_per_second' configuration is performance-sensitive. The configuration directly affects system performance by throttling the creation or clearing of snapshot links, potentially tens of thousands at a time. This involves time-expensive operations that can have a notable impact on system performance. The code context also shows that the configuration is used to create a RateLimiter, indicating its importance in controlling the rate of snapshot link operations. Overall, the configuration involves performance-related operations that are time-extensive and lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
