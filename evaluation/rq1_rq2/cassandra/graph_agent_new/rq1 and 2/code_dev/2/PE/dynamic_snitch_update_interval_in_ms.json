    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'dynamic_snitch_update_interval_in_ms' configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly affects the frequency of host score calculation updates in the system. The code context shows that this configuration controls the interval at which the update and reset scheduler tasks are executed, impacting the accuracy of host scores. A shorter interval can lead to more frequent updates, potentially increasing system overhead, while a longer interval may reduce accuracy but decrease overhead. Therefore, changes to this configuration can have notable performance variations at the system level."
