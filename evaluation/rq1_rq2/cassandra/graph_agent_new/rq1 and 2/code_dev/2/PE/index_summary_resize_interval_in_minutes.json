    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'index_summary_resize_interval_in_minutes' is not performance-sensitive. The code snippet provided shows that this configuration is used to determine how frequently index summaries should be resampled, which does not involve any time-expensive or memory-expensive operations. The configuration setting only affects the frequency of a specific process and does not directly and substantially impact system performance at the system level. Therefore, it does not lead to notable performance variations and should be classified as not performance-sensitive."
