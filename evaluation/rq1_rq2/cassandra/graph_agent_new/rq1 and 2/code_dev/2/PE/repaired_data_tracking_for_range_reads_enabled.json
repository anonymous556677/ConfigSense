    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'repaired_data_tracking_for_range_reads_enabled' is performance-sensitive. This is because enabling this configuration adds overhead to range read operations by tracking repaired data and comparing results from multiple full replicas. The code snippet provided shows that the configuration directly affects the behavior of range read operations by checking if the flag is enabled and the number of full replicas to compare results from. This additional tracking and comparison can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, especially when there are many range read operations with multiple full replicas. Therefore, the configuration is considered performance-sensitive due to its direct and substantial impact on system performance."
