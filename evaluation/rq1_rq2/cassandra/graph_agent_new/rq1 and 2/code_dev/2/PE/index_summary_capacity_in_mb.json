    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'index_summary_capacity_in_mb' configuration option is performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly impacts the memory usage of SSTable index summaries, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The code snippet provided initializes the IndexSummaryManager by setting the memory pool size based on the value retrieved from DatabaseDescriptor. This memory pool size directly affects the amount of memory available for index summaries, which can have a significant impact on system performance, especially in extreme conditions where Cassandra may need to use more memory than specified in this configuration."
