    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'concurrent_materialized_view_builders' is performance-sensitive. This is because the number of simultaneous materialized view builder tasks allowed directly impacts the system's performance by affecting parallelism in building materialized views. The code context shows that this configuration is used to manage compaction tasks, which are time-expensive operations. Setting a higher value can increase parallelism but may also increase resource consumption, while setting a lower value may reduce resource consumption but could potentially slow down the materialized view building process. Therefore, the configuration has a direct and substantial effect on system performance at the system level."
