    "classification_result": "Performance-insensitive with 100% confidence",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'Row cache implementation class name' is related to the type of row cache implementation in Cassandra. This configuration option does not directly impact system performance as it only specifies the implementation class name for the row cache. Different implementations may have slight differences in performance, but the choice of implementation itself is not a performance-sensitive operation."
