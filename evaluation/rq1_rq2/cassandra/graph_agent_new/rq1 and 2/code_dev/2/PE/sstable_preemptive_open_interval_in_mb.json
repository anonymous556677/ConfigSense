    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'sstable_preemptive_open_interval_in_mb' is performance-sensitive. The code context shows that this configuration directly affects the interval at which replacement sstables are opened during compaction, which can have a significant impact on the performance of compaction and read operations. By adjusting this interval, it can influence the efficiency of data transfer between sstables, reduce page cache churn, and improve overall system performance. Therefore, any changes to this configuration can lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
