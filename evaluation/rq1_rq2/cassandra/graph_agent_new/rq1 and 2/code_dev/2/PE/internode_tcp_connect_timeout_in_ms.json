{
    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'internode_tcp_connect_timeout_in_ms' is classified as performance-sensitive. This is because the 'tcpConnectTimeoutInMS()' method directly impacts the system performance by determining the amount of time to wait for internode TCP connections to establish. This configuration involves time-expensive operations related to establishing network connections, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Additionally, the developer's understanding on the size impact of this configuration further confirms its performance sensitivity."
