    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'cdc_total_space_in_mb' is performance-sensitive. The code snippet provided shows that this configuration directly impacts the total space available for change-data-capture logs on disk, which can have a significant effect on system performance. The developer's explanation also highlights that exceeding the specified total space limit can lead to WriteTimeoutException on Mutations, affecting system performance and reliability. Therefore, the configuration involves performance-related operations that are memory-expensive and can cause notable performance variations at the system level."
