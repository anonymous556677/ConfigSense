    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The 'batch_size_fail_threshold_in_kb' configuration is not performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the configuration is used to determine a threshold at which a multiple-partition batch will fail, but it does not involve any performance-related operations that are time-extensive or memory-extensive within its related code. The configuration itself does not directly and substantially affect system performance at the system level, as it is more focused on maintaining system stability and preventing issues rather than causing notable performance variations."
