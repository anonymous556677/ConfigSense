    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'internode_application_receive_queue_reserve_global_capacity_in_bytes' is classified as performance-sensitive. This is because the setting directly impacts the maximum size of messages that can be queued for delivery between nodes in the cluster, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The code context provided does not directly show the performance impact, but the developer's explanation highlights the potential memory usage and performance issues that can arise from setting this value too high. Therefore, the configuration involves performance-related operations that are memory-expensive and can have a significant impact on system performance."
