    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'internode_application_receive_queue_reserve_endpoint_capacity_in_bytes' is performance-sensitive. This is because it directly impacts the memory consumption of the system by setting the limit on the size of messages queued for delivery to other nodes and waiting to be processed on arrival from other nodes in the cluster. The code context reveals that this configuration affects the allocation of memory for message queues per endpoint in internode communication, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level based on the volume of internode communication happening in the system."
