{
    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'transparent_data_encryption_options' is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the configuration directly impacts system performance by introducing encryption and decryption operations for data at-rest. The code context provided includes operations for creating encryption components, handling encryption, and decryption, which are time-expensive and memory-expensive operations. These operations can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, especially when dealing with large datasets. Therefore, the configuration is considered performance-sensitive based on the code analysis and its impact on system performance."
