    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'max_value_size_in_mb' configuration is performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly impacts the system performance at the system level by limiting the maximum size of values in SSTables. The code snippets related to this configuration involve time-expensive operations such as reading values from the input stream and checking against the configured threshold. If the value size exceeds the threshold, it can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, affecting data integrity and potentially causing system issues."
