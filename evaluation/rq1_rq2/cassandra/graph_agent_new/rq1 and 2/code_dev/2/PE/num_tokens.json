    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'num_tokens' configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the distribution of data across the cluster, affecting the load balancing and efficiency of data retrieval operations. The code related to 'num_tokens' involves operations that determine the number of tokens assigned to the node, which in turn affects the data distribution strategy and replication factor. Any changes to this configuration can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, especially in terms of data distribution and read/write operations efficiency."
