    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The 'corrupted_tombstone_strategy' configuration does not involve any performance-sensitive operations that significantly impact system performance at the system level. The code related to this configuration mainly handles invalid tombstones based on the strategy set in the configuration. While the configuration may have an impact on the system behavior and data integrity, it does not directly contribute to notable performance variations in terms of time-expensive or memory-expensive operations. The operations triggered by this configuration are more focused on data validation and error handling rather than performance optimization or resource-intensive tasks."
