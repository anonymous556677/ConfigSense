    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'row_cache_size_in_mb' configuration is performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly impacts the memory usage of the system by setting the maximum size of the row cache in memory. The code snippets provided show that the configuration value is used to calculate the capacity of the row cache, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Additionally, setting a higher value for this configuration can result in increased memory consumption, potentially affecting system performance. Therefore, the configuration involves performance-related operations that are memory-expensive and can have a significant impact on system performance."
