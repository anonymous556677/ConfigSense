    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'internode_application_receive_queue_capacity_in_bytes' is performance-sensitive. This is because it directly affects the memory utilization of the system at the system level. By setting a limit on the application receive queue capacity, the configuration ensures that memory usage is controlled and prevents overwhelming a host with enqueued, undelivered messages on heap. This can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, making it a performance-sensitive configuration."
