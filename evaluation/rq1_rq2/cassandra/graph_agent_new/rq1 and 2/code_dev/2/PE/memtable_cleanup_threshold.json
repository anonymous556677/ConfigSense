    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The memtable_cleanup_threshold configuration is performance-sensitive. This is because the value of memtable_cleanup_threshold directly impacts the triggering of flushing the largest memtable, which is a time-expensive operation. The configuration-related code snippet shows that the cleaningThreshold is used to determine when to trigger the flush of the largest memtable based on the ratio of occupied non-flushing memtable size to total permitted size. This operation has a notable performance variation at the system level as it affects the efficiency of handling write loads and disk utilization. Therefore, the configuration is considered performance-sensitive."
