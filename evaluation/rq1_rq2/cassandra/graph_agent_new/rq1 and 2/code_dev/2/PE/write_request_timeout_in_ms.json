{
    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'write_request_timeout_in_ms' is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the configuration directly affects the timeout for write operations in the system. The timeout for write requests is crucial for system performance, as it determines how long the coordinator should wait for writes to complete. This directly impacts the execution time of write operations and can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The configuration-related code context shows that the 'write_request_timeout_in_ms' is used in various methods to calculate timeouts for write operations, indicating its significance in performance optimization."
