    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'concurrent_counter_writes' configuration is performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly impacts the number of striped cell-level locks acquired for concurrent counter writes, which can significantly affect system performance. The code context shows that the configuration value is multiplied by 1024 to set the number of locks, indicating that it has the potential to cause notable performance variations at the system level during counter mutation operations."
