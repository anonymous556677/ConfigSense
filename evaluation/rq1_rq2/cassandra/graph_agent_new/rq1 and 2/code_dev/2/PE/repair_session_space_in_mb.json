    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'repair_session_space_in_mb' configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly affects the memory usage during repair operations at the system level. The configuration is used to calculate the available space for holding RF trees in memory, which can have a notable impact on system performance. In the code context provided, the configuration is used to determine the available bytes for Merkle tree calculations, which are memory-expensive operations. Adjusting this configuration can lead to significant performance variations by controlling the memory allocation for these operations, making it a performance-sensitive configuration."
