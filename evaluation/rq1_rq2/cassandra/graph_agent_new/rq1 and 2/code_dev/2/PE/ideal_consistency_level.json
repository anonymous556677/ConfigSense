    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'ideal_consistency_level' configuration is performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly impacts the performance of each write operation by adding additional tracking and comparison logic to determine if the ideal consistency level is achieved. This additional logic can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, especially for write operations that require comparing the requested consistency level with the ideal consistency level. The configuration involves performance-related operations that are time-expensive and memory-expensive, making it performance-sensitive."
