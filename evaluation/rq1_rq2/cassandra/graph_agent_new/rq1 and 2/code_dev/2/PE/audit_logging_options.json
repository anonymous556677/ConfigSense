    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'audit_logging_options' configuration is performance-sensitive. This is because enabling audit logging adds overhead for logging every incoming CQL command request and authentication, which can significantly impact system performance and resource usage. The code snippets related to this configuration involve operations that are time-expensive, such as creating audit loggers, initializing audit logging options, and enabling audit logging with specific parameters. These operations can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, making the configuration performance-sensitive."
