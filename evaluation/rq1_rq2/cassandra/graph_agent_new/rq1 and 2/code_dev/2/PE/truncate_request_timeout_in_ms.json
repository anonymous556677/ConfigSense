    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'truncate_request_timeout_in_ms' configuration is performance-sensitive. The configuration directly affects the timeout for truncating operations, which can have a notable impact on system performance. The code related to this configuration involves time-expensive operations such as calculating timeout values and handling timeout exceptions. Any changes to this configuration can lead to significant performance variations at the system level, making it a performance-sensitive configuration."
