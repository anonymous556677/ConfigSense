    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'memtable_heap_space_in_mb' configuration is considered performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly impacts the total memory allocated for memtables in the system, which can significantly affect the system's performance. The code snippet provided shows that the configuration value is used to set limits and cleaning thresholds for the MemtablePool based on the allocation type. If the configured limit is too low, it can lead to frequent flushes and impact performance. Conversely, setting a high limit can increase memory usage and potentially cause out-of-memory errors. Therefore, any changes to this configuration can have notable performance variations at the system level."
