    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'tombstone_warn_threshold' configuration is performance-sensitive. This is because it directly affects the warning threshold for tombstones in Cassandra, which can impact the performance and memory usage of the system. The configuration is used to control the number of tombstones scanned during read operations, which are time-expensive and memory-expensive operations. Adjusting this threshold can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, making it a performance-sensitive configuration."
