    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The 'partitioner' configuration is not performance-sensitive because it does not directly impact the performance of the system at the system level. While changing the partitioner can have a significant impact on data distribution and cluster behavior, it does not involve performance-related operations that are time-expensive or memory-expensive within its related code. The 'partitioner' configuration is more about data distribution and cluster topology rather than direct performance optimization."
