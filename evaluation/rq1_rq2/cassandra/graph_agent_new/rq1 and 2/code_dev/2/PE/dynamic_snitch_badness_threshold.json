    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'dynamic_snitch_badness_threshold' configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly affects the badness threshold for 'pinning' replicas to hosts, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The code context shows that this configuration involves updating scheduler tasks and applying configuration changes based on dynamic update intervals, reset intervals, and badness thresholds. These operations are time-expensive and memory-expensive, and they directly impact the system's performance by influencing replica selection and cache capacity. Therefore, the configuration is considered performance-sensitive."
