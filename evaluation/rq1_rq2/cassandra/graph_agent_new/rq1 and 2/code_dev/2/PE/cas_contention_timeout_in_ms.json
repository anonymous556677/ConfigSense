    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'cas_contention_timeout_in_ms' is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the configuration directly affects the timeout for retrying Paxos rounds during CAS operations. The code context shows that the timeout value obtained from this configuration impacts the frequency of retries and contention situations during CAS operations. The timeout value set by this configuration can lead to notable performance variations at the system level by influencing the duration of CAS operation retries, which are time-expensive and can affect system performance significantly."
