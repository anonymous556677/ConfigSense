    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option internode_application_send_queue_reserve_endpoint_capacity_in_bytes is performance-sensitive. This is because setting this value directly impacts the maximum number of messages that can be queued for delivery to other nodes without coordination, affecting the overall message processing and delivery performance in the system. The code context shows that this configuration involves fetching default values and updating the outbound connection settings based on the specified capacity limits, which can have a notable performance impact at the system level."
