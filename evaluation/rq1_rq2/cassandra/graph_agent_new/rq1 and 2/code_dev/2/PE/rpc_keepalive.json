    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option rpc_keepalive is performance-sensitive. The code snippet related to the rpc_keepalive configuration involves setting up a PipelineConfigurator with the value of DatabaseDescriptor.getRpcKeepAlive(), which directly impacts the keepalive setting on rpc/native connections. This setting can have a notable performance impact at the system level by affecting connection efficiency and resource usage. Enabling keepalive can improve performance by reducing connection setup overhead, but it may also increase resource consumption. Disabling keepalive may reduce resource usage but can lead to increased connection setup overhead, affecting system performance. Therefore, the configuration is considered performance-sensitive due to its direct and substantial impact on system performance through time-expensive and memory-expensive operations related to connection management."
