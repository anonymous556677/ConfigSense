    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option native_transport_idle_timeout_in_ms is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the idle timeout value directly affects the system performance by managing and controlling the number of idle client connections. The code snippet adds an IdleStateHandler to the ChannelPipeline, which closes idle client connections after the specified timeout period. This operation is time-expensive as it involves checking for idle connections and closing them, leading to notable performance variations at the system level."
