{
    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'cdc_free_space_check_interval_ms' configuration is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the configuration involves time-expensive operations related to space management for cdc-tracked tables. The code context shows that the configuration triggers a size recalculation process every 250 milliseconds, which involves file operations and directory size calculations. These operations directly impact system performance by consuming resources and can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, especially in scenarios where the system is under heavy load or experiencing backpressure due to space constraints."
