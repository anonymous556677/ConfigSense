    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The 'auto_snapshot' configuration option is not performance-sensitive. The code related to this configuration does not contain any performance-related operations that are time-expensive or memory-expensive. The main purpose of this configuration is to determine whether a snapshot is taken for data safety during keyspace truncation or dropping of column families. While the configuration has a significant impact on data safety, it does not directly and substantially affect system performance at the system level. Therefore, it is not classified as performance-sensitive."
