{
    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'internode_tcp_user_timeout_in_ms' is classified as performance-sensitive. This is because the timeout value set by this configuration directly impacts the time taken for internode TCP connections to establish in Cassandra, which can significantly affect the overall system performance. The code snippet provided shows that the method 'tcpUserTimeoutInMS' is responsible for determining the timeout value based on the connection category, and if a specific timeout value is not set, it falls back to using values specified in the DatabaseDescriptor class. Since the establishment of TCP connections is a critical operation in a distributed system like Cassandra, any delay or inefficiency in this process can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Therefore, the 'internode_tcp_user_timeout_in_ms' configuration is considered performance-sensitive."
