    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The initial_token configuration is classified as performance-sensitive because it directly affects the token assignment for nodes in the cluster, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The code snippet shows that if initial tokens are provided, the code will use those tokens, potentially overriding automatic allocation. This can impact the distribution of data across cluster nodes and have a significant performance impact on the system. Additionally, the configuration involves performance-related operations such as token allocation algorithms and token generation, which are time-expensive and memory-expensive, further contributing to its performance sensitivity."
