    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'cross_node_timeout' configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly affects the calculation of expiration time for operations, which is a critical aspect of system performance. The code snippet provided shows that this configuration is checked in the getExpiresAtNanos method, and if it is disabled or if certain conditions are met, it can significantly impact the expiration time calculation. This can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, making it a performance-sensitive configuration."
