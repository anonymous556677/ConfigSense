    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'periodic_commitlog_sync_lag_block_in_ms' is performance-sensitive. The code context shows that this configuration directly impacts the waiting time for slow disk flushes during write operations. The calculation of 'blockWhenSyncLagsNanos' based on this configuration value indicates that it can lead to notable performance variations at the system level by potentially prolonging the blocking of write operations. This directly affects the system's performance by introducing delays in write operations, making it a performance-sensitive configuration."
