    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'internode_compression' configuration is performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly impacts the network traffic and CPU usage at the system level. Depending on the setting ('all' or 'dc'), it can significantly affect the performance by either compressing all traffic between nodes or only traffic between nodes in different datacenters. The code snippet provided also shows that the configuration is checked when establishing a connection between nodes, indicating that it can have notable performance variations based on the setting."
