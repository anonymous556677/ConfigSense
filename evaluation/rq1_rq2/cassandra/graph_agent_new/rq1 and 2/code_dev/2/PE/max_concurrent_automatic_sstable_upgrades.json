    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'max_concurrent_automatic_sstable_upgrades' configuration is performance-sensitive. This is because it directly impacts the system performance by controlling the maximum number of concurrent sstable upgrade tasks that can run automatically. The code snippet provided shows that this configuration is used to limit the number of upgrade tasks that can run concurrently, which can have a significant impact on system resources and performance. If this configuration is set too low, it may result in slower upgrades and potential performance issues, while setting it too high may overload the system with concurrent upgrade tasks, affecting system performance."
