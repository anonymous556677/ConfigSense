    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'allocate_tokens_for_keyspace' configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the token allocation strategy for new nodes joining the cluster, which can significantly affect the performance and load balancing of the system. The code context shows that the configuration involves time-expensive operations such as token allocation algorithms and random token selection, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Therefore, the configuration is considered performance-sensitive based on its code implementation and system-level impact."
