    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'streaming_keep_alive_period_in_secs' is performance-sensitive. This is because the value of this configuration directly impacts the frequency of keep-alive messages being sent between nodes, which can have a significant effect on system performance. The code context shows that this configuration is used to schedule a task that sends keep-alive messages at a fixed rate based on the value of 'keepAlivePeriod'. A shorter period may increase network traffic but ensure quicker detection of stalled streams, while a longer period may reduce network overhead but increase the time taken to detect stalled streams. Therefore, changes in this configuration can lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
