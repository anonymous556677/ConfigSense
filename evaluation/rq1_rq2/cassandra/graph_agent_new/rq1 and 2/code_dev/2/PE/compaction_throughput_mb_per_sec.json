    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'compaction_throughput_mb_per_sec' is performance-sensitive. This is because it directly impacts the rate at which compaction can occur across the entire system, affecting the overall system performance. The code context shows that this configuration is used to set the rate limiter for compaction, which involves time-expensive operations related to managing the compaction process. Any changes to this configuration can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, making it a performance-sensitive configuration."
