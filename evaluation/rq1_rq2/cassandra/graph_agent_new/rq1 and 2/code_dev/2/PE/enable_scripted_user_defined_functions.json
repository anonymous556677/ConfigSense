    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'enable_scripted_user_defined_functions' is performance-sensitive. This is because enabling this configuration directly affects the system performance by allowing the use of scripted user-defined functions, which can be time-expensive and memory-expensive operations. The code context shows that the configuration is checked in the assertUdfsEnabled method, which is triggered whenever this method is called in the system. Enabling scripted user-defined functions introduces flexibility but also security risks, impacting system performance depending on the extent of usage and security measures in place."
