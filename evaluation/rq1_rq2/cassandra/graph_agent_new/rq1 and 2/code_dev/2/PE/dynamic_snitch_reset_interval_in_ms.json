    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'dynamic_snitch_reset_interval_in_ms' is performance-sensitive. This is because the reset interval directly impacts the behavior of the endpoint snitch, affecting how often host scores are reset. The code initializes schedulers based on this interval, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. A longer reset interval may improve system performance by allowing bad hosts to recover, while a shorter interval may impact system behavior more frequently, affecting overall performance."
