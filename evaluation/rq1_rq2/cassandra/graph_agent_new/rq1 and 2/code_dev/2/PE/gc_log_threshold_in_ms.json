    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The 'gc_log_threshold_in_ms' configuration does not directly and substantially affect system performance at the system level. The code context provided does not contain any performance-intensive operations related to this configuration. The developer's explanation also indicates that this configuration mainly controls the amount of logging generated by the system based on GC pause times. While adjusting the threshold may impact the frequency of logging, it does not lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Therefore, based on the code context and developer's information, the 'gc_log_threshold_in_ms' configuration is classified as not performance-sensitive."
