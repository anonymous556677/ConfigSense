    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'commit_failure_policy' configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts system performance by determining the actions taken when a commit error occurs. Depending on the policy set, it can lead to significant performance variations such as node shutdown, JVM termination, or commit log shutdown. The code context shows that the configuration involves performance-related operations like stopping transports and killing the current JVM, which are time-expensive and memory-expensive operations. These operations can have a notable impact on system performance at the system level."
