    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'native_transport_max_threads' configuration is performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly impacts the maximum number of threads available for handling requests in the native transport layer. The code initializes an executor service based on this configuration value, which plays a crucial role in processing incoming requests efficiently. If this configuration is set too low, it can lead to bottlenecks and slow response times, especially under heavy load. Conversely, setting it too high can result in resource exhaustion and increased contention for system resources, affecting overall system performance significantly. Therefore, the 'native_transport_max_threads' configuration has a direct and substantial impact on system performance at the system level, making it performance-sensitive."
