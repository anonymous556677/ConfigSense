    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'cached_rows_warn_threshold' configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the resolution process by setting a threshold for warning when the number of rows fetched from replicas exceeds a certain limit. This limit affects the efficiency of the resolution process and can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The configuration is used in the ReplicaFilteringProtection class to ensure query results are accurate and up-to-date, making it crucial for maintaining system performance and consistency. Additionally, the configuration involves performance-related operations such as setting the threshold for warning, which can be time-expensive and memory-expensive, further indicating its performance sensitivity."
