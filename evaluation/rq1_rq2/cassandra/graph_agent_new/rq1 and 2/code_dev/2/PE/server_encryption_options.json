    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'server_encryption_options' configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the system's security and encryption settings for server-to-server communication. The configuration involves setting up SSL socket protocols and cipher suites, which are time-expensive and memory-expensive operations. Changing encryption options can significantly affect the system's performance at the system level by introducing notable performance variations due to the complexity and resource-intensive nature of encryption operations."
