    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The configuration 'commitlog_sync_period_in_ms' is used in the code to determine the periodic commit log sync block. If the 'periodic_commitlog_sync_lag_block_in_ms' is not set, it defaults to 1.5 times the commit log sync period.",

A longer period may result in less frequent syncs but potentially higher latency in data persistence, while a shorter period may increase the frequency of syncs but also increase system overhead."
