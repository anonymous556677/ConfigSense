    "config_description": "enable or disable keepalive on rpc/native connections",
    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The rpc_keepalive configuration in the code determines whether keepalive is enabled or disabled on rpc/native connections. It is used to control the behavior of the connections in terms of keepalive functionality.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The triggering frequency of the rpc_keepalive configuration in the system depends on the specific use case and the frequency of rpc/native connections being established and closed. If keepalive is enabled, the system will periodically send keepalive packets to maintain the connection. If keepalive is disabled, the system will not send keepalive packets.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the rpc_keepalive configuration option on the system is related to the management of connections. Enabling keepalive can help maintain connections and prevent them from being closed prematurely due to inactivity, which can improve performance and reduce connection setup overhead. However, enabling keepalive can also consume additional system resources for managing the keepalive packets."
