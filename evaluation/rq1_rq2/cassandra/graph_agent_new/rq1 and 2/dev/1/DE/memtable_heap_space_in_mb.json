    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The configuration 'memtable_heap_space_in_mb' is used to set the total permitted memory to use for memtables in the system. The code snippet provided shows how the value of this configuration is retrieved and used to create a MemtablePool based on the allocation type specified in DatabaseDescriptor.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The triggering frequency of the 'memtable_heap_space_in_mb' configuration depends on the memtable_cleanup_threshold value. When the total memory used by memtables exceeds the specified limit, Cassandra will stop accepting writes until a flush completes. The frequency of triggering a flush is based on the memtable_cleanup_threshold value.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the 'memtable_heap_space_in_mb' configuration option on the system is significant. If the configured memory limit is too low, Cassandra may stop accepting writes frequently, impacting the system's performance. On the other hand, setting a high memory limit may lead to increased memory usage and potential performance issues. It is crucial to configure this option carefully based on the system's requirements and available resources."
