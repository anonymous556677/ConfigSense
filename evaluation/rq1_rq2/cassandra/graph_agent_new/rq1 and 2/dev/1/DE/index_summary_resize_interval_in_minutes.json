Setting a higher value for 'index_summary_resize_interval_in_minutes' will result in less frequent resampling of index summaries, which may lead to inefficient memory allocation. On the other hand, setting a lower value will trigger more frequent resampling, potentially improving memory allocation efficiency but also increasing system overhead."
