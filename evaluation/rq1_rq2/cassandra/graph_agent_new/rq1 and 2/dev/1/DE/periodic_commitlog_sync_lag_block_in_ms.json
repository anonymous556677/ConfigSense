    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The 'periodic_commitlog_sync_lag_block_in_ms' configuration is used in the PeriodicCommitLogService class to determine the amount of time to block writes while waiting for a slow disk flush to complete. It calculates the expected sync time based on the current time and the configured block time, and if the last sync time is less than the expected sync time, it waits for the sync to complete.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The triggering frequency of the 'periodic_commitlog_sync_lag_block_in_ms' configuration depends on the frequency of disk flushes and the speed of the disk. If the disk flushes are slow and the block time is significant, this configuration will be triggered more frequently.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the 'periodic_commitlog_sync_lag_block_in_ms' configuration on the system is that it can potentially slow down the write operations when the disk flushes are slow. If the block time is too long, it can lead to increased latency in write operations and potentially impact the overall performance of the system."
