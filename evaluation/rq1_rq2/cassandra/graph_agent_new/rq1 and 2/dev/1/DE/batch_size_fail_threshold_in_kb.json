    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The configuration 'batch_size_fail_threshold_in_kb' is used to determine the threshold at which to fail any multiple-partition batch exceeding the specified value. It is retrieved using the method getBatchSizeFailureThreshold() which internally calls DatabaseDescriptor.getBatchSizeFailThresholdInKB().",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The triggering frequency of the 'batch_size_fail_threshold_in_kb' configuration depends on the batch size of multiple-partition batches being processed by the system. If a batch exceeds the specified threshold, the configuration will be triggered.",

By setting an appropriate threshold, the system can avoid processing excessively large batches that may lead to inefficiencies or errors."
