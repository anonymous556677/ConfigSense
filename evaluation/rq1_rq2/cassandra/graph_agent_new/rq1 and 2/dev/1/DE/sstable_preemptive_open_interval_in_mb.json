    "config_description": "When compacting, the replacement sstable(s) can be opened before they are completely written, and used in place of the prior sstables for any range that has been written. This helps to smoothly transfer reads between the sstables, reducing page cache churn and keeping hot rows hot",
    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The configuration 'sstable_preemptive_open_interval_in_mb' is used to calculate the open interval for replacement sstables when compacting. It determines whether the replacement sstable(s) should be opened early before they are completely written.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The triggering frequency of the configuration depends on the frequency of compacting operations in the system. If there are frequent compacting operations, the configuration will be triggered more often.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the 'sstable_preemptive_open_interval_in_mb' configuration is to help smoothly transfer reads between sstables during compaction, reducing page cache churn and keeping hot rows hot. It can improve performance by optimizing the way replacement sstables are opened and used."
