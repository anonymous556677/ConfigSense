    "config_description": "GC Pauses greater than gc_warn_threshold_in_ms will be logged at WARN level Adjust the threshold based on your application throughput requirement. Setting to 0 will deactivate the feature.",
    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The configuration 'gc_warn_threshold_in_ms' is used to set a threshold for garbage collection pauses. If the pause time exceeds this threshold, a log message will be generated at the WARN level. This allows developers to monitor and adjust the threshold based on the application's throughput requirements.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The configuration is triggered whenever a garbage collection pause occurs and the duration of the pause exceeds the specified threshold value of 'gc_warn_threshold_in_ms'. The frequency of triggering depends on the frequency and duration of garbage collection pauses in the system.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the 'gc_warn_threshold_in_ms' configuration option is that it can affect the system's performance and responsiveness. Setting a low threshold may result in frequent log messages and potentially impact the application's throughput. On the other hand, setting a high threshold may cause longer garbage collection pauses to go unnoticed, leading to potential performance issues. It is important to carefully tune this configuration based on the application's requirements and performance goals."
