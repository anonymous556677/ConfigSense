These limits are applied to the on-wire size of the message being sent or received.  The basic per-link limit is consumed in isolation before any endpoint or global limit is imposed. Each node-pair has three links: urgent, small and large.  So any given node may have a maximum of N*3*(internode_application_send_queue_capacity_in_bytes+internode_application_receive_queue_capacity_in_bytes) messages queued without any coordination between them although in practice, with token-aware routing, only RF*tokens nodes should need to communicate with significant bandwidth.  The per-endpoint limit is imposed on all messages exceeding the per-link limit, simultaneously with the global limit, on all links to or from a single node in the cluster. The global limit is imposed on all messages exceeding the per-link limit, simultaneously with the per-endpoint limit, on all links to or from any node in the cluster. ",

The method 'applicationSendQueueCapacityInBytes' returns the value of this configuration option if it is not null, otherwise it retrieves the value from the DatabaseDescriptor.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The triggering frequency of the 'internode_application_send_queue_capacity_in_bytes' configuration depends on the volume of messages being sent or received between nodes in the cluster. It is triggered whenever a message is queued for delivery or processed on arrival from other nodes.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The 'internode_application_send_queue_capacity_in_bytes' configuration option has a significant impact on the system's performance and resource utilization. Setting a higher value for this configuration can increase the amount of memory and network bandwidth consumed by queued messages, potentially leading to congestion and delays in message delivery. Conversely, setting a lower value can help prevent resource exhaustion but may also limit the system's ability to handle high message volumes efficiently."
