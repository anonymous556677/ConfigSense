This speeds up the network transfer significantly subject to throttling specified by stream_throughput_outbound_megabits_per_sec. Enabling this will reduce the GC pressure on sending and receiving node. When unset, the default is enabled. While this feature tries to keep the disks balanced, it cannot guarantee it. This feature will be automatically disabled if internode encryption is enabled.",
    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The configuration 'stream_entire_sstables' is checked in the computeShouldStreamEntireSSTables() method. It checks if full sstable transfers are enabled in DatabaseDescriptor and if there are no legacy counter shards present in the SSTable metadata. If both conditions are met, the method returns true, allowing the streaming of entire SSTables.",

This can reduce GC pressure on sending and receiving nodes. However, it may not guarantee disk balance and will be automatically disabled if internode encryption is enabled."
