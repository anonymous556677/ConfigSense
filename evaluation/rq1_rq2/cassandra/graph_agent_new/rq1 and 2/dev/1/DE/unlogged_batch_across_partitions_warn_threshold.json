The code checks if the batch is unlogged and has mutations for more than one partition. If so, it collects the partition keys and table names of the mutations. If the number of partition keys exceeds the threshold specified by 'UnloggedBatchAcrossPartitionsWarnThreshold', a warning is logged.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The triggering frequency of the 'unlogged_batch_across_partitions_warn_threshold' configuration depends on the number of unlogged batches that span across partitions and exceed the specified threshold. The frequency can vary based on the application's workload and the frequency of such batches being processed.",

By setting an appropriate threshold, the system can alert developers to investigate and optimize batch processing to avoid potential issues."
