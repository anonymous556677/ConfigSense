    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The 'memtable_offheap_space_in_mb' configuration is used to set the total permitted off-heap memory to use for memtables. In the code snippet provided, the offHeapLimit is calculated by shifting the value of 'memtable_offheap_space_in_mb' left by 20 bits, which effectively multiplies the value by 2^20 to convert it to bytes.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The triggering frequency of the 'memtable_offheap_space_in_mb' configuration depends on the memtable_cleanup_threshold set in the DatabaseDescriptor. When the off-heap memory limit set by 'memtable_offheap_space_in_mb' is exceeded, Cassandra will stop accepting writes until a flush completes. The frequency of triggering a flush is determined by the memtable_cleanup_threshold.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the 'memtable_offheap_space_in_mb' configuration option on the system is significant. If the off-heap memory limit set by this configuration is too low, it can lead to Cassandra stopping accepting writes until a flush completes, which can impact the system's availability and performance. It is important to set this configuration appropriately based on the system's requirements and available resources."
