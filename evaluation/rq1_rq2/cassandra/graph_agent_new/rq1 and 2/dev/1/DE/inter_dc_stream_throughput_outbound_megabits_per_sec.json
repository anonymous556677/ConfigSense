    "config_description": "Throttles all streaming file transfer between the datacenters, this setting allows users to throttle inter dc stream throughput in addition to throttling all network stream traffic as configured with stream_throughput_outbound_megabits_per_sec When unset, the default is 200 Mbps or 25 MB/s",
    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The configuration 'inter_dc_stream_throughput_outbound_megabits_per_sec' is used to throttle all streaming file transfer between the datacenters. It allows users to throttle inter dc stream throughput in addition to throttling all network stream traffic as configured with 'stream_throughput_outbound_megabits_per_sec'. The code provided includes methods to set and get the value of this configuration, as well as a method to calculate the rate in bytes based on the configured value.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The configuration is triggered whenever the 'setInterDCStreamThroughputMbPerSec' method is called to set a new value for the inter DC stream throughput. Additionally, the 'calculateInterDCRateInBytes' method calculates the rate in bytes based on the configured value.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the 'inter_dc_stream_throughput_outbound_megabits_per_sec' configuration option is that it controls the throttling of all streaming file transfer between the datacenters. Setting a lower value for this configuration will limit the inter DC stream throughput, potentially affecting the overall performance of data transfer between datacenters. On the other hand, setting a higher value may increase the throughput but could also lead to network congestion and performance issues."
