If disabled, replicas will assume that requests were forwarded to them instantly by the coordinator, which means that under overload conditions we will waste that much extra time processing already-timed-out requests.  Warning: It is generally assumed that users have setup NTP on their clusters, and that clocks are modestly in sync, since this is a requirement for general correctness of last write wins.",
    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The 'cross_node_timeout' configuration is checked in the getExpiresAtNanos method to determine if operation timeout information exchange between nodes should be enabled. If the configuration is disabled or if the createdAtNanos is greater than the currentTimeNanos, the createdAtNanos is set to the currentTimeNanos. The method then returns the sum of createdAtNanos and expirationPeriodNanos.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The triggering frequency of the 'cross_node_timeout' configuration in the system depends on the frequency of operations that involve cross-node communication and timeout measurement. If these operations are frequent, the configuration will be triggered more often.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the 'cross_node_timeout' configuration option is significant in ensuring accurate measurement of request timeouts between nodes. If disabled, replicas may incorrectly assume that requests were forwarded instantly, leading to wasted time processing already-timed-out requests under overload conditions. It is important for users to have NTP setup on their clusters and ensure clocks are in sync for the correctness of last write wins."
