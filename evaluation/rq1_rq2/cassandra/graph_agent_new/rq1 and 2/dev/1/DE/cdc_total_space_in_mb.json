If space gets above this value, Cassandra will throw WriteTimeoutException on Mutations including tables with CDC enabled. A CDCCompactor is responsible for parsing the raw CDC logs and deleting them when parsing is completed.  The default value is the min of 4096 mb and 1/8th of the total space of the drive where cdc_raw_directory resides.",
    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The configuration code 'cdc_total_space_in_mb' is used to determine the total space available for change-data-capture logs on disk. It retrieves the value set for CDC space in MB from the DatabaseDescriptor and multiplies it by 1024*1024 to convert it to bytes.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The triggering frequency of the 'cdc_total_space_in_mb' configuration is dependent on the space usage for change-data-capture logs on disk. When the space usage exceeds the configured total space, Cassandra will throw WriteTimeoutException on Mutations including tables with CDC enabled.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the 'cdc_total_space_in_mb' configuration option on the system is that it helps in managing the space allocated for change-data-capture logs. If the space allocated is not sufficient, it can lead to WriteTimeoutExceptions and affect the performance of the system."
