    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The configuration 'internode_compression' is used to determine whether traffic between nodes should be compressed. The function shouldCompressConnection checks if the internodeCompression setting in DatabaseDescriptor is set to 'all' or 'dc' and if the traffic should be compressed based on the local and remote hosts.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The triggering frequency of the 'internode_compression' configuration depends on the frequency of node-to-node communication in the system. If there is frequent communication between nodes, this configuration will be triggered more often.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the 'internode_compression' configuration option on the system is that it can reduce the amount of data transferred between nodes, leading to potential improvements in network performance and reduced bandwidth usage. However, enabling compression may also introduce additional CPU overhead for compressing and decompressing data."
