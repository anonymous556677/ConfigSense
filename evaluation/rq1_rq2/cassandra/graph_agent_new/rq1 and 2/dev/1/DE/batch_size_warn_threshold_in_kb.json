    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The configuration 'batch_size_warn_threshold_in_kb' is used to determine the threshold at which a WARN log message is triggered when a multiple-partition batch size exceeds the specified value. The method getBatchSizeWarnThreshold() returns the value of the configuration from the DatabaseDescriptor.",

This can potentially impact the system performance and stability, hence caution should be taken when modifying this configuration."
