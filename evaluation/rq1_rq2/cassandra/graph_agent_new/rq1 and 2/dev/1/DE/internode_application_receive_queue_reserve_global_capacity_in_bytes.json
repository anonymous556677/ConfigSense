    "config_description": "Global, per-endpoint and per-connection limits imposed on messages queued for delivery to other nodes and waiting to be processed on arrival from other nodes in the cluster.  These limits are applied to the on-wire size of the message being sent or received.  The basic per-link limit is consumed in isolation before any endpoint or global limit is imposed. Each node-pair has three links: urgent, small and large.  So any given node may have a maximum of N*3*(internode_application_send_queue_capacity_in_bytes+internode_application_receive_queue_capacity_in_bytes) messages queued without any coordination between them although in practice, with token-aware routing, only RF*tokens nodes should need to communicate with significant bandwidth.  The per-endpoint limit is imposed on all messages exceeding the per-link limit, simultaneously with the global limit, on all links to or from a single node in the cluster. The global limit is imposed on all messages exceeding the per-link limit, simultaneously with the per-endpoint limit, on all links to or from any node in the cluster.  internode_application_send_queue_capacity_in_bytes: 4194304                       #4MiB internode_application_send_queue_reserve_endpoint_capacity_in_bytes: 134217728    #128MiB internode_application_send_queue_reserve_global_capacity_in_bytes: 536870912      #512MiB internode_application_receive_queue_capacity_in_bytes: 4194304                    #4MiB internode_application_receive_queue_reserve_endpoint_capacity_in_bytes: 134217728 #128MiB",
    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The configuration 'internode_application_receive_queue_reserve_global_capacity_in_bytes' sets the global capacity in bytes for the receive queue of messages queued for delivery to other nodes and waiting to be processed on arrival. This limit is applied to the on-wire size of the message being received.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The configuration is triggered when messages are being received from other nodes in the cluster. The triggering frequency depends on the volume of incoming messages and the size of each message.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the 'internode_application_receive_queue_reserve_global_capacity_in_bytes' configuration option is significant as it determines the maximum amount of memory that can be allocated for incoming messages. If the configured capacity is too low, it may lead to message loss or delays in message processing. On the other hand, setting it too high may result in excessive memory usage and potential performance issues."
