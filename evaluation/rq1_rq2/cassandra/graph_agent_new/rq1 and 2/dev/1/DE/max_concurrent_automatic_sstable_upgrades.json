    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The configuration 'max_concurrent_automatic_sstable_upgrades' controls the maximum number of concurrent sstable upgrades that can be automatically triggered after an upgrade. The code snippet provided checks if there are upgrade tasks available and if the number of currently running upgrade tasks is less than or equal to the configured maximum concurrent auto upgrade tasks, it executes the upgrade task.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The configuration is triggered whenever the maybeRunUpgradeTask method is called and there are upgrade tasks available. The triggering frequency depends on the availability of upgrade tasks and the current number of running upgrade tasks.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the 'max_concurrent_automatic_sstable_upgrades' configuration option is that it limits the number of concurrent sstable upgrades that can be automatically triggered. This helps in controlling the system resources used for sstable upgrades and prevents resource exhaustion due to too many concurrent upgrades."
