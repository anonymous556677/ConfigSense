The method tcpUserTimeoutInMS() checks if the configuration value is set, and if not, it retrieves the value based on the connection category (messaging or streaming) from DatabaseDescriptor.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The triggering frequency of the 'internode_tcp_user_timeout_in_ms' configuration in the system depends on the frequency of establishing internode TCP connections.

Setting this value appropriately ensures that internode TCP connections are established within the specified time frame, preventing potential network issues. However, setting it too high may lead to longer connection establishment times and potential performance issues."
