If user-defined functions are disabled, any attempt to use them will result in an InvalidRequestException. Enabling user-defined functions may introduce security risks, as mentioned in the exception message. Therefore, the impact of this configuration option should be carefully considered based on the system's security requirements and potential risks associated with executing user-defined functions."
