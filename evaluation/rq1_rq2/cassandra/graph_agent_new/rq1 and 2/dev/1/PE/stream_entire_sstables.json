    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'stream_entire_sstables' configuration is performance-sensitive. This is because enabling this configuration allows for zero-copy streaming of entire SSTables between nodes, which significantly speeds up network transfer and reduces GC pressure. These performance-related operations directly impact system performance at the system level by improving data transfer efficiency and reducing resource consumption. The code context in the computeShouldStreamEntireSSTables() method also indicates that specific conditions need to be met for this configuration to be triggered, showing that it involves time-expensive operations that can lead to notable performance variations."
