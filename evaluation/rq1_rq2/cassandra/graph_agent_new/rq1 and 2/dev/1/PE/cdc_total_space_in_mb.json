    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'cdc_total_space_in_mb' configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the system performance by managing the space allocated for change-data-capture logs. Insufficient space allocation can lead to WriteTimeoutExceptions, affecting system performance. The code related to this configuration involves operations that are time-expensive, such as retrieving the value from DatabaseDescriptor and converting it to bytes, which can contribute significantly to execution time and memory consumption."
