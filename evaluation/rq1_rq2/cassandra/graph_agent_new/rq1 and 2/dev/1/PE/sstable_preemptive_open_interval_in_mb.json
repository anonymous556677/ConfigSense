    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'sstable_preemptive_open_interval_in_mb' is not performance-sensitive. Although it plays a role in optimizing the way replacement sstables are opened during compaction, the impact on system performance is not substantial enough to cause notable performance variations. The developer's explanation indicates that the configuration mainly helps in smooth read transfers between sstables and reducing page cache churn, which may have some performance benefits but does not directly lead to significant performance impacts at the system level. Additionally, the configuration is triggered based on the frequency of compacting operations, so its impact is more localized and does not have a broad system-wide performance effect."
