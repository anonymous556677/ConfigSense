    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'concurrent_materialized_view_builders' is performance-sensitive. This is because it directly impacts the number of simultaneous materialized view builder tasks allowed in the system, which can significantly affect system performance. The code related to this configuration involves operations that are time-expensive, as it sets and controls the number of concurrent view builders. If this configuration is not optimized correctly, it can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, either by slowing down the materialized view building process or causing resource contention and performance issues if set too high."
