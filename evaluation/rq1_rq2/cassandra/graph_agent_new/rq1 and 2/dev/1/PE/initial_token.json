    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The initial_token configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly affects the token assignment for nodes in the cluster, which can have a significant impact on the distribution of data across the cluster. This configuration involves performance-related operations that are time-expensive and memory-expensive within its related code, leading to notable performance variations at the system level. Manually specifying tokens or relying on allocationKeyspace and allocationLocalRf for token generation can have a substantial impact on system performance, especially in legacy clusters without vnodes enabled."
