    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'cross_node_timeout' configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts system performance by ensuring accurate measurement of request timeouts between nodes. The configuration involves time-expensive operations in the getExpiresAtNanos method, where it checks if operation timeout information exchange between nodes should be enabled and adjusts the createdAtNanos based on the currentTimeNanos. This can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, especially in scenarios where cross-node communication and timeout measurement operations are frequent. Disabling this configuration can result in wasted time processing already-timed-out requests under overload conditions, highlighting its importance for system performance."
