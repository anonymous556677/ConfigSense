    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'compaction_throughput_mb_per_sec' is performance-sensitive. This is because it directly impacts the rate of compaction in the system, which in turn affects the overall system performance. The configuration involves setting a rate limiter for compaction, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Additionally, the configuration involves time-expensive operations related to compaction, as setting it too low can result in slower compaction and potentially higher sstable count, while setting it too high can lead to unnecessary throttling and resource wastage."
