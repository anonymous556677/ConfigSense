    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'file_cache_enabled' configuration option is performance-sensitive. From the system level perspective, enabling this configuration impacts the system by storing recently accessed sections of the sstable in-memory as uncompressed buffers, which can significantly improve read performance by reducing the need to read data from disk. From the configuration-related code perspective, the code snippet related to this configuration involves operations that are time-expensive (checking the flag and calculating cache size) and memory-expensive (creating an instance of ChunkCache or setting it to null), leading to notable performance variations at the system level."
