    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'disk_failure_policy' configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly and substantially affects system performance at the system level. The different policies such as 'die', 'stop_paranoid', 'stop', 'best_effort', and 'ignore' have significant impacts on the system's behavior and availability. Depending on the chosen policy, the configuration can result in shutting down gossip and client transports, killing the JVM, stopping certain operations, responding with obsolete data, or ignoring fatal errors. These operations are time-expensive and memory-expensive, leading to notable performance variations at the system level."
