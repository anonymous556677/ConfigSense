    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'key_cache_size_in_mb' configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts system performance by affecting the efficiency of key cache operations. The code initializes a key cache with the specified capacity, and the size of the key cache can significantly impact performance by reducing the number of seeks required for cache hits. This configuration involves memory-expensive operations as it can consume a significant amount of memory if set to a very large size. Additionally, not setting an optimal size for the key cache can negatively affect performance by not loading all the hottest keys on startup. Therefore, the 'key_cache_size_in_mb' configuration is considered performance-sensitive due to its direct and substantial impact on system performance at the system level."
