{
    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'enable_sasi_indexes' is classified as performance-sensitive. Enabling SASI indexes through this configuration can have a substantial impact on system performance and resource usage. SASI indexes are known to be time-expensive and memory-expensive operations, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Additionally, the developer's information indicates that enabling SASI indexes is crucial for proper functionality, and the triggering frequency of this configuration suggests that it directly affects the system performance when creating or updating indexes in the Cassandra database schema. Therefore, based on the code context and provided information, it is evident that the 'enable_sasi_indexes' configuration is performance-sensitive."
