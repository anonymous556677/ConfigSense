    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'native_transport_flush_in_batches_legacy' is performance-sensitive because it directly affects the throughput of the system, especially for systems with old kernels or very few client connections. The code context indicates that this configuration option determines whether to use native transport TCP message coalescing, which can have a significant impact on execution time and memory consumption. Therefore, it meets the criteria of directly and substantially affecting system performance at the system level, leading to notable performance variations."
