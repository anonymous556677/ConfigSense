    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'allocate_tokens_for_keyspace' configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the token allocation strategy for new nodes joining the cluster, which in turn affects the distribution of data across the cluster and can impact performance and load balancing. The code related to this configuration involves operations that are time-expensive (such as generating suitable tokens using an algorithm) and memory-expensive (such as choosing num_tokens at random), leading to notable performance variations at the system level."
