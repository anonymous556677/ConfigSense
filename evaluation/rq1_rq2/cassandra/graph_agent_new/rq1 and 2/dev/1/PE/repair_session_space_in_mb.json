    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'repair_session_space_in_mb' is performance-sensitive. This is because it directly affects memory usage during repair operations, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The configuration involves time-expensive operations related to Merkle tree calculations, which are crucial for repair operations in Cassandra. The tradeoff between memory usage and data streaming efficiency highlights the significant impact of this configuration on system performance."
