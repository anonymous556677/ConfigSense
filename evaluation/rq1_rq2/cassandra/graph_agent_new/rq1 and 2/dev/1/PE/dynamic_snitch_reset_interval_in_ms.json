    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The dynamic_snitch_reset_interval_in_ms configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts system performance by affecting the frequency at which host scores are reset. This can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, as a shorter interval may result in more frequent score resets, potentially improving system performance by allowing bad hosts to recover faster. Conversely, a longer interval may delay the recovery process for bad hosts, impacting system performance negatively. The configuration-related code snippet provided shows that the configuration value is read from DatabaseDescriptor and used to schedule tasks that reset host scores at the specified interval, indicating that it involves performance-related operations that contribute to execution time and memory consumption."
