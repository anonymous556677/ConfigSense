    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'truncate_request_timeout_in_ms' configuration option is performance-sensitive. This is because the timeout value set by this configuration directly impacts the execution time of truncate operations at the system level. If the timeout value is too low, it may lead to premature timeout exceptions, affecting system performance. On the other hand, if the timeout value is too high, it may delay the completion of truncates, also impacting system performance. Additionally, the code uses this configuration to calculate the timeout for truncates and handle timeout exceptions, indicating that it involves time-expensive operations related to performance."
