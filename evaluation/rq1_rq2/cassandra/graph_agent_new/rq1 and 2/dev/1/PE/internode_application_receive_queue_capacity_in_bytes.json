    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'internode_application_receive_queue_capacity_in_bytes' is not performance-sensitive. Although it controls the maximum capacity for the application receive queue, it does not directly involve any time-extensive or memory-extensive operations within its related code. The configuration simply sets a limit on the size of messages queued for processing upon arrival from other nodes in the cluster, without causing notable performance variations at the system level. Therefore, it does not have a substantial impact on system performance."
