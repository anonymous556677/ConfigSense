    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'networking_cache_size_in_mb' configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly affects the maximum memory allocated for networking buffers, which can have a significant impact on system performance. Since networking operations can be time-expensive and memory-expensive, setting this configuration too low may lead to performance degradation due to insufficient memory for networking operations, while setting it too high may result in excessive memory usage. Therefore, any changes to this configuration can lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
