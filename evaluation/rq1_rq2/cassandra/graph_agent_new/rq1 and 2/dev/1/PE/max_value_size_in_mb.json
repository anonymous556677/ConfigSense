    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'max_value_size_in_mb' configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the system's performance at the system level. The configuration is triggered frequently whenever a new value is read or deserialized from the SSTables, which can lead to notable performance variations. Additionally, the configuration involves time-extensive operations to limit the size of values in SSTables, which contributes to the overall execution time and memory consumption of the system."
