    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'tracetype_repair_ttl' configuration is considered performance-sensitive because it directly impacts system performance by affecting memory consumption. Setting a higher TTL value for repair tracing sessions will consume more memory to store tracing data for a longer period, potentially leading to memory-intensive operations. This can result in notable performance variations at the system level, especially if there are frequent repair tasks triggering the configuration. Therefore, the configuration involves memory-expensive operations that can significantly impact system performance."
