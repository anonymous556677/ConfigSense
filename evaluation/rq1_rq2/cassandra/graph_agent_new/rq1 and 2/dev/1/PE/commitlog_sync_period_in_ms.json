    "Reason": "The 'commitlog_sync_period_in_ms' configuration option is not performance-sensitive. Although it affects the frequency at which the commit log is synced to disk, it does not directly involve any time-extensive or memory-extensive operations within its related code. The developer's explanation also indicates that the impact of this configuration is more related to data persistence latency and system overhead, rather than causing notable performance variations at the system level."
