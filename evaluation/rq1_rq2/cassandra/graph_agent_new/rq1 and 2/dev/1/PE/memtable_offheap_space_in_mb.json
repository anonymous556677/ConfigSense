    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'memtable_offheap_space_in_mb' configuration is performance-sensitive. The calculation of the offHeapLimit by shifting the value left by 20 bits indicates that this configuration directly impacts the amount of off-heap memory allocated for memtables, which can have a significant effect on system performance. If the off-heap memory limit set by this configuration is too low, it can lead to Cassandra stopping accepting writes until a flush completes, causing notable performance variations at the system level."
