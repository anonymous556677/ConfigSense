    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option internode_streaming_tcp_user_timeout_in_ms is performance-sensitive. This is because the timeout value directly impacts the latency of processing incoming stream messages, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. If the configured timeout is too low, it may result in premature closing of connections, affecting system performance. Additionally, the code snippet checking the latency against the timeout value is a time-expensive operation, further emphasizing the performance sensitivity of this configuration."
