    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The 'commit_failure_policy' configuration option does not involve any performance-related operations that are time-extensive or memory-extensive within its related code. While the configuration may have a significant impact on system availability and reliability, it does not directly and substantially affect system performance at the system level in terms of execution time or memory consumption. Therefore, it is not classified as performance-sensitive."
