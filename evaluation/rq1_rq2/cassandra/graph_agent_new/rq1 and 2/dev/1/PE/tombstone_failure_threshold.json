    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'tombstone_failure_threshold' is performance-sensitive. This is because it directly affects the execution time and memory consumption at the system level. The 'getTombstoneFailureThreshold' method is called whenever the tombstone failure threshold value is needed in the code, indicating that it is a critical parameter for the application. The impact of this configuration on the size of tombstones scanned in a query can lead to significant performance variations, as exceeding the threshold can result in a TombstoneOverwhelmingException being thrown, affecting the execution of the query. Therefore, the configuration 'tombstone_failure_threshold' involves performance-related operations that are time-expensive and memory-expensive, leading to notable performance variations at the system level."
