    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'cdc_free_space_check_interval_ms' does not directly and substantially affect system performance at the system level. Although it may impact the frequency at which the system checks for available space for cdc-tracked tables, the default interval of 250ms is not significantly time-expensive or memory-expensive. The code related to this configuration does not involve any performance-related operations that lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Therefore, it is classified as not performance-sensitive."
