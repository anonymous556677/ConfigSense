    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'key_cache_keys_to_save' configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts system performance and memory usage. Disabling this configuration would result in saving all keys from the key cache, potentially leading to increased memory consumption and slower cache saves at the system level. The configuration involves performance-related operations that are memory-extensive within its related code, which can cause notable performance variations."
