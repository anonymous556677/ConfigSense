    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'internode_authenticator' does not involve any performance-related operations that are time-extensive or memory-extensive within its related code. While it has a significant impact on system security and authentication mechanisms, it does not directly and substantially affect system performance at the system level in terms of performance variations. The triggering frequency of the configuration is dependent on changes to the configuration or system initialization, which does not lead to notable performance variations."
