    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'diagnostic_events_enabled' is classified as performance-sensitive. This is because enabling or disabling diagnostic events directly impacts the system performance at the system level. When diagnostic events are enabled, it introduces overhead in terms of processing and storage for handling these events, which can lead to notable performance variations. Additionally, the code snippets that check the 'diagnostic_events_enabled' configuration, such as 'isEnabled' and 'isDiagnosticsEnabled', contribute to execution time and memory consumption, making it a performance-sensitive configuration."
