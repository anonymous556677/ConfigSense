    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'column_index_cache_size_in_kb' is performance-sensitive. This is because it directly affects the amount of memory used for holding indexed key cache entries, leading to potential increased disk reads for index entries. The configuration involves memory-expensive operations that can have a notable performance impact at the system level, making it performance-sensitive."
