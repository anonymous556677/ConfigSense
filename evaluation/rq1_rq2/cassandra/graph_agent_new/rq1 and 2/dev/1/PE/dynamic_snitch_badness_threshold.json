    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'dynamic_snitch_badness_threshold' configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly affects the performance and load balancing of the system at the system level. The configuration controls how much worse a pinned host has to be before the dynamic snitch will prefer other replicas over it, which can lead to notable performance variations. Additionally, the configuration involves performance-related operations such as updating the dynamicUpdateInterval, dynamicResetInterval, and dynamicBadnessThreshold, which are time-expensive and memory-expensive operations that contribute to significant performance impacts."
