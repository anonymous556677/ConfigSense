    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'index_summary_resize_interval_in_minutes' is performance-sensitive. This is because the frequency of resampling index summaries directly impacts memory allocation efficiency at the system level. The code context related to this configuration involves time-expensive operations that redistribute memory based on recent read rates. Setting a higher value for this configuration can lead to inefficient memory allocation, while setting a lower value can improve memory allocation efficiency but increase system overhead. Therefore, the configuration directly and substantially affects system performance by influencing memory consumption, making it performance-sensitive."
