    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'keyspace_count_warn_threshold' configuration is considered performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the performance of schema-dependent cluster operations. Having a large number of keyspaces can significantly slow down these operations, and setting an appropriate threshold for the keyspace count can help in maintaining optimal performance. The configuration involves performance-related operations that are time-expensive, as it checks the keyspace count and logs a warning message if the threshold is exceeded. This can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, making it a performance-sensitive configuration."
