    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'range_request_timeout_in_ms' configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the system's performance at the system level. The configuration involves setting a timeout value for range RPC operations, which are time-expensive operations. If the timeout value is set too low, it may result in timeouts for long-running range scans, affecting system performance. On the other hand, setting it too high may increase the overall latency of range RPC operations, also impacting system performance. Therefore, the configuration's impact on system performance is notable and substantial, making it performance-sensitive."
