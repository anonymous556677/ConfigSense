    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'inter_dc_tcp_nodelay' is classified as performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly impacts the network communication behavior between data centers, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The code snippet related to this configuration involves checking and setting the tcpNoDelay flag, which can significantly affect the latency and overhead of network packets being sent. Enabling or disabling tcp_nodelay for inter-dc communication can have a substantial impact on the system's performance, making it a performance-sensitive configuration."
