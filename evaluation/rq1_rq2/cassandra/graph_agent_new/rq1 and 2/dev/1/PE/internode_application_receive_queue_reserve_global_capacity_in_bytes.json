    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'internode_application_receive_queue_reserve_global_capacity_in_bytes' is considered performance-sensitive. This is because the setting directly impacts the memory allocation for incoming messages, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The configuration involves memory-expensive operations related to message processing, and setting it too low can result in message loss or delays, while setting it too high can lead to excessive memory usage and potential performance issues. Therefore, the configuration has a direct and substantial effect on system performance, making it performance-sensitive."
