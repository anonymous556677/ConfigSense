    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The audit_logging_options configuration is classified as performance-sensitive because it directly impacts system performance by adding overhead for logging every incoming CQL command request and authentication. This can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, especially when a large volume of requests is being logged. The configuration involves performance-related operations that are time-expensive (logging requests) and memory-expensive (storing logs), which contribute significantly to execution time and memory consumption. Therefore, the configuration is considered performance-sensitive based on its impact on system performance and resource utilization."
