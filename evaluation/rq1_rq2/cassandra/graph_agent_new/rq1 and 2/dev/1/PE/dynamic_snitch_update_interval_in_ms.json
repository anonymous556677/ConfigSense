    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'dynamic_snitch_update_interval_in_ms' is performance-sensitive. This is because it directly controls the frequency of the more expensive part of host score calculation in the code. Changing this interval can have a notable impact on the performance of the system by adjusting how often the dynamic snitch updates its scores and resets bad hosts. The configuration involves performance-related operations that are time-expensive within its related code, leading to significant performance variations at the system level."
