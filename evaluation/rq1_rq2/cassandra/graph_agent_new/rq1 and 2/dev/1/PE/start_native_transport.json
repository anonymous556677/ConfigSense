    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'start_native_transport' configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts system performance at the system level by determining whether the native transport server is started or not. This operation involves starting the native transport server, which can significantly affect network communication and performance depending on the workload and client connections. The code snippet related to this configuration checks the system property 'cassandra.start_native_transport' and the return value of the DatabaseDescriptor.startNativeTransport() method to decide whether to start the native transport server. This decision-making process involves time-expensive operations and can lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
