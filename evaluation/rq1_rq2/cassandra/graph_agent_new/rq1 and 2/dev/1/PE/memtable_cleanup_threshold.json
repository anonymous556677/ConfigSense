    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The memtable_cleanup_threshold configuration is performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly impacts the triggering of flushes for the largest memtable based on the ratio of occupied non-flushing memtable size to total permitted size. This operation is time-expensive and memory-expensive as it affects the allocation and deallocation of memory resources. Additionally, the configuration has a significant impact on system performance by influencing the frequency and size of flushes, which can affect disk utilization and concurrent flush activity. Therefore, the configuration meets the criteria of directly and substantially affecting system performance at the system level, making it performance-sensitive."
