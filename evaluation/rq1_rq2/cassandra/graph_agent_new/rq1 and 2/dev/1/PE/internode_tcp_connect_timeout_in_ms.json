    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'internode_tcp_connect_timeout_in_ms' is classified as performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly impacts the system performance by setting the amount of time to wait for internode tcp connections to establish, which is crucial for protecting Cassandra from true network partitions. Additionally, the developer's information indicates that the configuration involves time-expensive operations related to tcp connection timeouts, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
