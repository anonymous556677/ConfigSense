    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'counter_cache_size_in_mb' configuration is classified as performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly impacts the system performance by determining the maximum size of the counter cache in memory. The size of the counter cache can significantly affect the system's performance by reducing contention for hot counter cells and improving overall performance. Additionally, the configuration involves time-extensive operations related to initializing the counter cache with the specified capacity in MBs, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
