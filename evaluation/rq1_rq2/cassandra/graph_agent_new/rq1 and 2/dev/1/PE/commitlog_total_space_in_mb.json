    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'commitlog_total_space_in_mb' configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts system performance by determining the total space available for commit logs on disk. The unusedCapacity() method, triggered by this configuration, involves time-expensive calculations to determine the unused capacity of the commit log. If the total space specified is too small, it can lead to more frequent flush activities on less-active column families, affecting system performance. Therefore, this configuration has notable performance variations at the system level."
