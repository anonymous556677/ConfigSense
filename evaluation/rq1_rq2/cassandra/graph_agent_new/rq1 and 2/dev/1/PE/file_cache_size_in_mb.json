    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'file_cache_size_in_mb' configuration is performance-sensitive. This is because it directly determines the maximum memory allocation for sstable chunk cache and buffer pooling, which are critical for system performance. The configuration involves time-extensive and memory-extensive operations within the code, impacting the system's efficiency and memory usage. Any changes to this configuration can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, making it a crucial factor in system performance."
