    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'native_transport_max_threads' configuration is classified as performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the concurrency and performance of handling transport requests at the system level. The configuration involves setting the maximum number of threads for handling requests in the native transport, which can significantly affect the system's ability to process incoming requests efficiently. If this configuration is not optimized correctly, it can lead to performance bottlenecks or resource exhaustion, making it crucial to tune based on workload and system resources. Additionally, the configuration involves time-expensive operations related to thread management and request handling, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
