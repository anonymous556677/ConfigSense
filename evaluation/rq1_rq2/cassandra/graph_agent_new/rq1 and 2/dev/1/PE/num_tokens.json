    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'num_tokens' configuration is classified as performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the distribution of data across the cluster, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The configuration involves assigning tokens to nodes on the ring, which affects data storage proportions and data balance. Setting a higher number of tokens can result in uneven data distribution if not all nodes have the same number of tokens, impacting system performance. Additionally, the configuration is triggered during system startup or when a node joins the ring, indicating its importance in system performance. Therefore, the 'num_tokens' configuration involves performance-related operations that are time-expensive and memory-expensive, leading to significant performance impacts at the system level."
