    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The 'auto_snapshot' configuration does not involve any performance-related operations that are time-extensive or memory-extensive within its related code. It is primarily focused on data safety by taking a snapshot before keyspace truncation or dropping of column families. While data safety is important for system reliability, this configuration does not directly and substantially affect system performance at the system level in terms of performance variations. Therefore, it is classified as not performance-sensitive."
