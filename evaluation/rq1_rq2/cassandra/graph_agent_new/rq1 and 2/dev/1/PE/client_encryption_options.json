    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'client_encryption_options' is performance-sensitive. The configuration directly impacts system performance by enabling encryption for CQL connections between clients and servers. This involves time-expensive SSL/TLS operations that add overhead in terms of processing and memory usage. The configuration code sets up client-to-server encryption, creates SSL contexts, and adds handlers to the channel pipeline, all of which contribute to notable performance variations at the system level."
