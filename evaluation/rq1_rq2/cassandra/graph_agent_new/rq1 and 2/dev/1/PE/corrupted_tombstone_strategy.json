    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The 'corrupted_tombstone_strategy' configuration does not involve any performance-related operations that are time-extensive or memory-extensive within its related code. While the configuration has a significant impact on data integrity and system stability, it does not directly lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Therefore, it is not classified as performance-sensitive."
