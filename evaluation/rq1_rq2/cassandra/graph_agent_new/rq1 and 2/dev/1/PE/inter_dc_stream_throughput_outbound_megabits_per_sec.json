    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'inter_dc_stream_throughput_outbound_megabits_per_sec' is performance-sensitive. This is because it directly impacts the throttling of all streaming file transfer between datacenters, which can significantly affect the overall performance of data transfer. The code provided includes methods to set and get the value of this configuration, as well as a method to calculate the rate in bytes based on the configured value. These operations are time-expensive and memory-expensive, leading to notable performance variations at the system level."
