    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'enable_materialized_views' is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts system performance by enabling or disabling materialized views, which can have significant implications on performance and storage. The code snippet related to this configuration involves checking if materialized views are enabled and throwing an exception if they are not. Enabling materialized views can lead to time-expensive and memory-expensive operations, causing notable performance variations at the system level."
