    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'full_query_logging_options' configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts system performance by increasing disk space consumption for logging full queries. The configuration involves operations that are memory-expensive, as it stores detailed query logs, and time-expensive, as it may lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The 'enableFullQueryLogger' method allows overriding default options, which can further impact performance depending on the logging settings. Therefore, the configuration's impact on system performance is substantial and should be considered performance-sensitive."
