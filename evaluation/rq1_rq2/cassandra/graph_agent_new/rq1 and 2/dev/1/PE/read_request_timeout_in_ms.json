    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'read_request_timeout_in_ms' configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the system's performance at the system level. The configuration involves setting the timeout value for read operations, which can significantly affect the system's response time and overall latency. The code snippets related to this configuration, such as getMinRpcTimeout, setup, getTimeout, getReadRpcTimeout, and awaitWrites, indicate that the configuration is involved in time-expensive operations that can lead to notable performance variations. Therefore, any changes to this configuration can have a substantial impact on the system's performance."
