    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'flush_compression' configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the system performance by determining the compression algorithm used during flush operations. The choice of compression algorithm can significantly affect the execution time and memory consumption of flush operations, leading to notable performance variations at the system level. The configuration involves performance-related operations that are time-extensive (choosing high ratio compressors like LZ4HC, Zstd, or Deflate) and memory-extensive, which can potentially block flushes for too long. Therefore, the 'flush_compression' configuration is considered performance-sensitive based on its direct and substantial impact on system performance."
