    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'memtable_heap_space_in_mb' configuration is performance-sensitive. This is because it directly impacts the memory usage of memtables in the system, which can lead to significant performance variations at the system level. The code snippet provided shows how this configuration is used to create a MemtablePool based on the allocation type specified in DatabaseDescriptor, indicating that it involves memory-expensive operations. Additionally, the developer's explanation highlights the critical impact of setting the memory limit too low or too high, which can affect the system's performance by causing frequent write stoppages or increased memory usage. Therefore, due to its direct influence on system performance and memory usage, the 'memtable_heap_space_in_mb' configuration is classified as performance-sensitive."
