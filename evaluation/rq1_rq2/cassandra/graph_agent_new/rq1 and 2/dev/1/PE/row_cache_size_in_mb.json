    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'row_cache_size_in_mb' configuration is classified as performance-sensitive because it directly impacts system performance at the system level. The configuration involves setting the maximum size of the row cache in memory, which can lead to notable performance variations based on the amount of memory allocated. The code snippet provided shows how this configuration is used to set the capacity of the cache, indicating that it involves time-expensive and memory-expensive operations that can affect system performance. Additionally, the developer's understanding highlights the significant impact of this configuration on memory usage and potential performance improvements, emphasizing the importance of carefully managing the specified memory size to avoid performance issues."
