    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'tombstone_warn_threshold' configuration is classified as performance-sensitive. This is because adjusting this threshold directly impacts the memory usage and performance of the system by affecting how many tombstones are kept in memory during scans. The configuration involves performance-related operations that are memory-expensive and can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Additionally, the triggering frequency of the configuration depends on how often the method 'getTombstoneWarnThreshold()' is called in the code, indicating its significance in the system's performance."
