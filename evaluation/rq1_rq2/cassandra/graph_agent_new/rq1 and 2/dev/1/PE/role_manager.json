    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'role_manager' configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the system's security and access control mechanisms, which are critical for the overall performance of the system. The configuration involves operations like listing permissions, authenticating users, granting and revoking roles, which are time-expensive and memory-expensive. These operations can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, making the configuration performance-sensitive."
