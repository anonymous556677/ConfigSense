    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'index_summary_capacity_in_mb' configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly affects the memory usage of all index summaries, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The configuration involves setting a fixed memory pool size for SSTable index summaries, which can impact memory consumption significantly. Additionally, the configuration triggers memory-intensive operations during the initialization of the IndexSummaryManager class, which can contribute to time-expensive operations. Therefore, the configuration is considered performance-sensitive as it directly and substantially affects system performance by controlling memory usage and triggering memory-intensive operations."
