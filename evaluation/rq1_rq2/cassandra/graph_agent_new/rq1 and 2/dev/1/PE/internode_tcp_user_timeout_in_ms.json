    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'internode_tcp_user_timeout_in_ms' is performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly affects the time it takes for internode TCP connections to establish, which can have a significant impact on system performance. The code snippet that checks and retrieves the configuration value ('tcpUserTimeoutInMS()') is crucial for determining the timeout period for these connections. Additionally, the developer's explanation highlights the importance of setting this value appropriately to prevent network issues and potential performance degradation. Therefore, the configuration involves time-extensive operations that can lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
