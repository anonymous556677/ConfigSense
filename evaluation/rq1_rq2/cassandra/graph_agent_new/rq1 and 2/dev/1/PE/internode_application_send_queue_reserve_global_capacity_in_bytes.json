    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'internode_application_send_queue_reserve_global_capacity_in_bytes' is performance-sensitive because it directly and substantially affects system performance at the system level. The developer's explanation indicates that exceeding the specified capacity limit can lead to message processing delays, increased memory usage, and potential performance degradation in the cluster. This configuration involves setting limits on queued messages for delivery, which can have a significant impact on system performance by affecting message processing efficiency and memory consumption."
