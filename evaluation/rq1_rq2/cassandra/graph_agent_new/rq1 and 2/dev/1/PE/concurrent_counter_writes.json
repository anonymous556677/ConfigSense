    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'concurrent_counter_writes' configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts system performance by influencing the concurrency and locking mechanism for handling counter mutations. The configuration involves acquiring a number of striped cell-level locks based on the configuration value, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Higher values for this configuration can increase concurrency but may also result in higher memory usage and contention for locks, making it a critical factor in determining system performance."
