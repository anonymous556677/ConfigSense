    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'native_transport_max_frame_size_in_mb' is performance-sensitive. Changing this configuration directly impacts the system performance by affecting the maximum size of frames that can be processed. This can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, as it involves memory-expensive operations related to frame processing. Increasing the value can potentially increase memory usage and processing time, while decreasing the value can improve system performance by rejecting oversized frames. Therefore, this configuration directly and substantially affects system performance, making it performance-sensitive."
