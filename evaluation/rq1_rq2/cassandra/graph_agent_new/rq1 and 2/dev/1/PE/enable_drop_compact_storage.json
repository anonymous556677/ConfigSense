    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'enable_drop_compact_storage' is classified as performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly impacts the availability of the 'DROP COMPACT STORAGE' functionality for tables, which can significantly affect the efficiency of table storage management. The code snippet checking for this configuration is triggered whenever there is an attempt to execute an 'ALTER ... DROP COMPACT STORAGE' statement on a table, indicating that it involves time-expensive operations related to table storage management. Therefore, the configuration can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, making it performance-sensitive."
