    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'server_encryption_options' is classified as performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the configuration directly impacts system performance by setting up server-to-server internode encryption, which involves time-expensive operations such as initializing SSL contexts, creating SSL certificates, and validating SSL certificates. These operations contribute to notable performance variations at the system level due to the overhead of encryption and decryption processes. Therefore, the configuration involves performance-related operations that are time-extensive and memory-expensive, leading to significant performance impacts."
