    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'partitioner' configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts system performance by affecting how data is distributed across nodes. Changing the partitioner configuration requires reloading all data, leading to data migration and redistribution across the cluster, which can have a notable performance impact at the system level. Additionally, the partitioner configuration involves performance-related operations that are time-expensive and memory-expensive within its related code, further contributing to its performance sensitivity."
