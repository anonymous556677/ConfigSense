    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'batch_size_fail_threshold_in_kb' is classified as performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly impacts the system's performance by determining the threshold at which to fail multiple-partition batches exceeding the specified value. The code snippet related to this configuration involves time-expensive operations such as retrieving the threshold using getBatchSizeFailureThreshold() method, which internally calls DatabaseDescriptor.getBatchSizeFailThresholdInKB(). This configuration plays a crucial role in preventing large batches from causing performance issues or failures, thus significantly affecting the system's performance at the system level."
