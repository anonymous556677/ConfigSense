    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'internode_application_send_queue_reserve_endpoint_capacity_in_bytes' is performance-sensitive. This is because the code sets capacity limits for outbound connections based on this configuration, which directly impacts the message queue size and message processing efficiency within the cluster. By controlling the message queue size, this configuration affects the system performance at the system level. Additionally, the configuration involves performance-related operations that are time-extensive, as it sets limits for messages queued for delivery to other nodes, leading to notable performance variations."
