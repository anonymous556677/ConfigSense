    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'cached_rows_warn_threshold' is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts system performance by controlling the number of rows that can be materialized on-heap during index and filtering queries. This can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, as adjusting the thresholds of this configuration can help manage the performance and consistency of the system. The configuration involves performance-related operations that are time-expensive and memory-expensive within its related code, making it a key factor in determining system performance."
