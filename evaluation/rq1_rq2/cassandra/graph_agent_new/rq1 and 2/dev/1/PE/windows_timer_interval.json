    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'windows_timer_interval' is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts system performance by adjusting the system timer on Windows from the default 15ms down to 1ms. This adjustment affects timer intervals, thread scheduling, and driver interrupts, leading to notable performance variations at the system level. The code related to this configuration involves time-extensive operations that significantly impact execution time and memory consumption, making it performance-sensitive."
