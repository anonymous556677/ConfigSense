    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The 'cached_rows_fail_threshold' configuration option is not performance-sensitive. Although it determines the threshold for failing cached replica rows, it does not directly involve any time-extensive or memory-extensive operations within its related code. The impact of this configuration is more related to data accuracy and system behavior rather than causing notable performance variations at the system level. Therefore, it is classified as not performance-sensitive."
