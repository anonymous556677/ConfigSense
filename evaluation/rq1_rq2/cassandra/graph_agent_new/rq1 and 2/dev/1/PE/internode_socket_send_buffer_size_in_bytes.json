    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'internode_socket_send_buffer_size_in_bytes' configuration option is classified as performance-sensitive. This is because setting the socket buffer size for internode communication directly impacts the efficiency and performance of internode communication at the system level. The configuration involves performance-related operations that are time-expensive and memory-expensive within its related code, leading to notable performance variations. The size set for the socket buffer can significantly affect the overall system performance, making it a critical configuration to consider for performance optimization."
