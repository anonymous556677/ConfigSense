    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'stream_throughput_outbound_megabits_per_sec' is performance-sensitive because it directly affects the rate at which streaming file transfers occur between datacenters. The code provided includes methods to set and get the value of this configuration, as well as a method to calculate the rate in bytes based on the configured throughput. Any changes in the throughput value will have a direct impact on the performance of the system by either speeding up or throttling the data transfer rate. This configuration involves performance-related operations that are time-extensive and memory-extensive, leading to notable performance variations at the system level."
