    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'internode_application_send_queue_capacity_in_bytes' is performance-sensitive. This is because the capacity set for message queuing directly impacts the system's performance and resource utilization. The method 'applicationSendQueueCapacityInBytes' retrieves this configuration value, which can significantly affect memory consumption and network bandwidth usage. Depending on the set value, it can lead to congestion and delays in message delivery, or efficient handling of high message volumes. Therefore, the configuration involves performance-related operations that are memory-expensive and time-expensive, leading to notable performance variations at the system level."
