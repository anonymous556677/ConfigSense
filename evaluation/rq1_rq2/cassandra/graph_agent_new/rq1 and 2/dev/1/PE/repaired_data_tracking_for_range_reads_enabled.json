    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'repaired_data_tracking_for_range_reads_enabled' is classified as performance-sensitive. This is because enabling the configuration adds overhead to range read operations by including repaired data tracking for all range reads. This overhead can significantly impact system performance, especially when there are frequent range read operations with multiple full replicas. The performance impact is notable at the system level due to the time-expensive and memory-expensive operations involved in tracking repaired data during reads and comparison between replicas. Therefore, the configuration directly and substantially affects system performance, making it performance-sensitive."
