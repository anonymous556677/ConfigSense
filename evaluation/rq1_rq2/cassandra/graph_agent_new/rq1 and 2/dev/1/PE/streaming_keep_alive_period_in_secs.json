    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'streaming_keep_alive_period_in_secs' is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the system performance by affecting the frequency of keep-alive messages sent between nodes. This configuration involves time-expensive operations as it determines how often keep-alive messages are sent, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Additionally, the code related to this configuration is responsible for scheduling keep-alive tasks for channels, which contributes to the overall execution time and memory consumption of the system."
