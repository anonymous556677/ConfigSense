    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'streaming_connections_per_host' configuration is classified as performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the configuration directly impacts the number of connections per host for streaming, which can significantly affect system performance. Increasing the number of connections per host can potentially improve performance in CPU-bound scenarios, where the system is experiencing bottlenecks during streaming operations. This configuration involves performance-related operations that are time-extensive (such as handling multiple connections) and memory-extensive (such as managing resources for each connection), leading to notable performance variations at the system level."
