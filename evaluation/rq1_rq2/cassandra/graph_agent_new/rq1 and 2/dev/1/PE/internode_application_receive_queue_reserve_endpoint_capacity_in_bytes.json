    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'internode_application_receive_queue_reserve_endpoint_capacity_in_bytes' is classified as performance-sensitive. This is because it directly impacts the memory utilization and message processing efficiency of the system at the system level. By setting a limit on the size of messages that can be queued for delivery to specific endpoints, it helps prevent overwhelming nodes with large amounts of pending messages. This limit ensures that resources are managed effectively and helps maintain a balance between message processing and memory consumption. Additionally, the code retrieves this configuration value and uses it to determine the capacity for queuing messages, indicating that it involves performance-related operations that contribute to execution time and memory consumption."
