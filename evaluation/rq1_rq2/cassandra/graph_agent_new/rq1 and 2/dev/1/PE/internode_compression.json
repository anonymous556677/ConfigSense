    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'internode_compression' configuration is performance-sensitive. This is because enabling compression for traffic between nodes can have a significant impact on system performance at the network level. The compression and decompression operations involved in this configuration are time-expensive and memory-expensive, leading to notable performance variations. Additionally, the triggering frequency of this configuration depends on the frequency of node-to-node communication, indicating that it can be triggered frequently in a system with high communication activity. While the configuration can improve network performance and reduce bandwidth usage, it also introduces additional CPU overhead, further emphasizing its performance sensitivity."
