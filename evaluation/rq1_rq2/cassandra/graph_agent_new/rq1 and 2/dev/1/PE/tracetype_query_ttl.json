    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'tracetype_query_ttl' configuration is considered performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the duration for which trace data is retained, affecting the overall performance and resource usage of the system. The configuration involves setting different TTL values for different trace types, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. This can result in time-expensive and memory-expensive operations within the Tracing class code, contributing to significant performance impacts."
