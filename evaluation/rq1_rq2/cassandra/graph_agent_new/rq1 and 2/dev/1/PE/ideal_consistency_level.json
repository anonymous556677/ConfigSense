    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'ideal_consistency_level' configuration option is classified as performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration involves additional tracking and handling logic for write responses based on the ideal consistency level set. This additional logic can lead to notable performance variations at the system level by adding overhead to write operations. The code context provided by the developer also indicates that the configuration directly impacts system performance by tracking a metric per keyspace for replication consistency, which can be time-expensive and memory-expensive."
