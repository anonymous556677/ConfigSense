    "config_description": "Throttles compaction to the given total throughput across the entire system. The faster you insert data, the faster you need to compact in order to keep the sstable count down, but in general, setting this to 16 to 32 times the rate you are inserting data is more than sufficient. Setting this to 0 disables throttling. Note that this accounts for all types of compaction, including validation compaction (building Merkle trees for repairs).",
    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The configuration 'compaction_throughput_mb_per_sec' is used to throttle compaction to a given total throughput across the entire system. It sets the rate limit for the compaction process based on the value provided.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The configuration is triggered whenever compaction is needed to keep the sstable count down. The frequency of triggering depends on the rate of data insertion and the configured throughput limit.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the 'compaction_throughput_mb_per_sec' configuration option is significant as it directly affects the speed and efficiency of the compaction process. Setting it too low may result in slower compaction and potential bottlenecks, while setting it too high may consume more system resources. It is recommended to set it to a value that is 16 to 32 times the rate of data insertion for optimal performance."
