These limits are applied to the on-wire size of the message being sent or received.  The basic per-link limit is consumed in isolation before any endpoint or global limit is imposed. Each node-pair has three links: urgent, small and large.  So any given node may have a maximum of N*3*(internode_application_send_queue_capacity_in_bytes+internode_application_receive_queue_capacity_in_bytes) messages queued without any coordination between them although in practice, with token-aware routing, only RF*tokens nodes should need to communicate with significant bandwidth.  The per-endpoint limit is imposed on all messages exceeding the per-link limit, simultaneously with the global limit, on all links to or from a single node in the cluster. The global limit is imposed on all messages exceeding the per-link limit, simultaneously with the per-endpoint limit, on all links to or from any node in the cluster. ",

    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The 'internode_application_send_queue_capacity_in_bytes' configuration impacts the system by setting limits on the messages queued for delivery to other nodes and waiting to be processed on arrival from other nodes in the cluster. It helps in managing the on-wire size of the messages being sent or received, and imposes limits on the number of messages that can be queued without coordination between nodes. This configuration helps in optimizing the communication and bandwidth usage within the cluster."
