    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The configuration 'hinted_handoff_enabled' is used to determine whether hinted handoff is enabled globally in the system. The method getHintedHandoffEnabled() returns the value of DatabaseDescriptor.hintedHandoffEnabled(), which ultimately decides if hinted handoff is enabled or not.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The triggering frequency of the 'hinted_handoff_enabled' configuration depends on the execution flow of the shouldHint() method. This method is called whenever hinting is required for a replica. The frequency of triggering would depend on the number of replicas that need hinting and the conditions specified in the shouldHint() method.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the 'hinted_handoff_enabled' configuration option on the system is significant. If hinted handoff is disabled (false), the system will not perform hinting for replicas, which may lead to potential data loss or inconsistency in the system. Enabling hinted handoff (true) ensures that hints are sent to replicas that were unavailable during a write operation, improving data consistency and reliability."
