So a small total commitlog space will tend to cause more flush activity on less-active columnfamilies.  The default value is the smaller of 8192, and 1/4 of the total space of the commitlog volume. ",
    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The configuration 'commitlog_total_space_in_mb' is used to determine the total space to use for commit logs on disk in Cassandra. The code snippet provided calculates the unused capacity by subtracting the current size of active commitlog segment space from the total space specified in the configuration.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The configuration 'commitlog_total_space_in_mb' is triggered whenever the unused capacity falls below a certain threshold, indicating that the commit logs are approaching the specified total space limit. This triggering frequency depends on the rate of write operations and the size of commit log segments.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the 'commitlog_total_space_in_mb' configuration option on the system is significant. If the total space specified is too small, it can lead to frequent flush activity on less-active column families as Cassandra will need to flush every dirty CF in the oldest segment and remove it when the space limit is exceeded. On the other hand, setting a larger total space can reduce the frequency of flush activity but may consume more disk space."
