    "config_description": "Controls when idle client connections are closed. Idle connections are ones that had neither reads nor writes for a time period.  Clients may implement heartbeats by sending OPTIONS native protocol message after a timeout, which will reset idle timeout timer on the server side. To close idle client connections, corresponding values for heartbeat intervals have to be set on the client side.  Idle connection timeouts are disabled by default.",
    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The native_transport_idle_timeout_in_ms configuration controls when idle client connections are closed. If a client connection has neither reads nor writes for a specified time period (idleTimeout), the server will close the connection. This is implemented in the configureInitialPipeline method by adding an IdleStateHandler to the ChannelPipeline with the specified idleTimeout value. When the channel becomes idle, the channelIdle method is triggered, logging a message and closing the connection.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The triggering frequency of the native_transport_idle_timeout_in_ms configuration depends on the idle behavior of client connections. If a client connection remains idle for longer than the specified idleTimeout value, the configuration will be triggered to close the idle connection. The frequency of triggering will vary based on the activity of client connections and their adherence to the idleTimeout value.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the native_transport_idle_timeout_in_ms configuration option on the system is related to the management of idle client connections. By setting a specific idleTimeout value, the system can control the duration of idle connections before they are closed. This can help optimize resource usage by freeing up resources tied to idle connections. However, setting a very short idleTimeout value may result in frequent closure of connections, impacting the overall system performance."
