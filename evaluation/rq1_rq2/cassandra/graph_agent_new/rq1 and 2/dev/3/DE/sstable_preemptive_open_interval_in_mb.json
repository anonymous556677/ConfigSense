This helps to smoothly transfer reads between the sstables, reducing page cache churn and keeping hot rows hot",
    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The configuration 'sstable_preemptive_open_interval_in_mb' is used to calculate the interval for preemptive opening of SSTables. The interval is calculated based on the value of 'sstable_preemptive_open_interval_in_mb' from DatabaseDescriptor multiplied by 1MB (1L << 20). If certain conditions are met, the interval is set to Long.MAX_VALUE.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The triggering frequency of the 'sstable_preemptive_open_interval_in_mb' configuration depends on the compaction process in the system. Whenever compacting occurs and replacement SSTables need to be opened before they are completely written, this configuration is triggered.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the 'sstable_preemptive_open_interval_in_mb' configuration is to improve the efficiency of read transfers between SSTables during compaction. By allowing replacement SSTables to be opened early, it helps reduce page cache churn and keeps hot rows hot, ultimately enhancing the overall performance of the system."
