If disabled, replicas will assume that requests were forwarded to them instantly by the coordinator, which means that under overload conditions we will waste that much extra time processing already-timed-out requests.  Warning: It is generally assumed that users have setup NTP on their clusters, and that clocks are modestly in sync, since this is a requirement for general correctness of last write wins.",

If disabled, replicas will assume that requests were forwarded to them instantly by the coordinator, which may lead to wasting extra time processing already-timed-out requests.",

It is crucial for maintaining system efficiency and preventing performance degradation under overload conditions."
