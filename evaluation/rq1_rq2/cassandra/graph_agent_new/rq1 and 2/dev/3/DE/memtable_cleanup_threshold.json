This value is used in the createMemtableAllocatorPool method to set the cleaningThreshold parameter when creating different types of MemtablePool based on the memtableAllocationType.",

When this ratio exceeds the memtable_cleanup_threshold value, a flush of the largest memtable is triggered.",

A larger memtable_cleanup_threshold value will result in larger flushes and less compaction, but also less concurrent flush activity. This can make it difficult to keep disks fed under heavy write load. The default calculation for memtable_cleanup_threshold is 1 / (memtable_flush_writers + 1), which is considered the most reasonable choice."
