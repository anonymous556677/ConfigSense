    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The configuration 'memtable_heap_space_in_mb' is used to set the total permitted memory to use for memtables in the system.

    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The triggering frequency of the 'memtable_heap_space_in_mb' configuration depends on the usage of memtables in the system. When the total memory used by memtables exceeds the limit set by 'memtable_heap_space_in_mb', Cassandra will stop accepting writes until a flush completes. The frequency of triggering a flush is also influenced by the 'memtable_cleanup_threshold' value.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the 'memtable_heap_space_in_mb' configuration option on the system is significant. If the configured limit is too low, it can lead to frequent flushes and potentially impact the performance of the system. On the other hand, setting a higher limit can increase the memory usage but may improve the overall write performance by reducing the frequency of flushes."
