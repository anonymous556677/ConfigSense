    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'range_request_timeout_in_ms' is performance-sensitive. This is because it directly affects the performance of range and index scans in the system. The timeout value set for this configuration can significantly impact the completion time of these operations, leading to notable performance variations at the system level. The code snippets that fetch and utilize this configuration for timeout values are crucial for determining the execution time of these time-expensive operations, making it a performance-sensitive configuration."
