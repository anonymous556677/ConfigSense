    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The 'enable_materialized_views' configuration option does not directly involve any performance-related operations that are time-extensive or memory-extensive within its related code. The configuration simply checks if materialized views are enabled or not, and throws an exception if they are disabled. This check does not lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Additionally, the impact of this configuration on system performance is related to data modeling and querying capabilities, rather than causing significant performance variations."
