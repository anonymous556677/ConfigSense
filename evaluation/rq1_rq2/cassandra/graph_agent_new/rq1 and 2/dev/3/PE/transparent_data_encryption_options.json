    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'transparent_data_encryption_options' configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts system performance at the system level. Encrypting data at-rest involves time-expensive operations such as encryption and decryption, which can lead to notable performance variations. The configuration-related code indicates that multiple keys can be stored in the keystore, and only the key referenced by the 'key_alias' will be used for encryption operations. This implies that the encryption process involves memory-expensive operations to manage and access keys from the keystore. Additionally, the triggering frequency of the configuration is dependent on write operations that require data encryption, indicating that it can have a significant impact on system performance. Overall, the combination of time-expensive encryption operations and the potential frequency of triggering the configuration make 'transparent_data_encryption_options' performance-sensitive."
