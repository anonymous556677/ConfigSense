    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'incremental_backups' configuration option is classified as performance-sensitive. This is because enabling this configuration results in the creation of hard links for each SSTable flushed or streamed locally, which can significantly impact the storage size of the system. Additionally, the creation of hard links for each SSTable can be a time-expensive operation, especially when dealing with a large number of SSTables. This can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, making the configuration performance-sensitive."
