    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'memtable_heap_space_in_mb' is performance-sensitive. This is because the total permitted memory for memtables directly impacts the system's performance by affecting the frequency of flushes. The code snippet provided shows how this configuration value is used to create a MemtablePool with specified heap and off-heap limits, which are crucial for memory management. If the limit set by 'memtable_heap_space_in_mb' is too low, it can lead to frequent flushes, impacting system performance. Conversely, setting a higher limit can increase memory usage but potentially improve write performance by reducing flush frequency. Therefore, the configuration directly and substantially affects system performance at the system level, making it performance-sensitive."
