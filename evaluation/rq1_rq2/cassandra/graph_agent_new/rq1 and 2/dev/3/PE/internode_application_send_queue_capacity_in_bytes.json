    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'internode_application_send_queue_capacity_in_bytes' is classified as performance-sensitive. This is because it directly impacts the system performance by setting limits on the messages queued for delivery between nodes in the cluster. The configuration involves managing the on-wire size of messages, which can have a significant impact on the system's communication efficiency and bandwidth usage. Additionally, the code context related to this configuration likely includes operations that are time-expensive, such as checking and retrieving values, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
