    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'streaming_connections_per_host' configuration is considered performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that this configuration directly impacts the number of connections per host for streaming operations, which can have a significant effect on system performance. By limiting the number of connections per host, the system can better manage resources and potentially improve performance in scenarios where joins are CPU-bound rather than network-bound. Additionally, the configuration is triggered during critical streaming operations like bootstrap or rebuild processes, indicating its importance in system performance. Therefore, the configuration involves performance-related operations that are time-extensive and memory-extensive, leading to notable performance variations at the system level."
