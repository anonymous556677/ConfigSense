    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'tombstone_failure_threshold' is performance-sensitive. This is because it directly impacts the system performance by determining when a TombstoneOverwhelmingException is thrown, which can significantly affect the system's performance. The code related to this configuration involves checking the number of tombstones encountered during read operations, which can be time-expensive and memory-expensive. Therefore, any changes in the 'tombstone_failure_threshold' value can lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
