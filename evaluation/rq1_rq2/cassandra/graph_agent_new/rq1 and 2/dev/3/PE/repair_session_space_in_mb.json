    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'repair_session_space_in_mb' configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly affects memory usage during repair operations at the system level. The configuration limits the space available for holding RF trees in memory, which can significantly impact the performance of validation compaction. The code snippet that retrieves this configuration and uses it for calculating available space for Merkle tree calculations indicates that it involves memory-expensive operations. Therefore, any changes to this configuration can lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
