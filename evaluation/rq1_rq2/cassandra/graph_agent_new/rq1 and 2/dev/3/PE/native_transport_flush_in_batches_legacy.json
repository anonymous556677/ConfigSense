    "Reason": "The configuration 'native_transport_flush_in_batches_legacy' is not considered performance-sensitive based on the provided information. Although it involves batching multiple messages into a single TCP packet to improve throughput, the impact of enabling this configuration is dependent on the system's environment and may not lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The developer's explanation also indicates that the configuration may have varying impacts based on the system's kernel version and the number of client connections, suggesting that it may not directly and substantially affect system performance in all scenarios."
