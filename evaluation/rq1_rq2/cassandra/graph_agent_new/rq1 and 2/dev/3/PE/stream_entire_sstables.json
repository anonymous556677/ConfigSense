    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'stream_entire_sstables' configuration is considered performance-sensitive. This is because enabling this configuration directly impacts system performance by allowing Cassandra to zero-copy stream entire eligible SSTables between nodes, which can significantly speed up network transfer and reduce GC pressure. The code snippet in the method 'computeShouldStreamEntireSSTables' involves time-expensive operations such as checking if full sstable transfers are enabled in the DatabaseDescriptor and if there are no legacy counter shards present in the SSTable metadata. These operations can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, making the configuration performance-sensitive."
