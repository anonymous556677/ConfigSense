    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The 'key_cache_save_period' configuration option is not performance-sensitive. The developer's explanation indicates that this configuration determines how frequently the key cache is saved, which can improve cold-start speeds but is relatively cheap in terms of I/O for the key cache. The configuration does not involve any time-extensive or memory-extensive operations that would lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Therefore, it does not directly and substantially affect system performance in a significant way."
