    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'commit_failure_policy' configuration is classified as performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly impacts system performance by determining how the system handles commit disk failures, leading to actions such as node shutdowns, JVM termination, commit log shutdowns, and batch failures. These actions can have a significant impact on system availability and reliability. Additionally, the configuration involves performance-related operations that are time-expensive and memory-expensive within its related code, causing notable performance variations at the system level."
