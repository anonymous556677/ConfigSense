    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'internode_application_send_queue_reserve_endpoint_capacity_in_bytes' is performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly impacts the system performance by setting limits on the size of messages queued for delivery to other nodes and waiting to be processed on arrival from other nodes. This limit on message queue size can have a significant impact on system performance, especially in scenarios where the message queue size exceeds the specified capacity. Additionally, the configuration-related code involves setting values based on DatabaseDescriptor and MessagingService, which are time-expensive operations. Therefore, the configuration is considered performance-sensitive due to its direct and substantial effect on system performance at the system level."
