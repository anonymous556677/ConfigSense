    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'column_index_cache_size_in_kb' configuration option is performance-sensitive. This is because it directly impacts the memory usage and performance of the system by determining the size limit for sstable indexed key cache entries. Entries exceeding this size will not be held on heap, leading to increased disk reads for index entries. This configuration involves memory-expensive operations that can have a notable performance variation at the system level, making it performance-sensitive."
