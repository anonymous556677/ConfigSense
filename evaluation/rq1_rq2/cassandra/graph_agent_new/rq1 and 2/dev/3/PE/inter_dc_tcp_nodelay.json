    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'inter_dc_tcp_nodelay' configuration is classified as performance-sensitive. This is because enabling or disabling tcp_nodelay for inter-dc communication directly impacts system performance at the system level. The code snippet related to this configuration involves checking the tcpNoDelay flag, determining if the communication is within the local data center, and retrieving values from the DatabaseDescriptor. These operations can be time-expensive and memory-expensive, leading to notable performance variations in the system. Additionally, the triggering frequency of this configuration depends on the frequency of inter-dc communication requests, indicating its importance in system performance."
