    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'internode_application_send_queue_reserve_global_capacity_in_bytes' is performance-sensitive. This is because it directly impacts the system's performance by setting limits on the amount of queued messages allowed, which can significantly affect memory consumption and network resources. The configuration involves performance-related operations that are time-expensive and memory-expensive within its related code, leading to notable performance variations at the system level."
