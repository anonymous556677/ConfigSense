    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'internode_socket_send_buffer_size_in_bytes' is performance-sensitive. The code related to this configuration involves checking and setting the socket buffer size for internode communication, which can have a direct impact on the performance of internode communication in the system. This configuration directly affects system performance at the system level by potentially causing notable performance variations, especially in scenarios where the buffer size is set to a value that significantly impacts the time and memory consumption of internode communication operations."
