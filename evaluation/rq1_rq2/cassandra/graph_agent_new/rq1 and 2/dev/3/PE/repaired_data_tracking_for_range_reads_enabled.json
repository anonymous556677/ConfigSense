    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'repaired_data_tracking_for_range_reads_enabled' is classified as performance-sensitive. Enabling this configuration adds overhead to range read operations by tracking repaired data, which can impact system performance, especially when there are frequent range read operations with multiple full replicas. This configuration directly affects system performance at the system level by introducing time-expensive and memory-expensive operations within its related code, leading to notable performance variations."
