    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'tombstone_warn_threshold' configuration is performance-sensitive. This is because adjusting this threshold directly impacts the amount of tombstones kept in memory during scans, which can significantly affect system performance and memory usage. The code context related to this configuration involves time-expensive operations that can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Therefore, the configuration is considered performance-sensitive based on its impact on system performance and memory consumption."
