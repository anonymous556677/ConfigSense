    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'memtable_offheap_space_in_mb' configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly and substantially affects system performance at the system level. The configuration is triggered whenever the total memory used for memtables exceeds the limit set by 'memtable_offheap_space_in_mb', leading to notable performance variations such as Cassandra stopping accepting writes until a flush completes. Additionally, the configuration involves setting the total permitted memory for memtables, which directly impacts memory usage and can result in frequent flushes and decreased performance if set too low, or excessive memory usage if set too high. Therefore, the configuration is considered performance-sensitive due to its significant impact on system performance and memory usage."
