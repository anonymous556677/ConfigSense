    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'native_transport_max_frame_size_in_mb' is performance-sensitive. Increasing the maximum frame size directly impacts the memory usage and processing time of the system. Larger frames require more memory and processing resources, leading to notable performance variations at the system level. The configuration involves performance-related operations that are memory-expensive within its related code, making it a performance-sensitive configuration."
