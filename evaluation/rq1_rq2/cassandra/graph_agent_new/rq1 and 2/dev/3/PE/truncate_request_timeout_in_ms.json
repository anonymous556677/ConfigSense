    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The 'truncate_request_timeout_in_ms' configuration option is not performance-sensitive. This is because setting the timeout for truncating operations does not directly and substantially affect system performance at the system level. While the configuration may impact the time allowed for truncates to complete, it does not involve any time-extensive or memory-extensive operations within its related code that lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
