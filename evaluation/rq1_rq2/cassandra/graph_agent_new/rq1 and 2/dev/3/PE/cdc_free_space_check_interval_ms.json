    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'cdc_free_space_check_interval_ms' is not performance-sensitive based on the provided information. The developer's explanation indicates that this configuration is used to periodically check for available space for cdc-tracked tables when the cdc_raw limit is hit. While this operation may have some impact on system performance, it is not directly and substantially affecting system performance at the system level. The frequency of triggering at 250ms is relatively low and the size impact is focused on managing space for cdc-tracked tables, rather than causing notable performance variations. Therefore, the configuration is not classified as performance-sensitive."
