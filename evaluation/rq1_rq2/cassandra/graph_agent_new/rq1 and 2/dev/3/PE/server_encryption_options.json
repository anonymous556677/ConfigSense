    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'server_encryption_options' is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts system performance by setting up server-to-server internode encryption through SSL socket protocols and cipher suites. This involves time-expensive operations such as configuring custom encryption options to replace JVM and netty defaults, setting up server keystores and truststores for mutual authentication, and periodic checks for SSL certificate updates. These operations can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, making the configuration performance-sensitive."
