    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'stream_throughput_outbound_megabits_per_sec' is performance-sensitive. This is because it directly impacts the rate at which streaming file transfers occur between datacenters, leading to notable performance variations at the system level. The triggering frequency of this configuration indicates that it involves time-expensive operations such as setting new values for stream throughput and calculating rates in bytes. These operations contribute significantly to execution time and memory consumption, making the configuration performance-sensitive."
