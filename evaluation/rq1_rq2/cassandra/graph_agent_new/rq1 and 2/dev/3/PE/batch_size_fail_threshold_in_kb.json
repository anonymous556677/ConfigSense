    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'batch_size_fail_threshold_in_kb' is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the threshold value directly impacts the reliability and performance of the system at the system level. The code snippet related to this configuration involves checking the size of multiple-partition batches and determining if they exceed the specified threshold, which can lead to batch failures. This operation is time-expensive and memory-expensive as it involves additional checks and comparisons, contributing to notable performance variations in the system. Therefore, any changes to this configuration can have a significant impact on the system's overall throughput and reliability."
