{
    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'index_summary_capacity_in_mb' is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the configuration directly impacts the memory usage of the system at the system level by setting a fixed memory pool size for SSTable index summaries. This can lead to notable performance variations as it affects the memory consumption of the system. Additionally, the code snippet initializing the IndexSummaryManager based on this configuration involves memory-expensive operations, further emphasizing its performance sensitivity."
