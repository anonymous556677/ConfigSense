    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'ideal_consistency_level' configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts system performance by tracking whether replication achieved the ideal consistency level for writes without timing out. This involves time-extensive operations such as checking and updating the ideal consistency level, which can have a notable performance variation at the system level. Additionally, the configuration is triggered frequently when certain methods are called, indicating its importance in system performance. Therefore, the 'ideal_consistency_level' configuration is considered performance-sensitive based on its code context and impact on system performance."
