    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'internode_tcp_connect_timeout_in_ms' is performance-sensitive because it directly affects the time it takes for internode tcp connections to establish in Cassandra, which is a critical operation for communication between nodes in the cluster. The code related to this configuration involves time-expensive operations such as setting and retrieving the timeout value, which can have a notable impact on system performance. Additionally, the proper setting of this configuration is crucial for preventing network-related issues and ensuring smooth communication, highlighting its importance in system performance."
