    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'internode_application_receive_queue_capacity_in_bytes' is classified as performance-sensitive. This is because the size limit set by this configuration directly impacts the memory consumption of the system, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The code snippet related to this configuration ensures that the specified value is used for the application receive queue capacity, indicating that it plays a crucial role in managing incoming messages from other nodes in the cluster. Since the triggering frequency of this configuration depends on the volume of internode communication, any inefficiencies in memory allocation can result in performance degradation or dropped messages. Therefore, optimizing this configuration is essential for system performance."
