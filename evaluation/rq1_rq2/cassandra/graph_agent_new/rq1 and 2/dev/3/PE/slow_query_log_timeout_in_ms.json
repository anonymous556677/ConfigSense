    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'slow_query_log_timeout_in_ms' configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts system performance by affecting the logging behavior for slow queries. The configuration involves time-extensive operations related to logging slow queries, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Setting a higher value for this configuration can result in increased logging activity, potentially impacting system performance due to the additional overhead of logging operations."
