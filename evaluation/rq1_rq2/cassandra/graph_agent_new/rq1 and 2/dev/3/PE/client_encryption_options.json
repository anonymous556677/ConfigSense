{
    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'client_encryption_options' is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the configuration directly impacts system performance by handling client-to-server encryption, which involves time-expensive operations such as initializing SSL certificates, creating SSL contexts, and setting up SSL handlers. These operations can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, as they add computational overhead for SSL/TLS encryption and decryption processes. Additionally, the configuration's impact on resource consumption, such as memory and CPU usage, further confirms its performance sensitivity."
