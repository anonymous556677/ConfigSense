    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'enable_user_defined_functions' is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts system performance by enabling user-defined functions in the cassandra.yaml file. Enabling user-defined functions can introduce security risks and potentially lead to time-expensive and memory-expensive operations within the system. If not properly managed, this configuration can cause notable performance variations at the system level, making it performance-sensitive."
