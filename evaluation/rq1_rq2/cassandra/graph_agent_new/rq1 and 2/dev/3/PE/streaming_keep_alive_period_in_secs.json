    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'streaming_keep_alive_period_in_secs' is performance-sensitive. This is because the frequency of keep-alive messages being sent directly impacts the system performance at the network level. A shorter period increases network traffic and helps in detecting stalled streams more quickly, while a longer period reduces network overhead but increases the time to detect stalled streams. This configuration directly affects the execution time and memory consumption of the system, making it performance-sensitive."
