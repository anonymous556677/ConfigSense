    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'cdc_total_space_in_mb' is performance-sensitive. This is because it directly impacts the performance of the system at the system level. The configuration involves time-extensive operations such as determining the total space available for change-data-capture logs on disk, which can lead to notable performance variations. Additionally, exceeding the threshold set by this configuration can result in WriteTimeoutException on Mutations, affecting the write operations on tables with CDC enabled, and impacting the performance of the CDCCompactor responsible for parsing and deleting raw CDC logs."
