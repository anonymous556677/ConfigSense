    "Reason": "The 'counter_cache_keys_to_save' configuration does not directly and substantially affect system performance at the system level. The configuration is mainly focused on controlling the amount of data being saved from the counter cache, which may impact storage space but does not lead to notable performance variations. The configuration does not involve any time-extensive or memory-extensive operations within its related code that would significantly impact system performance."
