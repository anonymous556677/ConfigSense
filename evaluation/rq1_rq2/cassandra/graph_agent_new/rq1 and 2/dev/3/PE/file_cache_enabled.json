    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'file_cache_enabled' configuration option is performance-sensitive. This is because enabling this configuration directly impacts system performance by storing recently accessed sections of the sstable in-memory as uncompressed buffers, which can improve read performance by reducing disk I/O operations for frequently accessed data. Additionally, the configuration-related code checks if the file cache is enabled and if the cache size is greater than 0 to create an instance of ChunkCache, which involves time-expensive operations. Therefore, the configuration involves performance-related operations that are time-extensive and memory-expensive, leading to notable performance variations at the system level."
