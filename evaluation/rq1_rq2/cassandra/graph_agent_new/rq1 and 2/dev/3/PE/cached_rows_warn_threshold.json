    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'cached_rows_warn_threshold' is performance-sensitive. This is because it directly impacts the system performance by limiting the number of rows from replicas that can materialize on-heap for query results, affecting the read consistency level. The configuration involves performance-related operations that can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, such as triggering warnings or query failures based on the set threshold values. Adjusting these thresholds can significantly impact the performance and consistency of the system, making it a performance-sensitive configuration."
