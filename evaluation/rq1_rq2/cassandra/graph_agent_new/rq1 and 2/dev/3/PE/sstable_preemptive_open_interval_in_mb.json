    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'sstable_preemptive_open_interval_in_mb' is performance-sensitive. This is because it directly impacts the efficiency of read transfers between SSTables during compaction, which is a time-expensive operation. The calculation of the interval based on this configuration involves multiplication by 1MB, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Additionally, the triggering frequency of this configuration is tied to the compaction process, indicating its importance in system performance."
