    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'corrupted_tombstone_strategy' configuration is performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly impacts the system performance by determining how tombstones are validated on reads and compactions. Depending on the value of the configuration, different actions are taken when invalid deletions are encountered, leading to notable performance variations at the system level. The configuration involves performance-related operations that are time-expensive and memory-expensive within its related code, such as throwing exceptions, logging warning messages, or taking no action, which can significantly affect system performance."
