    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The 'role_manager' configuration is not performance-sensitive based on the provided information. Although it plays a crucial role in authentication and authorization operations, the performance impact of this configuration is not directly related to time-expensive or memory-expensive operations within its code. The primary focus of the 'role_manager' configuration is on security and access control rather than on system performance optimization. Therefore, it does not lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
