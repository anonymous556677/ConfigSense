    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'flush_compression' configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the system's performance at the system level. The selection of compression algorithm during flushes can significantly affect the throughput of the system, especially for large tables. This configuration involves performance-related operations that are time-expensive and memory-expensive, leading to notable performance variations. The code context provided by the developer also indicates that the configuration is triggered during 'FLUSH' operations, which further emphasizes its performance sensitivity."
