    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'allocate_tokens_for_local_replication_factor' is performance-sensitive. This is because the code snippet associated with this configuration involves operations that determine the token allocation algorithm for generating suitable tokens for new nodes joining the cluster. This allocation process can have a significant impact on the distribution of data across the cluster, affecting system performance and load balancing. Additionally, the configuration is triggered when generating bootstrap tokens for new nodes, indicating its importance in system performance. Therefore, the configuration directly and substantially affects system performance at the system level, making it performance-sensitive."
