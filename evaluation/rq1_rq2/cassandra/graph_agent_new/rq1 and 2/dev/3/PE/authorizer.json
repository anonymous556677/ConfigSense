    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'authorizer' configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts system performance at the system level by controlling access control and permissions within the Cassandra system. The configuration involves classes for user authentication, role management, and permission granting, which are time-expensive operations. Additionally, the configuration interacts with the system_auth keyspace to store role permissions, which can lead to notable performance variations. Therefore, the 'authorizer' configuration is considered performance-sensitive based on its significant impact on system performance and the presence of time-expensive operations within its related code."
