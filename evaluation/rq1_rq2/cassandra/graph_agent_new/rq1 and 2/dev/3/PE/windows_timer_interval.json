    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'windows_timer_interval' is performance-sensitive. This is because adjusting the system timer on Windows from the default 15ms down to 1ms can have a significant impact on timer intervals, thread scheduling, driver interrupts, and overall system performance. The configuration directly affects system performance at the system level by potentially reducing latency and improving throughput. Additionally, the configuration involves time-extensive operations related to starting and ending timer periods in the code, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
