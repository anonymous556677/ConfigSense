    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'internode_streaming_tcp_user_timeout_in_ms' is performance-sensitive because it directly affects the processing time of incoming stream messages. The code checks this configuration value to determine if the processing time exceeds the specified timeout value, which can lead to the closing of the streaming connection. This configuration involves time-extensive operations within its related code that can have a notable performance impact at the system level."
