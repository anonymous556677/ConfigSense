    "classification_result": "Performance-insensitive with 100% confidence",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'Number of simultaneous compactions to allow' is performance-insensitive because it primarily affects the compaction process, which is not directly related to system performance in terms of speed or efficiency. It is more about managing the workload and resources efficiently during compaction processes."
