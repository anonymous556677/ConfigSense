    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'dynamic_snitch_update_interval_in_ms' is performance-sensitive. This is because it directly affects the frequency of the expensive host score calculation in the code, leading to notable performance variations at the system level. The developer's explanation also confirms that the configuration is triggered whenever the applyConfigChanges() method is called, indicating its impact on system performance. Additionally, the size impact analysis highlights the significant impact of this configuration on system load and the trade-off between up-to-date information and potentially outdated scores, further emphasizing its performance sensitivity."
