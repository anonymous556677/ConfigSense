    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'concurrent_materialized_view_builders' is performance-sensitive because it directly affects the number of simultaneous materialized view builder tasks allowed in the system. This configuration can lead to notable performance variations at the system level by impacting the execution time and memory consumption of materialized view building processes. The calls to getConcurrentViewBuilders() and setConcurrentViewBuilders() methods in the CompactionManager class trigger this configuration, indicating its importance in controlling system performance. Setting this configuration too low or too high can result in significant performance issues, highlighting its sensitivity to system performance."
