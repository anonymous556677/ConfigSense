    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'read_request_timeout_in_ms' configuration is considered performance-sensitive because it directly affects the performance and responsiveness of read operations in the system. The configuration is triggered for every read operation, and setting a lower or higher timeout value can lead to significant performance variations at the system level. This configuration involves time-sensitive operations that can have a notable impact on the overall system performance."
