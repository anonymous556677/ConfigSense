    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'internode_application_receive_queue_reserve_endpoint_capacity_in_bytes' is classified as performance-sensitive. This is because the setting directly impacts the memory allocation for queuing messages per endpoint, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The configuration involves memory-expensive operations that can significantly affect the system's performance, especially in scenarios with high communication activity between nodes. Adjusting this configuration can have a substantial impact on the system's memory footprint and message queuing efficiency, making it a critical factor in system performance."
