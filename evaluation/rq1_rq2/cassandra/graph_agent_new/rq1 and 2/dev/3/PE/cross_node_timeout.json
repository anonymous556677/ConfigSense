    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'cross_node_timeout' configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts system performance by enabling accurate request timeout measurements. This configuration involves time-expensive operations related to cross-node communication and timeout measurement, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Disabling this configuration may result in wasted processing time on timed-out requests, causing performance degradation under overload conditions. Therefore, the 'cross_node_timeout' configuration is considered performance-sensitive based on its significant impact on system performance."
