    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The initial_token configuration is classified as performance-sensitive because it directly impacts system performance at the system level. The code related to this configuration involves time-expensive operations such as token generation and assignment, which can lead to notable performance variations. Additionally, the configuration's impact on system performance is significant when adding new nodes or manually specifying tokens, making it crucial for system scalability and flexibility."
