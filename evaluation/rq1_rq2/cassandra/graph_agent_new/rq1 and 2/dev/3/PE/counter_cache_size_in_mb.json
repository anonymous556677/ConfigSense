    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'counter_cache_size_in_mb' configuration is considered performance-sensitive because it directly impacts system performance by determining the maximum size of the counter cache in memory. The size of the cache can significantly affect performance, especially in scenarios with RF = 1. The code initializes the counter cache with the specified capacity in megabytes, and the cache is scheduled to save keys periodically based on the configured save period. This configuration involves performance-related operations that are memory-expensive and can lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
