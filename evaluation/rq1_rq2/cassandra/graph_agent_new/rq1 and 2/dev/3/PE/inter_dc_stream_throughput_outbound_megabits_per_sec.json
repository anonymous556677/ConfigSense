    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'inter_dc_stream_throughput_outbound_megabits_per_sec' is performance-sensitive. This is because it directly controls the rate at which streaming file transfer occurs between datacenters, impacting network bandwidth usage and potentially causing congestion. The code provided includes methods to set and get the value of this configuration, as well as a method to calculate the inter DC rate in bytes based on the configured throughput. These operations are time-expensive and memory-expensive, leading to notable performance variations at the system level."
