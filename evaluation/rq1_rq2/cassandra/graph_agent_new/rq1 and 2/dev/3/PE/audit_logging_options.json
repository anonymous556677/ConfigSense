    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The audit_logging_options configuration is classified as performance-sensitive. Enabling audit logging through this configuration can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The logging of every incoming CQL command request and authentication events can be time-expensive and memory-expensive operations, impacting system resources such as disk space and processing power. The configuration directly and substantially affects system performance by generating a significant amount of log data, which can have a significant impact on system resources and overall performance."
