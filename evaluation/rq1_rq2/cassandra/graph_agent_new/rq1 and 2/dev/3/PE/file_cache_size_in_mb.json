    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'file_cache_size_in_mb' configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly affects the memory usage for sstable chunk cache and buffer pooling, which are time-expensive and memory-expensive operations. By adjusting this configuration, developers can control the amount of memory allocated for caching data, leading to notable performance variations at the system level. The configuration involves performance-related operations that have a substantial impact on system performance, making it performance-sensitive."
