    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'native_transport_max_threads' configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the system's performance at the system level. The configuration is used to determine the maximum number of threads for handling transport requests, which are time-expensive operations. Setting this value too low can lead to performance degradation due to requests being queued up, while setting it too high can consume excessive system resources. Therefore, the configuration directly affects system performance by influencing the handling of transport requests, making it performance-sensitive."
