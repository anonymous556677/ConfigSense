    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'row_cache_size_in_mb' configuration is considered performance-sensitive because it directly affects the amount of memory allocated for the row cache, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The code snippet provided shows that the value of 'row_cache_size_in_mb' is used to set the capacity of the cache in bytes, indicating that it involves memory-expensive operations. Setting a higher value for this configuration can result in increased memory usage by the cache, potentially impacting the overall system performance. Therefore, the configuration is performance-sensitive as it directly and substantially affects system performance by influencing memory consumption."
