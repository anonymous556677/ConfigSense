    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The 'dynamic_snitch_reset_interval_in_ms' configuration is not performance-sensitive. The configuration controls the frequency at which host scores are reset, which may impact system stability and reliability but does not directly lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The code snippet provided shows that the configuration is used for scheduling tasks and does not involve any time-extensive or memory-extensive operations that would significantly affect system performance."
