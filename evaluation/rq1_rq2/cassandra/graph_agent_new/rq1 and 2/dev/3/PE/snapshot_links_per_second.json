    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'snapshot_links_per_second' is performance-sensitive. From the system level perspective, setting a non-zero value for this configuration can directly and substantially affect system performance by throttling the creation or removal of snapshot links, thus preventing negative performance impact on consumer grade SSDs. This configuration involves performance-related operations that are time-extensive, as it manages the frequency of triggering based on the number of snapshot links being created or removed. Therefore, it leads to notable performance variations at the system level."
