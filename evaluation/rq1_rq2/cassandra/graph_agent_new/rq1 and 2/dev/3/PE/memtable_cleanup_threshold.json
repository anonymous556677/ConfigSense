    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The memtable_cleanup_threshold configuration is performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly impacts the system performance by determining the ratio of occupied non-flushing memtable size to total permitted size that triggers a flush of the largest memtable. This operation is time-expensive and memory-expensive as it involves managing memory allocation and flushing operations, which can significantly affect the overall system performance. Additionally, the developer's explanation highlights the significant impact of the configuration on system behavior, indicating that it is a critical factor in managing system resources and performance under heavy write loads."
