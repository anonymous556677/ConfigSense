    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'num_tokens' configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly affects the distribution of data across nodes in the system, leading to potential performance issues. By setting different numbers of tokens for nodes, it can cause uneven data distribution and imbalanced load, impacting system performance at the system level. Additionally, the configuration involves performance-related operations related to data distribution and load balancing, which can have a notable performance impact on the system."
