    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The native_transport_idle_timeout_in_ms configuration is classified as performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly impacts system performance by controlling the duration of idle client connections before they are closed. The code implementation of this configuration involves adding an IdleStateHandler to the ChannelPipeline with the specified idleTimeout value, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Depending on the idleTimeout value set, the frequency of triggering the configuration to close idle connections can significantly affect system performance by managing resource usage efficiently. Therefore, the time-extensive and memory-extensive operations related to this configuration make it performance-sensitive."
