    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'network_authorizer' configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts system performance by managing permissions related to network access. The use of a more restrictive network authorizer like CassandraNetworkAuthorizer can lead to notable performance variations at the system level due to the additional resources and complexity required in managing permissions. The configuration involves performance-related operations that are time-expensive and memory-expensive, making it a significant factor in system performance."
