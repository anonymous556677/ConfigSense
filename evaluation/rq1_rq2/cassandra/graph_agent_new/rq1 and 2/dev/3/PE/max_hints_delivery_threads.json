    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The max_hints_delivery_threads configuration is considered performance-sensitive. This is because it directly affects the number of threads used for hint delivery, which can have a notable impact on system performance. Increasing the value of max_hints_delivery_threads can potentially improve the speed of hint delivery, especially in multi-dc deployments. However, this can also lead to increased consumption of system resources such as CPU and memory, depending on the workload and system capacity. The configuration involves performance-related operations that are time-expensive (thread management) and memory-expensive (resource consumption), leading to notable performance variations at the system level."
