    "Reason": "The 'auto_snapshot' configuration option does not directly involve any performance-related operations that are time-extensive or memory-extensive within its related code. While it has a significant impact on data safety, it does not lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The triggering frequency of this configuration also depends on user actions or system maintenance, rather than being a continuous performance-sensitive operation."
