    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'allocate_tokens_for_keyspace' is performance-sensitive. This is because it directly impacts the token allocation strategy for new nodes joining the cluster, which in turn affects the distribution of data across nodes and can significantly impact system performance and load balancing. The code related to this configuration involves operations that are time-expensive, such as generating tokens based on specified initial tokens or allocationKeyspace, or choosing random tokens if neither is specified. These operations can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, making this configuration performance-sensitive."
