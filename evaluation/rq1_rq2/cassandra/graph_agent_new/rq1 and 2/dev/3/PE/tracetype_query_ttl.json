    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'tracetype_query_ttl' configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the system performance at the system level. The configuration involves setting the TTL for trace types during the repair process, which can lead to notable performance variations based on the storage size and performance impact. Depending on the TTL value set, there can be significant differences in storage usage and data expiration, affecting the overall system performance during repair processes. Additionally, the retrieval of TTL values based on the ordinal value of the TraceType enum can also contribute to time-expensive operations, further emphasizing the performance sensitivity of this configuration."
