    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'enable_sasi_indexes' configuration is classified as performance-sensitive. This is because enabling SASI indexes through this configuration can have a notable impact on system performance. The creation of SASI indexes on tables is a time-expensive operation that can lead to significant performance variations at the system level. Additionally, the developer's information indicates that SASI indexes are experimental and not recommended for production use, which further emphasizes the potential performance issues that may arise from enabling this configuration."
