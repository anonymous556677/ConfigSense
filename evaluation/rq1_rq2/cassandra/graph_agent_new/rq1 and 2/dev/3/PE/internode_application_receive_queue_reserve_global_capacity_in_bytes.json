    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'internode_application_receive_queue_reserve_global_capacity_in_bytes' is classified as performance-sensitive. This is because it directly and substantially affects system performance at the system level by setting the global limit on the size of messages queued for delivery between nodes in the cluster. The configuration involves performance-related operations that are memory-extensive, as it determines the maximum amount of memory that can be consumed by queued messages. Setting this value incorrectly can lead to message loss, delays in message delivery, increased memory usage, and potential performance issues, all of which can cause notable performance variations at the system level."
