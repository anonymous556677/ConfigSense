    "Reason": "The 'full_query_logging_options' configuration is considered performance-sensitive. The code includes methods for enabling and resetting the full query logger, which can have time-expensive and memory-expensive operations related to logging full queries. Enabling the full query logger with certain parameters can increase disk space usage and potentially impact system performance. This configuration directly affects system performance at the system level by introducing notable performance variations through its logging operations."
