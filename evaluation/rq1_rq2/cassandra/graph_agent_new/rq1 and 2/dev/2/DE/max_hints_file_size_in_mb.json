    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The configuration 'max_hints_file_size_in_mb' is used to set the maximum size for a single hints file in megabytes. In the provided code snippet, the value of 'maxHintsFileSize' is obtained from 'DatabaseDescriptor.getMaxHintsFileSize()' and is used to determine when to break the writing process in the 'flushInternal' method if the session position exceeds the specified maximum hints file size.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The triggering frequency of the 'max_hints_file_size_in_mb' configuration depends on the size of the hints files being written. Whenever a new hints file is being written, the system checks the size of the file against the specified maximum size to determine if the writing process should continue or break.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the 'max_hints_file_size_in_mb' configuration option on the system is that it helps in controlling the size of individual hints files. By setting a maximum size limit, it ensures that hints files do not grow too large, which can help in managing disk space usage and optimizing performance."
