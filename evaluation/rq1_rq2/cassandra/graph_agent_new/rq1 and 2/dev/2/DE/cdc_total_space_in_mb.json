If space gets above this value, Cassandra will throw WriteTimeoutException on Mutations including tables with CDC enabled. A CDCCompactor is responsible for parsing the raw CDC logs and deleting them when parsing is completed.  The default value is the min of 4096 mb and 1/8th of the total space of the drive where cdc_raw_directory resides.",
    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The configuration code 'cdc_total_space_in_mb' is used to determine the total space available for change-data-capture logs on disk. It calculates the allowable space by multiplying the value of 'CDCSpaceInMB' obtained from DatabaseDescriptor by 1024*1024.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The triggering frequency of the 'cdc_total_space_in_mb' configuration depends on the amount of change-data-capture logs being generated and stored on disk. It is triggered whenever new data is written to tables with CDC enabled, and the space usage approaches or exceeds the configured total space limit.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the 'cdc_total_space_in_mb' configuration option on the system is significant. If the space allocated for CDC logs exceeds the configured limit, Cassandra will throw WriteTimeoutException on Mutations for tables with CDC enabled. This can lead to data loss and system instability. It is crucial to monitor and manage the CDC log space to prevent such issues."
