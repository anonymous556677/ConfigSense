This means that only partition information is held on heap and the index entries are read from disk.  Note that this size refers to the size of the serialized index information and not the size of the partition.",
    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The configuration 'column_index_cache_size_in_kb' is used to determine the size limit for sstable indexed key cache entries. If the size of the entries exceeds this limit, they will not be held in heap memory and will be read from disk instead. Only partition information will be held in heap memory.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The triggering frequency of the 'column_index_cache_size_in_kb' configuration depends on the size of the sstable indexed key cache entries. Whenever new entries are added or existing entries are accessed, the configuration may be triggered.",

If the size limit is set too low, it may result in frequent disk reads and slower performance. On the other hand, setting it too high may consume more memory than necessary."
