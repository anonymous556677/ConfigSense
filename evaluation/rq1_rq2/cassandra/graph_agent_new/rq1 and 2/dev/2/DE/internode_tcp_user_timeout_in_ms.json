The amount of time to wait for internode tcp connections to establish. internode_tcp_connect_timeout_in_ms: 2000  The amount of time unacknowledged data is allowed on a connection before we throw out the connection Note this is only supported on Linux + epoll, and it appears to behave oddly above a setting of 30000 (it takes much longer than 30s) as of Linux 4.12. If you want something that high set this to 0 which picks up the OS default and configure the net.ipv4.tcp_retries2 sysctl to be ~8.",
    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The configuration 'internode_tcp_user_timeout_in_ms' is used in the code to set the amount of time to wait for internode TCP connections to establish. The method tcpUserTimeoutInMS() checks if the configuration value is set, and if not, it returns the value based on the connection category (messaging or streaming) from DatabaseDescriptor.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The triggering frequency of the 'internode_tcp_user_timeout_in_ms' configuration depends on the creation of internode TCP connections for messaging or streaming. The configuration is triggered whenever a new connection is established in the system.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the 'internode_tcp_user_timeout_in_ms' configuration option is significant for protecting Cassandra from true network partitions. Setting this configuration to an appropriate value ensures that internode TCP connections are established within the specified time limit, preventing potential network issues and improving system reliability."
