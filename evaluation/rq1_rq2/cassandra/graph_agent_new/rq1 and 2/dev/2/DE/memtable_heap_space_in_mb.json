    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The configuration 'memtable_heap_space_in_mb' is used to set the total permitted memory to use for memtables in Cassandra. The code snippet provided shows how the configuration value is retrieved using DatabaseDescriptor.getMemtableHeapSpaceInMb() and then used to set the heapLimit for the MemtablePool.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The triggering frequency of the configuration 'memtable_heap_space_in_mb' in the system depends on the memtable_cleanup_threshold value set in the configuration. When the total memory used for memtables exceeds the heapLimit set by 'memtable_heap_space_in_mb', Cassandra will stop accepting writes until a flush completes. The frequency of triggering a flush is based on the memtable_cleanup_threshold value.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the 'memtable_heap_space_in_mb' configuration option on the system is significant. If the configured memory limit is too low, it can lead to frequent flushes and potentially impact the performance of the system. On the other hand, if the memory limit is set too high, it can lead to increased memory usage and potential out-of-memory errors. It is essential to set this configuration carefully based on the system's requirements and available resources."
