The frequency of triggering depends on how often new tables or keyspaces are being created in the cluster.",

Having a large number of tables and keyspaces can significantly slow down these operations. By setting a threshold, the configuration helps to alert clients when the number of tables exceeds a certain limit, allowing them to take action to optimize performance."
