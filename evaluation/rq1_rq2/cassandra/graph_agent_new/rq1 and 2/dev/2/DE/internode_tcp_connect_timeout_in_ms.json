The method tcpConnectTimeoutInMS() returns the value of 'internode_tcp_connect_timeout_in_ms' if it is not null, otherwise it calls getInternodeTcpConnectTimeoutInMS() method to get the value from DatabaseDescriptor.",

By setting a timeout for internode tcp connections, it helps in preventing potential network issues and ensures smoother communication between nodes in the Cassandra cluster."
