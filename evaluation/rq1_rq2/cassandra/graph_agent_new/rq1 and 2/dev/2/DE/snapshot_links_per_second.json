                "developer_understanding_on_unclear_code_to_configuration": "The unclear code is related to the configuration parameter 'snapshot_links_per_second' which is used to throttle the number of links created or removed during snapshot operations. By setting a non-zero value for 'snapshot_links_per_second', the method in the unclear code can throttle the links to avoid performance impact on SSDs."

    "config_description": "The act of creating or clearing a snapshot involves creating or removing potentially tens of thousands of links, which can cause significant performance impact, especially on consumer grade SSDs. A non-zero value here can be used to throttle these links to avoid negative performance impact of taking and clearing snapshots",
    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The configuration 'snapshot_links_per_second' is used to throttle the creation or clearing of snapshot links to avoid negative performance impact on consumer grade SSDs. The 'getSnapshotRateLimiter' method returns a RateLimiter object created with the value of 'snapshot_links_per_second' obtained from 'DatabaseDescriptor.getSnapshotLinksPerSecond()'. This RateLimiter can then be used to control the rate at which snapshot links are processed.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The triggering frequency of the 'snapshot_links_per_second' configuration depends on the frequency at which snapshots are created or cleared in the system. If there are frequent snapshot operations, this configuration will be triggered more often to throttle the links being processed.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the 'snapshot_links_per_second' configuration option is significant in terms of performance optimization. By setting a non-zero value, the system can throttle the creation or clearing of snapshot links to prevent negative performance impacts, especially on consumer grade SSDs. This helps in maintaining system performance and avoiding potential bottlenecks caused by excessive snapshot operations."
