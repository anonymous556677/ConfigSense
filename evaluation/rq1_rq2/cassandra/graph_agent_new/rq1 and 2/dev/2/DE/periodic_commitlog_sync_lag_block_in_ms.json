    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The configuration 'periodic_commitlog_sync_lag_block_in_ms' is used in the code to determine the number of milliseconds to block writes while waiting for a slow disk flush to complete in periodic commitlog mode. It calculates the expected sync time based on the current system time and the configured block time when sync lags.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The configuration is triggered whenever a slow disk flush is detected during the periodic commitlog process. The frequency of triggering depends on the performance of the disk and the workload on the system.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the 'periodic_commitlog_sync_lag_block_in_ms' configuration option is on the write performance of the system. A higher value for this configuration may lead to longer write blocking times, affecting the overall throughput of the system. On the other hand, a lower value may result in more frequent write blocking but potentially better responsiveness."
