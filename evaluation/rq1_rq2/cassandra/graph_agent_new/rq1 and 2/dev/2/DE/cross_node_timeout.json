    "config_description": "Enable operation timeout information exchange between nodes to accurately measure request timeouts.  If disabled, replicas will assume that requests were forwarded to them instantly by the coordinator, which means that under overload conditions we will waste that much extra time processing already-timed-out requests.  Warning: It is generally assumed that users have setup NTP on their clusters, and that clocks are modestly in sync, since this is a requirement for general correctness of last write wins.",
    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The 'cross_node_timeout' configuration is checked in the getExpiresAtNanos method to determine if the operation timeout information exchange between nodes should be enabled. If the DatabaseDescriptor does not have the cross_node_timeout enabled or if the createdAtNanos is greater than the currentTimeNanos, the createdAtNanos is set to the currentTimeNanos. This configuration affects the calculation of the expiration time for a given operation.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The triggering frequency of the 'cross_node_timeout' configuration depends on the usage of the getExpiresAtNanos method in the system. Whenever this method is called to calculate expiration times, the 'cross_node_timeout' configuration is evaluated.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the 'cross_node_timeout' configuration option is significant for accurately measuring request timeouts between nodes. If disabled, replicas will assume instant forwarding of requests by the coordinator, potentially leading to wasted processing time for already-timed-out requests under overload conditions. It is crucial for system performance and correctness, especially in scenarios where NTP synchronization and clock accuracy are essential."
