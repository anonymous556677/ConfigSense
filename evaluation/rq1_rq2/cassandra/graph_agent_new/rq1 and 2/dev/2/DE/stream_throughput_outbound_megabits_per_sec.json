    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The configuration 'stream_throughput_outbound_megabits_per_sec' is used to set the maximum outbound stream throughput in megabits per second for streaming file transfers between datacenters. The code provided includes methods to set and get the value of this configuration, as well as a method to calculate the rate in bytes based on the configured throughput.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The configuration is triggered whenever the 'setStreamThroughputMbPerSec' method is called to update the value of the stream throughput. The frequency of triggering depends on how often this method is invoked in the system.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the 'stream_throughput_outbound_megabits_per_sec' configuration option is significant as it directly affects the rate at which streaming file transfers occur between datacenters. Setting a lower value for this configuration can potentially limit the throughput of inter-datacenter streaming, while setting a higher value can increase the throughput but may also lead to network congestion and resource contention."
