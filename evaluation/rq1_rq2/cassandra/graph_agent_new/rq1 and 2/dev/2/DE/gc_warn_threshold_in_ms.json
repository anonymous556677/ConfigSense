    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The configuration 'gc_warn_threshold_in_ms' is used to set a threshold for logging GC pauses at WARN level. If the GC pause exceeds the threshold, it will be logged at WARN level. The configuration allows developers to adjust the threshold based on the application's throughput requirement. Setting the threshold to 0 will deactivate this feature.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The triggering frequency of the 'gc_warn_threshold_in_ms' configuration depends on the GC pauses during the system's runtime. If the GC pause exceeds the configured threshold, it will trigger the logging at WARN level.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the 'gc_warn_threshold_in_ms' configuration option on the system is that it helps in monitoring and managing GC pauses. By setting an appropriate threshold, developers can control the logging of GC pauses and optimize the system performance based on the application's requirements."
