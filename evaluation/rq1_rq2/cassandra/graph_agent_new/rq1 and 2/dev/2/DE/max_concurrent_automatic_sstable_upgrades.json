    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The configuration 'max_concurrent_automatic_sstable_upgrades' controls the maximum number of concurrent sstable upgrade tasks that can be run automatically. The code checks if there are upgrade tasks available and if the number of currently running upgrade tasks is less than the configured maximum, it executes the upgrade task.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The configuration is triggered whenever the system checks for upgrade tasks and decides whether to run them. The triggering frequency depends on the availability of upgrade tasks and the current number of running tasks.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the 'max_concurrent_automatic_sstable_upgrades' configuration option is that it limits the number of concurrent sstable upgrade tasks that can be run automatically. This can impact the system's performance and resource utilization, as running too many upgrade tasks concurrently can lead to increased load on the system."
