So a small total commitlog space will tend to cause more flush activity on less-active columnfamilies.  The default value is the smaller of 8192, and 1/4 of the total space of the commitlog volume. ",
    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The configuration 'commitlog_total_space_in_mb' is used to determine the total space available for commit logs on disk. It is calculated by multiplying the value of 'DatabaseDescriptor.getTotalCommitlogSpaceInMB()' by 1024 * 1024. The 'unusedCapacity()' method then calculates the remaining unused space by subtracting the current size of the commit log from the total space.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The configuration is triggered whenever the system needs to determine the remaining unused capacity for commit logs. The frequency of triggering depends on the write activity and the size of the commit log segments.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the 'commitlog_total_space_in_mb' configuration option is significant as it determines when Cassandra will flush dirty column families in the oldest segment and remove it if the space exceeds the specified value. A smaller total commit log space will result in more frequent flush activities on less-active column families, potentially affecting the overall performance of the system."
