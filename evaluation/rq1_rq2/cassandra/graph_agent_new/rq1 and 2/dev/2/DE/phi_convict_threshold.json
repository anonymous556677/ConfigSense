    "config_description": "phi value that must be reached for a host to be marked down. most users should never need to adjust this.",
    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The configuration 'phi_convict_threshold' is used in the code to determine the phi value that must be reached for a host to be marked down. The 'getPhiConvictThreshold' method returns the value of 'phi_convict_threshold' from the DatabaseDescriptor.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The configuration is triggered whenever the 'convict' method is called in the code. This method is called when a remote node is suspected to have failed, and the phi value is checked against 2 times the 'phi_convict_threshold' to determine if the node should be marked down.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the 'phi_convict_threshold' configuration option is significant as it determines when a host is marked down due to suspected failure. Setting this value too low may result in false positives, marking hosts down unnecessarily. On the other hand, setting it too high may result in hosts not being marked down even when they are actually failing, leading to potential system issues."
