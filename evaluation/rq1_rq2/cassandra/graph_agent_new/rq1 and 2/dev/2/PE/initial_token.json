    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The initial_token configuration option is performance-sensitive because it directly affects the token assignment for nodes in the cluster, which can have a significant impact on system performance. By manually specifying tokens, it can override automatic allocation and potentially lead to uneven distribution of data across the cluster, causing notable performance variations at the system level. The code context related to initial_token involves operations that are time-expensive and memory-expensive, such as generating bootstrap tokens for new nodes, which further supports its classification as performance-sensitive."
