    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'write_request_timeout_in_ms' configuration is performance-sensitive. This is because it directly impacts the timeout duration for write operations, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The configuration involves time-extensive operations related to calculating timeouts for write operations, and setting it too low or too high can significantly affect system performance by causing premature timeouts or delays in detecting failed writes. Therefore, the configuration is considered performance-sensitive based on its direct and substantial impact on system performance."
