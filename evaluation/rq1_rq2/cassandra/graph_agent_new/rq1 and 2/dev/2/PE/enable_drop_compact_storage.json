    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'enable_drop_compact_storage' does not involve any performance-related operations that are time-extensive or memory-extensive within its related code. It simply checks if 'DROP COMPACT STORAGE' is enabled and throws an exception if it is not. This configuration does not directly and substantially affect system performance at the system level, and therefore does not lead to notable performance variations. The triggering frequency and size impact of this configuration also do not indicate any significant performance impact."
