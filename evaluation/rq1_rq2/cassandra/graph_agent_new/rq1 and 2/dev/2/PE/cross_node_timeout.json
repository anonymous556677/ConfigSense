    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'cross_node_timeout' configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly affects the calculation of expiration times for operations between nodes, which is a critical aspect of system performance. The configuration involves checking the DatabaseDescriptor for the cross_node_timeout setting and comparing timestamps, which are time-expensive operations. If this configuration is not properly enabled, it can lead to wasted processing time for timed-out requests under overload conditions, impacting system performance and correctness. Therefore, the 'cross_node_timeout' configuration has a notable performance impact at the system level, making it performance-sensitive."
