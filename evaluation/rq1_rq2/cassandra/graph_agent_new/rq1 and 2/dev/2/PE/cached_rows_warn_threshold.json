    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'cached_rows_warn_threshold' configuration is performance-sensitive. This is because it directly impacts the query performance by limiting the number of rows that can be materialized on-heap during queries. If the threshold is breached, it can lead to warnings being logged or even query failures, indicating a notable performance variation at the system level. Additionally, the configuration involves performance-related operations such as setting thresholds and checking for breaches within the ReplicaFilteringProtection class, which contribute to time-expensive operations and memory consumption."
