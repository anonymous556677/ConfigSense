    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'num_tokens' configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the proportion of data stored by a node in the cluster, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Having more tokens relative to other nodes can result in unbalanced data distribution and suboptimal performance. This configuration involves performance-related operations that are memory-expensive, as it affects the memory usage of each node in the cluster. Therefore, the 'num_tokens' configuration is considered performance-sensitive based on its impact on system performance and memory consumption."
