    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'internode_application_send_queue_reserve_global_capacity_in_bytes' is classified as performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly impacts the system performance by setting limits on queued messages for delivery between nodes in the cluster. The size of messages queued for delivery can have a significant impact on memory usage and potentially lead to performance issues. Additionally, the configuration involves setting limits at different levels (per-link, per-endpoint, and global), which can result in notable performance variations at the system level based on the volume of messages being sent and received."
