    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'memtable_heap_space_in_mb' is classified as performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly impacts the total memory used for memtables in Cassandra, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The code snippet provided shows how the configuration value is used to set the heapLimit for the MemtablePool, which is a time-expensive operation. If the memory limit is not set appropriately, it can result in frequent flushes or out-of-memory errors, significantly affecting system performance."
