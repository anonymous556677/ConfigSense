    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'ideal_consistency_level' configuration option is classified as performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration involves additional tracking and comparison logic for write responses to ensure that the ideal consistency level is achieved. This additional logic can introduce overhead in terms of processing and memory usage, especially when tracking multiple write operations across keyspaces. As a result, the configuration directly and substantially affects system performance at the system level, leading to notable performance variations. The performance-related operations within the configuration code contribute to increased execution time and memory consumption, making it performance-sensitive."
