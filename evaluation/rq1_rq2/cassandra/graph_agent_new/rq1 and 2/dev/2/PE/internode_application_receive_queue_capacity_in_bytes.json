    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'internode_application_receive_queue_capacity_in_bytes' is performance-sensitive. This is because it directly impacts the amount of memory consumed by queued messages in the system, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The configuration involves setting limits on message sizes for delivery and processing, which are time-expensive and memory-expensive operations. Setting this configuration too low can result in message loss or delays, while setting it too high can lead to increased memory usage and resource contention, both of which have significant performance implications."
