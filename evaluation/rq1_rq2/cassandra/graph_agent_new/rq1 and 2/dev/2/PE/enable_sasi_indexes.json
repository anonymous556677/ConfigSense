    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'enable_sasi_indexes' configuration option is classified as performance-sensitive. This is because enabling SASI indexes can have a notable impact on system performance and resource usage, as mentioned by the developer. The code snippet provided checks for the configuration in the cassandra.yaml file before allowing the creation of SASI indexes, indicating that the configuration directly affects the system's performance at the system level. Additionally, SASI indexes are considered experimental and may have performance implications, making it important to monitor the system after enabling them. Therefore, the configuration involves performance-related operations that are time-expensive and memory-expensive, leading to notable performance variations at the system level."
