    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'streaming_keep_alive_period_in_secs' is performance-sensitive. This is because the setting directly impacts the frequency of keep-alive messages exchanged between nodes, which can have a significant effect on system performance. A shorter period may increase resource usage and potentially lead to higher communication overhead, while a longer period may result in session timeouts and failures. The code context related to this configuration involves scheduling a keep-alive task at a fixed rate based on the specified period, indicating that the operation is time-expensive and can lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
