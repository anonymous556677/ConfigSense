    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'index_summary_resize_interval_in_minutes' is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the memory redistribution process in the system, which can lead to notable performance variations. The resampling process triggered by this configuration involves time-expensive operations that redistribute memory from the fixed-size pool to sstables based on their read rates. Changing the interval at which this process occurs can have a substantial effect on system performance, making it a performance-sensitive configuration."
