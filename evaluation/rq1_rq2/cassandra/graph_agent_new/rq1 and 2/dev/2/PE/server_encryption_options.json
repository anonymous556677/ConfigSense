    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'server_encryption_options' is classified as performance-sensitive. This is because the code related to this configuration involves setting up server-to-server internode encryption, initializing SSL contexts, creating SSL connections, and handling hot reloading of SSL certificates. These operations are time-expensive and memory-expensive, directly impacting system performance at the system level. The configuration ensures secure communication between nodes and protects data in transit, making it crucial for system security. However, customizing encryption options should be done carefully to avoid insecure configurations that could potentially impact system performance negatively."
