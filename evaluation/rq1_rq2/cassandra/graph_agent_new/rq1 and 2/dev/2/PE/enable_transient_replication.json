{
    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'enable_transient_replication' is considered performance-sensitive. Enabling transient replication can have a notable impact on system performance and resource usage, as mentioned by the developer. The configuration involves validation checks and replication strategy setup, which are time-expensive operations. Additionally, the developer warns that enabling transient replication may introduce instability or unexpected behavior in the system, indicating a substantial impact on system performance. Therefore, based on the code context and developer's information, it is clear that the configuration directly and substantially affects system performance at the system level, making it performance-sensitive."
