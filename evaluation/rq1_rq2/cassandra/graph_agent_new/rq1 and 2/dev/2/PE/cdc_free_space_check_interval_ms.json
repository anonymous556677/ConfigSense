    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'cdc_free_space_check_interval_ms' is performance-sensitive. This is because the interval at which the system checks for available space for cdc-tracked tables directly impacts the system's performance. A shorter interval leads to more frequent checks, potentially increasing resource consumption and affecting system performance. On the other hand, a longer interval may delay the detection of available space, also impacting system performance. Therefore, the configuration involves performance-related operations that are time-expensive and memory-expensive, leading to notable performance variations at the system level."
