    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'counter_cache_size_in_mb' configuration is classified as performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly impacts system performance by determining the maximum size of the counter cache in memory. The size of the cache can significantly affect memory consumption and the efficiency of cache operations, which are time-expensive. The code initializes the cache with the specified capacity and schedules periodic key saving based on the configured save period, indicating that the configuration involves performance-related operations that contribute to notable performance variations at the system level."
