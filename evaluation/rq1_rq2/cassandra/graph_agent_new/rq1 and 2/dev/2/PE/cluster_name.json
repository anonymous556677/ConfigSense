    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The 'cluster_name' configuration option is not performance-sensitive. The developer's information indicates that this configuration is used to retrieve the name of the cluster from the DatabaseDescriptor to prevent machines in one logical cluster from joining another. The configuration is triggered when the 'getClusterName()' method is called, and it has minimal impact on system size as it only retrieves the cluster name without involving significant data processing or storage. Since the configuration does not involve any time-expensive or memory-expensive operations within its related code and does not lead to notable performance variations at the system level, it is classified as not performance-sensitive."
