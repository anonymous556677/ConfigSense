    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'enable_user_defined_functions' is performance-sensitive. Enabling this configuration allows the system to use user-defined functions, which can introduce security risks if not properly managed. Additionally, the configuration involves checking and enabling user-defined functions at the system level using the method DatabaseDescriptor.enableUserDefinedFunctions(). This operation can have a notable performance impact depending on the complexity and efficiency of the user-defined functions being used. Therefore, the configuration directly and substantially affects system performance, making it performance-sensitive."
