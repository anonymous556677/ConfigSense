    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'stream_throughput_outbound_megabits_per_sec' is performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly affects the rate of streaming file transfers between datacenters, which can have a substantial impact on system performance. The code provided includes methods that handle the setting and getting of the configuration value, as well as a method to calculate the rate in bytes based on the configured throughput. These operations are time-expensive and memory-expensive, contributing significantly to system performance variations. Therefore, the configuration is considered performance-sensitive as it involves performance-related operations that have a notable impact on system performance at the system level."
