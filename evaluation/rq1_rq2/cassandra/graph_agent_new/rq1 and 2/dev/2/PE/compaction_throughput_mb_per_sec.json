{
    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'compaction_throughput_mb_per_sec' is performance-sensitive because it directly controls the rate limit for compaction operations, which are time-expensive and memory-expensive processes. By setting this configuration, the system's overall performance can be significantly impacted as it affects the speed and efficiency of compaction operations. Therefore, any changes in this configuration can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, making it a performance-sensitive configuration."
