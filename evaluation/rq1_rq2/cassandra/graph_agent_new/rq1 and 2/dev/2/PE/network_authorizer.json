    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The network_authorizer configuration is performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly impacts user access control to data centers, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The use of AllowAllNetworkAuthorizer or CassandraNetworkAuthorizer involves performance-related operations that determine user permissions, which are time-expensive and memory-expensive. The configuration is triggered frequently whenever a user attempts to access a data center, making it crucial for system performance. Additionally, the size impact of the configuration is significant as it directly affects the level of access control for users, further emphasizing its performance sensitivity."
