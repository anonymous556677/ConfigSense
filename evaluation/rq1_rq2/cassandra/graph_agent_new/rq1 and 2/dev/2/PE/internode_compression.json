{
    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'internode_compression' configuration is classified as performance-sensitive because it directly impacts system performance at the system level. The configuration involves time-expensive operations related to compressing traffic between nodes, which can significantly affect network bandwidth usage and CPU utilization. The triggering frequency of the configuration is also dependent on the number of connections between nodes and the setting in DatabaseDescriptor, indicating that it can lead to notable performance variations. Therefore, based on the code context and provided information, the 'internode_compression' configuration is considered performance-sensitive."
