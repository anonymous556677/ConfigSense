    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'dynamic_snitch_reset_interval_in_ms' is not performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the configuration is mainly used to schedule tasks for updating and resetting the dynamic endpoint snitch based on a configured interval. While it plays a crucial role in maintaining system health and performance by allowing bad hosts to recover, it does not directly involve any time-extensive or memory-extensive operations that would lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Therefore, the configuration does not have a significant impact on system performance."
