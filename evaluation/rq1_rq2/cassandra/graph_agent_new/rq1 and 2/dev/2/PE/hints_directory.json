    "classification_result": "Performance-insensitive with 100% confidence",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'Directory where Cassandra should store hints' is performance-insensitive because it only specifies the directory location for storing hints. It does not involve any performance-related operations or affect system performance, and is unrelated to any time-dependent aspects of system operation."
