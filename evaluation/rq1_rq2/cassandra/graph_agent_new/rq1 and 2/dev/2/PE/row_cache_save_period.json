    "classification_result": "Performance-insensitive with 100% confidence",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'Duration in seconds after which Cassandra should save the row cache' is performance-insensitive because it only determines when the row cache should be saved, which does not directly impact system performance. It is related to cache management and does not involve any time-dependent aspects of system operation."
