    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The 'start_native_transport' configuration option does not involve any performance-related operations that are time-extensive or memory-extensive within its related code. The configuration simply determines whether the native transport server is started or not based on the value of the system property 'cassandra.start_native_transport' and the return value of the DatabaseDescriptor.startNativeTransport() method. This decision does not directly and substantially affect system performance at the system level, and therefore the configuration is not considered performance-sensitive."
