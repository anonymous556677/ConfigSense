    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'batch_size_warn_threshold_in_kb' is not performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the configuration does not directly involve any time-expensive or memory-expensive operations within its related code. While adjusting the threshold value may impact system stability, it does not lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The configuration is triggered based on a specific condition (batch size exceeding the threshold) but does not have a significant impact on overall system performance."
