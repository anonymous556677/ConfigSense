    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'internode_application_send_queue_capacity_in_bytes' is classified as performance-sensitive. This is because the size of messages queued for delivery between nodes in the cluster directly impacts the overall message processing and delivery efficiency within the cluster. The configuration involves setting limits on the on-wire size of messages being sent or received, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Additionally, the code context shows that the configuration is triggered whenever the application needs to send or receive messages to or from other nodes in the cluster, indicating that it plays a crucial role in communication activities within the cluster."
