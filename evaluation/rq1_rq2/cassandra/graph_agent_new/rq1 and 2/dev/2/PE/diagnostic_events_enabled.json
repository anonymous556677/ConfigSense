    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'diagnostic_events_enabled' is classified as performance-sensitive. This is because enabling diagnostic events can have a significant impact on system performance by capturing and processing additional event details, which can increase resource usage and potentially affect system responsiveness. The configuration is checked in multiple methods to decide whether to publish events or not, indicating that it involves performance-related operations that are time-expensive and memory-expensive. Therefore, it directly and substantially affects system performance at the system level, leading to notable performance variations."
