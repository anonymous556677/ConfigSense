    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'role_manager' configuration is performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly impacts the security and access control of the system, which are critical aspects of system performance. The 'role_manager' configuration involves managing user roles, permissions, and grants, which are operations that can be time-expensive and memory-expensive. These operations are triggered frequently during authentication and authorization operations, such as login, role creation, and permission checks. Any inefficiencies in the 'role_manager' configuration can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, affecting the overall performance of the system."
