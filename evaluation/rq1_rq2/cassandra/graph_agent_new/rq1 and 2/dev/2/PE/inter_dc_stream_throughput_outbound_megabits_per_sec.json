    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'inter_dc_stream_throughput_outbound_megabits_per_sec' is performance-sensitive. This is because it directly affects the rate at which streaming file transfers occur between datacenters, leading to notable performance variations at the system level. The code provided includes methods to set and get the value of this configuration, as well as a method to calculate the rate in bytes based on the configured throughput, indicating that it involves time-expensive operations. Additionally, the impact of this configuration is significant as it can potentially reduce network congestion and improve overall system performance, further emphasizing its performance sensitivity."
