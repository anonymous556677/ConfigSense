    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'internode_tcp_connect_timeout_in_ms' is not performance-sensitive. The developer's information indicates that this configuration is mainly used for setting a timeout for internode tcp connections in Cassandra to prevent network issues and ensure smoother communication between nodes. While it may have an impact on the system's network communication, it does not involve any time-expensive or memory-expensive operations within its related code that would lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
