    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'repair_session_space_in_mb' configuration is classified as performance-sensitive. This is because it directly impacts memory usage during repair operations, which can lead to heap pressure and potential over-streaming of data if set too low, or unnecessary memory consumption if set too high. The configuration involves memory-expensive operations related to Merkle tree calculations, which can significantly affect system performance at the system level. Therefore, any notable changes in this configuration can lead to notable performance variations in the system."
