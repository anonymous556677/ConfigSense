    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'allocate_tokens_for_keyspace' configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly affects the token allocation strategy, which in turn impacts the distribution of data across cluster nodes. This can lead to significant performance variations at the system level, especially in terms of performance and load balancing. The code related to this configuration involves operations that are time-expensive and memory-expensive, such as determining token allocation algorithm and choosing tokens at random, which can have a notable impact on system performance."
