    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The rpc_keepalive configuration is performance-sensitive. Enabling or disabling keepalive on rpc/native connections directly impacts the system's network performance and resource utilization. This configuration involves performance-related operations that are time-expensive and memory-expensive within its related code. Enabling keepalive can help maintain persistent connections and reduce connection setup overhead, but it may also consume more resources. Disabling keepalive may save resources but could result in more frequent connection setups. These operations lead to notable performance variations at the system level, making the configuration performance-sensitive."
