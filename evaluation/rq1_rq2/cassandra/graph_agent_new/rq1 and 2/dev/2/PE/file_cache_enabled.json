    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'file_cache_enabled' configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts system performance by storing recently accessed sections of the sstable in-memory as uncompressed buffers, which can significantly improve read performance by reducing the need to read from disk for frequently accessed data. The configuration involves time-expensive operations related to caching and memory-expensive operations related to storing data in-memory, leading to notable performance variations at the system level."
