    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'streaming_connections_per_host' configuration is considered performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly impacts the number of connections per host for streaming, which can have a substantial effect on system performance at the system level. Additionally, the configuration involves time-extensive operations related to streaming, such as limiting the number of connections per host, which can lead to notable performance variations. Therefore, the configuration is classified as performance-sensitive based on its direct and substantial impact on system performance and the presence of time-extensive operations within its related code."
