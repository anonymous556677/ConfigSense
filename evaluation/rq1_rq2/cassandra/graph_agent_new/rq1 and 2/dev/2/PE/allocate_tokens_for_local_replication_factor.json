    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'allocate_tokens_for_local_replication_factor' configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly affects the token allocation process for new nodes in the cluster and the replication factor within the datacenter. The code snippet related to this configuration involves operations that are time-expensive and memory-expensive, such as generating suitable tokens based on the allocation local replica factor. This can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, making it a critical configuration for system performance."
