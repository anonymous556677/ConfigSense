    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The 'internode_authenticator' configuration option does not involve any performance-related operations that are time-expensive or memory-expensive within its related code. The configuration mainly focuses on setting the internode authenticator and determining the authentication backend used for allowing or disallowing connections from peer nodes. While the configuration is important for security reasons, it does not directly and substantially affect system performance at the system level in terms of notable performance variations. Therefore, it is classified as not performance-sensitive."
