    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'incremental_backups' is performance-sensitive. This is because enabling this configuration option leads to the creation of hard links to SSTables, which can impact disk space usage and potentially increase storage requirements. Additionally, the creation of hard links may impact system performance due to the additional file operations involved. These performance-related operations directly and substantially affect system performance at the system level, making the configuration performance-sensitive."
