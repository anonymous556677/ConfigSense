    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'repaired_data_tracking_for_range_reads_enabled' is classified as performance-sensitive. This is because enabling the configuration adds overhead to range read operations by tracking repaired data, which can impact system performance significantly, especially when there are frequent range read operations with multiple full replicas. This directly affects system performance at the system level by introducing time-expensive and memory-expensive operations within the code related to the configuration. Therefore, the notable performance variations caused by this configuration make it performance-sensitive."
