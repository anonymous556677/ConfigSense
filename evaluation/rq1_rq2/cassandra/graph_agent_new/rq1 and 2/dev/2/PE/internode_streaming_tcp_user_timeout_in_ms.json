    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'internode_streaming_tcp_user_timeout_in_ms' is performance-sensitive. This is because the setting directly impacts the timeout for processing incoming stream messages, which can significantly affect the performance of streaming connections at the system level. The code snippet that checks this configuration value is crucial for determining the timeout, and any changes to this setting can lead to notable performance variations in terms of execution time and memory consumption."
