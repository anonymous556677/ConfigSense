    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'client_encryption_options' is classified as performance-sensitive. This is because it directly impacts system performance by setting up client-to-server encryption, which involves resource-intensive operations like creating SSL contexts and checking SSL certificates. These operations contribute significantly to execution time and memory consumption, leading to notable performance variations at the system level. Additionally, the configuration is triggered during the initialization of the SSLFactory class and periodic hot reloading of SSL certificates, further emphasizing its performance sensitivity."
