    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'enable_materialized_views' configuration option is considered performance-sensitive. This is because enabling this configuration directly impacts the system performance by allowing the creation of materialized views, which can be time-expensive and memory-expensive operations. The developer's information also indicates that materialized views are experimental and may have performance implications depending on their number and complexity. Additionally, the configuration is checked and triggered frequently in the code whenever materialized views are created or updated, further emphasizing its performance sensitivity."
