    "Reason": "The 'commit_failure_policy' configuration option is not performance-sensitive. Although the configuration can have significant impacts on system availability and reliability, it does not involve any performance-related operations that are time-expensive or memory-expensive within its related code. The handleCommitError method simply inspects the policy set in the DatabaseDescriptor and takes appropriate actions based on the policy, without causing notable performance variations at the system level."
