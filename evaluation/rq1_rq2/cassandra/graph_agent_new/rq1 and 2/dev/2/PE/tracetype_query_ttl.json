    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The 'tracetype_query_ttl' configuration is not performance-sensitive. The configuration is mainly focused on setting the TTL for different trace types during the logging of the repair process. While it may impact storage size due to longer duration of tracing information storage, it does not directly involve any time-expensive or memory-expensive operations that would lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The configuration's impact is more on storage space rather than system performance."
