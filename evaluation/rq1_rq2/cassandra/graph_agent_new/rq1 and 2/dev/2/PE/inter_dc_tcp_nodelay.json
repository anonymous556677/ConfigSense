    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'inter_dc_tcp_nodelay' is considered performance-sensitive. Enabling or disabling tcp_nodelay for inter-dc communication directly impacts network packet size and latency, which can have significant performance implications at the system level. The code context provided indicates that this configuration involves performance-related operations that can be time-expensive and memory-expensive, leading to notable performance variations. Additionally, the triggering frequency of this configuration depends on the frequency of inter-dc communication, indicating its potential impact on system performance."
