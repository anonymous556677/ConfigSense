    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The 'authenticator' configuration primarily deals with user authentication and authorization, which are essential operations for the system's security and functionality. While these operations may have some impact on performance, they are not considered time-expensive or memory-expensive enough to cause notable performance variations at the system level. The code related to the 'authenticator' configuration focuses on handling user credentials and login privileges, which are necessary for system security but do not involve operations that significantly impact performance. Therefore, based on the provided information and code context, the 'authenticator' configuration is classified as not performance-sensitive."
