    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The dynamic_snitch_badness_threshold configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly affects the behavior of the dynamic snitch in preferring replicas based on the badness threshold set. This can lead to notable performance variations at the system level by potentially improving system performance through avoiding slow replicas. The configuration involves performance-related operations that are time-extensive within its related code, as it determines how much worse a pinned host has to be before the dynamic snitch will prefer other replicas over it. Therefore, the configuration has a substantial impact on system performance and is considered performance-sensitive."
