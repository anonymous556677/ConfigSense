    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'commitlog_total_space_in_mb' configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts system performance at the system level. The calculation of the total space available for commit logs on disk and the subsequent determination of remaining unused capacity involve time-expensive operations that can lead to notable performance variations. The configuration's impact on when Cassandra flushes dirty column families and removes old segments based on the specified value also highlights its significance in affecting the overall performance of the system."
