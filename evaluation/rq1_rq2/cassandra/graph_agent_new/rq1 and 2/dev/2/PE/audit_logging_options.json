    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The audit_logging_options configuration is performance-sensitive because enabling audit logging adds overhead to log every incoming CQL command request and authentication event. This can potentially impact system performance and resource usage, especially if a large volume of requests is being logged. The configuration involves performance-related operations that are time-expensive (logging every request) and memory-expensive (storing logs), leading to notable performance variations at the system level."
