    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'batch_size_fail_threshold_in_kb' is performance-sensitive. This is because it directly impacts the processing of multiple-partition batches, which can have a significant effect on system performance. The threshold set by this configuration determines when a batch will fail, and exceeding this threshold can lead to performance issues or failures in the system. The code snippet related to this configuration involves time-extensive operations such as retrieving the threshold value and checking if a batch exceeds it, which can contribute to notable performance variations at the system level."
