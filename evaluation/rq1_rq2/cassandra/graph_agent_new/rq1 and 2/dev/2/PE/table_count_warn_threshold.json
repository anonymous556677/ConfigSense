{
    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'table_count_warn_threshold' configuration is classified as performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the performance of schema-dependent cluster operations at the system level. The configuration involves setting a threshold for the number of tables in the cluster, and exceeding this threshold can significantly slow down operations. The configuration triggers a warning message when creating a table or keyspace, indicating that it involves time-expensive operations that can lead to notable performance variations. Therefore, the configuration is considered performance-sensitive due to its direct and substantial effect on system performance."
