    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'key_cache_size_in_mb' configuration option is classified as performance-sensitive. This is because the size of the key cache directly impacts the system's performance at the system level. The configuration involves initializing the key cache object with a specified capacity, which can significantly affect memory usage and the number of seeks required for cache hits. Therefore, changes in the 'key_cache_size_in_mb' value can lead to notable performance variations in terms of memory consumption and execution time, making it a performance-sensitive configuration."
