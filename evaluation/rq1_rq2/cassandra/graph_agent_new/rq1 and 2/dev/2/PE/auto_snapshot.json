    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The 'auto_snapshot' configuration does not involve any performance-related operations that are time-expensive or memory-expensive within its related code. The primary purpose of this configuration is to determine whether a snapshot is taken for data safety before keyspace truncation or dropping of column families. While data safety is important, the configuration itself does not directly and substantially affect system performance at the system level. Therefore, it is not considered performance-sensitive."
