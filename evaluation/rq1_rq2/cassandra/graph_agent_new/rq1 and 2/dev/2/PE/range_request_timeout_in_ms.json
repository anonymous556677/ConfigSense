    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'range_request_timeout_in_ms' is performance-sensitive. This is because it directly affects the maximum time the coordinator will wait for scans to complete, which can have a significant impact on system performance. If this value is set too low, it may result in premature termination of scans, leading to incomplete results and potential performance bottlenecks. On the other hand, setting it too high can increase latency in handling range requests, impacting overall system responsiveness. The code context where this configuration is used, specifically in the method getRangeRpcTimeout() from the DatabaseDescriptor class, indicates that it involves time-expensive operations related to scan completion, further emphasizing its performance sensitivity."
