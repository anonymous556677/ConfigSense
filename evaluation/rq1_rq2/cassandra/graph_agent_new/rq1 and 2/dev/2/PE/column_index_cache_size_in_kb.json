    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'column_index_cache_size_in_kb' is performance-sensitive because it directly affects the memory usage and performance of the system at the system level. The size limit set by this configuration determines whether sstable indexed key cache entries are held in heap memory or read from disk, impacting the overall system performance. Additionally, the triggering frequency of this configuration depends on the size of cache entries, indicating that it involves time-expensive operations within its related code that can lead to notable performance variations."
