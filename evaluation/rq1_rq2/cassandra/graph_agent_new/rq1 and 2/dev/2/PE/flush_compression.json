    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'flush_compression' configuration is classified as performance-sensitive because it directly impacts system performance at the system level. The configuration involves selecting a compression algorithm for flushing SSTables, which can significantly affect the performance of the system, especially for large tables. The choice of compression algorithm can lead to notable performance variations, as high ratio compressors like LZ4HC, Zstd, and Deflate can potentially block flushes for too long, impacting overall system performance. The code snippet provided checks the 'flush_compression' configuration value and decides which compression algorithm to use during the flushing process, indicating that the configuration is tied to performance-related operations that are time-expensive and memory-expensive."
