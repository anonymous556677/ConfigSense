{
    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'counter_write_request_timeout_in_ms' is performance-sensitive. This is because the timeout value directly impacts the execution time of counter write operations at the system level. If the timeout value is set too low, it can lead to timeouts for long-running counter write operations, affecting system performance. Additionally, the configuration involves time-extensive operations related to waiting for counter writes to complete, which can significantly impact system performance. Therefore, the configuration is considered performance-sensitive based on its direct and substantial effect on system performance."
