    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'internode_socket_send_buffer_size_in_bytes' is classified as performance-sensitive. This is because the size of the socket buffer for internode communication directly impacts the performance and efficiency of data transmission between nodes at the system level. The configuration code also involves retrieving the buffer size value, which can be time-expensive and memory-expensive operations. Therefore, any changes in this configuration can lead to notable performance variations in the system."
