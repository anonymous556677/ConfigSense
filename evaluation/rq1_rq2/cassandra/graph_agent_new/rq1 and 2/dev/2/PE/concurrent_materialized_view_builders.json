    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'concurrent_materialized_view_builders' configuration is performance-sensitive. This is because setting the number of simultaneous materialized view builder tasks directly impacts the system's performance at the system level. If this value is set too low, it can result in slower view building processes, while setting it too high can consume more system resources. Additionally, the CompactionManager class methods related to this configuration involve performance-related operations that are time-expensive and memory-expensive, leading to notable performance variations at the system level."
