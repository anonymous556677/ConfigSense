    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'cdc_total_space_in_mb' configuration is performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly impacts the system performance at the system level by determining the total space available for change-data-capture logs on disk. The calculation of allowable space involves multiplying a value obtained from DatabaseDescriptor by a large factor (1024*1024), which can lead to notable performance variations. Additionally, exceeding the configured total space limit can result in WriteTimeoutException on Mutations for tables with CDC enabled, leading to data loss and system instability. Therefore, the configuration involves performance-related operations that are time-expensive and memory-expensive, making it performance-sensitive."
