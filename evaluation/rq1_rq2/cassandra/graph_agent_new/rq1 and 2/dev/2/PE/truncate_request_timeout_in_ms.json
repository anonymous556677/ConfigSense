    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The 'truncate_request_timeout_in_ms' configuration option is not performance-sensitive. Although it directly impacts the timeout value for truncates to complete, the configuration itself does not involve any time-expensive or memory-expensive operations within its related code. The code snippet using this configuration simply calculates the timeout for truncates and throws a TimeoutException if the operation does not complete within the specified timeout. Since the configuration does not lead to notable performance variations at the system level and does not involve any performance-related operations that are time-extensive or memory-extensive, it is classified as not performance-sensitive."
