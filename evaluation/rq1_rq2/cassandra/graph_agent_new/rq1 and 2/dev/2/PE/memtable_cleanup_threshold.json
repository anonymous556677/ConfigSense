    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'memtable_cleanup_threshold' is performance-sensitive. This is because it directly impacts the system performance by determining when a flush of the largest memtable will occur, which in turn affects disk performance under heavy write load. The code context provided by the developer indicates that this configuration involves time-expensive operations related to memtable size calculations and triggering flushes, leading to notable performance variations at the system level."
