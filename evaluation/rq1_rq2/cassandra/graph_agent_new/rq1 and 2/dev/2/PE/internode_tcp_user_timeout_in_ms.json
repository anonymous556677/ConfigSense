    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'internode_tcp_user_timeout_in_ms' configuration is classified as performance-sensitive because it directly affects system performance at the system level. The configuration is crucial for establishing internode TCP connections within a specified time limit to prevent network issues and improve system reliability. The code snippet related to the configuration involves time-expensive operations to check and set the timeout value based on connection category, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level when establishing new connections. Therefore, the configuration's impact on system performance is substantial, making it performance-sensitive."
