    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'internode_application_send_queue_reserve_endpoint_capacity_in_bytes' is performance-sensitive. This is because it directly impacts the size of messages being sent or received on the wire, which can have a significant effect on system performance. The configuration involves setting limits for messages queued for delivery to other nodes, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Additionally, the code context provided by the developer indicates that the configuration involves performance-related operations that are time-expensive and memory-expensive, further supporting its classification as performance-sensitive."
