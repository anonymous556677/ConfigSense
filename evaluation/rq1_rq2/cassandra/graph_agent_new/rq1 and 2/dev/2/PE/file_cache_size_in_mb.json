    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'file_cache_size_in_mb' configuration is performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly affects the amount of memory allocated for sstable chunk cache and buffer pooling, which can have a significant impact on system performance. The developer's explanation indicates that a larger value for this configuration can improve read performance but consume more system memory, while a smaller value may lead to more frequent disk reads. Additionally, the triggering frequency of this configuration during the initialization of the ChunkCache instance shows that it has a direct impact on system performance at the system level."
