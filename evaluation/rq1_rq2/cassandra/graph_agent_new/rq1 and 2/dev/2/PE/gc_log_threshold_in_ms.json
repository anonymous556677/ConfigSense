    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'gc_log_threshold_in_ms' is not performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the configuration does not directly involve any time-extensive or memory-extensive operations within its related code. It simply sets a threshold for logging GC pauses and adjusts the amount of logging related to GC pauses. While it may impact the amount of logging generated, it does not lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Therefore, it is considered to have a trivial performance impact and is not classified as performance-sensitive."
