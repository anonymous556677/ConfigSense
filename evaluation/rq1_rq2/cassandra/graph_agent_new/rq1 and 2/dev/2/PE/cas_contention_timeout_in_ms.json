    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'cas_contention_timeout_in_ms' is performance-sensitive because it directly affects the behavior of CAS operations in the system. The timeout value set by this configuration determines how long a coordinator should continue to retry a CAS operation that contends with other proposals for the same row. This directly impacts the execution time and memory consumption of CAS operations, as a lower value may result in more retries and increased contention handling overhead, while a higher value may increase the overall latency of CAS operations. Therefore, the configuration involves performance-related operations that are time-extensive and memory-extensive, leading to notable performance variations at the system level."
