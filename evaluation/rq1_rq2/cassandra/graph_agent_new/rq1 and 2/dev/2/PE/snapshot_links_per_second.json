{
    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'snapshot_links_per_second' is classified as performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the configuration directly impacts system performance by throttling the creation or clearing of snapshot links to prevent negative performance impacts on consumer grade SSDs. The 'getSnapshotRateLimiter' method uses the value of 'snapshot_links_per_second' to create a RateLimiter object, which controls the rate at which snapshot links are processed. This configuration involves time-expensive operations that significantly affect system performance at the system level, making it performance-sensitive."
