    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'cached_rows_fail_threshold' configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the fail threshold for cached replica rows, which can significantly affect system performance. The configuration involves setting a threshold that determines when cached replica rows should fail, and this can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Additionally, the configuration is used in the resolveWithReplicaFilteringProtection method, which suggests that it is involved in performance-related operations that are time-expensive and memory-expensive within the code."
