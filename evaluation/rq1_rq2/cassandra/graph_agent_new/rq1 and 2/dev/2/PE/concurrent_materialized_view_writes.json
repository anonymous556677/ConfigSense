    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'concurrent_materialized_view_writes' configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly affects system performance by managing materialized views for a single ColumnFamilyStore. This configuration involves locks to prevent incoherent updates in the view, which can be time-expensive and memory-expensive operations. The configuration impacts the system level performance by ensuring data integrity and coherence in materialized views, making it crucial for system efficiency. Therefore, the configuration is classified as performance-sensitive."
