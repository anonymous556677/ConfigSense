    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'stream_entire_sstables' is performance-sensitive. This is because enabling this configuration directly impacts system performance by allowing Cassandra to zero-copy stream entire eligible SSTables between nodes, which can significantly speed up network transfers subject to throttling. This operation involves time-expensive network transfers and memory-expensive zero-copy operations, leading to notable performance variations at the system level. Additionally, the configuration involves performance-related operations within the code that contribute positively to execution time and memory consumption, making it a performance-sensitive configuration."
