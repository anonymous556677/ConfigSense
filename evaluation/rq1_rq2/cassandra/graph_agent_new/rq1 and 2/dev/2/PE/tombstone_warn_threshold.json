    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'tombstone_warn_threshold' configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly affects system performance by adjusting the thresholds for scanning tombstones in memory. This can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, especially in terms of memory usage. Additionally, the method 'getTombstoneWarnThreshold()' is called frequently in the code, indicating that this configuration is actively used and can have a significant impact on performance."
