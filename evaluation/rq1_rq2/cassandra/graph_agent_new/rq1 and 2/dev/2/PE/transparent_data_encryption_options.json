    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'transparent_data_encryption_options' configuration is classified as performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration involves encryption and decryption operations that are time-expensive and memory-expensive. Encrypting data at-rest can significantly impact system performance by increasing CPU and I/O usage, which can affect system throughput and latency. The configuration directly and substantially affects system performance at the system level, making it performance-sensitive."
