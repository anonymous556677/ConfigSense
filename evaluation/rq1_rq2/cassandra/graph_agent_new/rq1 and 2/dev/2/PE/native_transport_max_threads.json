    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'native_transport_max_threads' configuration is classified as performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly impacts the system's performance by setting the maximum number of threads for handling requests in the native transport. The use of this configuration involves time-expensive operations related to thread management and concurrency handling, which can significantly affect the system's performance at the system level. The developer's explanation also highlights the importance of configuring this value optimally to avoid performance bottlenecks or resource inefficiencies, further emphasizing its performance sensitivity."
