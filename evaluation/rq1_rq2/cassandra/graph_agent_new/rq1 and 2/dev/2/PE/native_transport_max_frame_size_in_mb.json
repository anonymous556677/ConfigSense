    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'native_transport_max_frame_size_in_mb' is classified as performance-sensitive. This is because changing the frame size limit directly impacts the system performance and resource utilization. Increasing the limit can lead to higher memory usage and potential performance degradation, while decreasing it may result in rejected frames and communication issues. The configuration involves performance-related operations that are memory-expensive within its related code, leading to notable performance variations at the system level."
