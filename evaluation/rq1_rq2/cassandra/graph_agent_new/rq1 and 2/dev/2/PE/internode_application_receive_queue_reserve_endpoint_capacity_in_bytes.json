    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'internode_application_receive_queue_reserve_endpoint_capacity_in_bytes' is classified as performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly impacts the memory utilization of the system by limiting the amount of memory that can be consumed by queued messages at the per-endpoint level. Setting this configuration to an inappropriate value can lead to message loss, dropped connections, increased memory usage, and potential performance degradation due to memory contention. The configuration involves memory-expensive operations that directly affect system performance at the system level, making it performance-sensitive."
