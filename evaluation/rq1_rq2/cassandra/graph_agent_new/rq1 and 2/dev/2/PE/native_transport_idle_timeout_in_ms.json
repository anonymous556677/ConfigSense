    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'native_transport_idle_timeout_in_ms' configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts system performance by managing idle client connections. The code related to this configuration involves time-expensive operations such as checking for idle connections and closing them after a specified timeout. These operations can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, especially if the timeout value is set too low, causing frequent connection closures and reopenings. Therefore, the configuration's impact on system performance makes it performance-sensitive."
