    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'tombstone_failure_threshold' is performance-sensitive. The 'getTombstoneFailureThreshold' method is called whenever the tombstone failure threshold value is needed in the system, indicating that this configuration directly impacts system performance. The configuration determines the threshold for the number of tombstones scanned in a query, and if the number exceeds this threshold, it can lead to a TombstoneOverwhelmingException being thrown, affecting query execution and potentially system performance. This shows that the configuration involves performance-related operations that are time-expensive and can lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
