    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'dynamic_snitch_update_interval_in_ms' configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the performance and accuracy of host score calculations in the system. The configuration controls how often the more expensive part of host score calculation is performed, leading to notable performance variations at the system level. The frequency of updates determined by this configuration can significantly affect resource consumption and the timeliness of score updates, making it a critical factor in system performance."
