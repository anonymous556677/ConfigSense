    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'row_cache_size_in_mb' configuration is classified as performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly affects the memory usage of the system by setting the maximum size of the row cache in memory. The code snippet provided shows that the configuration value is used to set the capacity of the cache in bytes, which can have a significant impact on memory consumption. Additionally, setting a higher value for this configuration can potentially lead to higher performance if the cache hit rate is high. Therefore, the configuration involves performance-related operations that are memory-expensive and can lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
