    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'index_summary_capacity_in_mb' configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts system performance by setting a fixed memory pool size for SSTable index summaries. This configuration involves memory-expensive operations that can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The configuration is triggered during the initialization of the IndexSummaryManager, which occurs at application startup or when the IndexSummaryManager is instantiated. The size impact of this configuration is significant as it sets a limit on memory usage for all index summaries, affecting memory consumption and potentially causing Cassandra to use more memory than the configured limit in extreme conditions."
