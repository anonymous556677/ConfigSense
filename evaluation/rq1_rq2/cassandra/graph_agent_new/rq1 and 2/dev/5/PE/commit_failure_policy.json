    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The 'commit_failure_policy' configuration, although important for determining system behavior when commit errors occur, does not directly involve any time-expensive or memory-expensive operations within its related code. The handleCommitError method called based on this configuration may have some impact on system performance, but it does not lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Therefore, the configuration is not classified as performance-sensitive."
