    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'repair_session_space_in_mb' configuration is performance-sensitive. This is because it directly impacts the memory usage during repairs, which can lead to heap pressure or over-streaming data if not properly configured. The configuration involves time-expensive operations related to Merkle tree calculations, which are crucial for repair sessions. Any notable variation in the 'repair_session_space_in_mb' configuration can have a significant impact on the overall system performance, making it a performance-sensitive configuration."
