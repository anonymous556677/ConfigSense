{
    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'cdc_free_space_check_interval_ms' is not performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the configuration is only responsible for determining the interval at which the system checks for available space in cdc_raw when the CDCCompactor is facing challenges. This operation is not time-expensive or memory-expensive, and it does not lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Therefore, it can be considered as having a trivial performance impact and is not classified as performance-sensitive."
