    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'gc_log_threshold_in_ms' configuration option is classified as performance-sensitive. This is because setting a lower threshold for logging GC pauses can lead to increased logging overhead, which can impact system performance. From the perspective of configuration-related code, the operation of checking and logging GC pauses that exceed the specified threshold can be time-expensive and memory-expensive, especially if the frequency and duration of GC pauses are high. This can result in notable performance variations at the system level, making this configuration performance-sensitive."
