    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'snapshot_links_per_second' configuration is classified as performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly impacts system performance by throttling the creation or clearing of snapshot links to avoid negative performance impact on consumer grade SSDs. The 'getSnapshotRateLimiter' method uses the value obtained from 'getSnapshotLinksPerSecond' method, indicating that this configuration involves performance-related operations that are time-expensive and memory-expensive. The significant impact of setting a non-zero value on system performance further supports the classification of this configuration as performance-sensitive."
