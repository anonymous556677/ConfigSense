    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'internode_application_send_queue_capacity_in_bytes' is classified as performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly impacts system performance by setting limits on the size of messages that can be queued for delivery. Exceeding this capacity can lead to congestion and potential performance issues in the cluster, affecting the overall system performance. Additionally, the method 'applicationSendQueueCapacityInBytes()' retrieves the value of this configuration, indicating that it is utilized in performance-related operations within the code. Therefore, the configuration involves time-extensive operations that can lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
