    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'flush_compression' configuration is considered performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the performance of flush operations for compressed tables. The choice of compression parameters can significantly affect the time and memory consumption of flush operations, leading to notable performance variations at the system level. The developer's explanation also highlights the importance of selecting the appropriate compression option to avoid performance degradation, indicating the configuration's sensitivity to system performance."
