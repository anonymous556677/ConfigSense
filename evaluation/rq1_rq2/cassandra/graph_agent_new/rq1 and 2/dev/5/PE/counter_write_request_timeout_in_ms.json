    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'counter_write_request_timeout_in_ms' is classified as performance-sensitive. This is because the timeout duration directly impacts the performance of counter write operations at the system level. The configuration involves time-expensive operations related to waiting for completion of counter writes, which can lead to notable performance variations. Setting a lower value may result in timeouts and potential failures, while setting a higher value may increase waiting time. Therefore, any changes to this configuration can have a significant impact on system performance."
