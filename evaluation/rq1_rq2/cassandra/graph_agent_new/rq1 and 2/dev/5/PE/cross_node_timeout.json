{
    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'cross_node_timeout' configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts system performance by enabling accurate request timeout measurement and avoiding wasted processing time for already-timed-out requests. The configuration involves time-extensive operations related to cross-node communication and timeout measurement, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Therefore, it meets the criteria of being performance-sensitive based on its code context and the provided information from the developer."
