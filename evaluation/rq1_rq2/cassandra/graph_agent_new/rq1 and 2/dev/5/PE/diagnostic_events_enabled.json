    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'diagnostic_events_enabled' is performance-sensitive. This is because enabling or disabling diagnostic events directly impacts the system's performance at the system level. The configuration involves performance-related operations such as checking for enabling/disabling diagnostic events in methods like 'publish', 'isEnabled', and 'isDiagnosticsEnabled'. These operations can be time-expensive and memory-expensive, leading to notable performance variations in the system. Enabling diagnostic events may introduce overhead in terms of processing and storage, affecting the overall system performance significantly."
