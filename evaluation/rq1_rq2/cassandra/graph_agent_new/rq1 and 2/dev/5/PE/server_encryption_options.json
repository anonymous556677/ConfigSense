    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'server_encryption_options' configuration is performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly impacts system performance by enabling encryption for server-to-server communication. The setup of server keystores and truststores for mutual authentication involves time-expensive and memory-expensive operations, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Additionally, the configuration involves configuring JVM and netty defaults for SSL socket protocols and cipher suites, which can have a significant impact on performance. Therefore, the configuration is considered performance-sensitive based on its direct and substantial effect on system performance."
