    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'internode_socket_send_buffer_size_in_bytes' is performance-sensitive. The code related to this configuration involves setting the socket buffer size for internode communication, which directly impacts the performance and efficiency of internode communication in the system. This operation is time-expensive and memory-expensive as it involves setting the buffer size for communication. Any changes in this configuration can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, making it performance-sensitive."
