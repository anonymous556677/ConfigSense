    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'range_request_timeout_in_ms' configuration is considered performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly impacts the system's performance by determining how long the coordinator should wait for sequential or index scans to complete. The configuration involves time-extensive operations like fetching the timeout value in milliseconds for range and index scans, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Setting a lower value may improve response times but increase the likelihood of timeouts, while setting a higher value may reduce timeouts but increase overall response time. Therefore, the configuration has a substantial impact on system performance and is classified as performance-sensitive."
