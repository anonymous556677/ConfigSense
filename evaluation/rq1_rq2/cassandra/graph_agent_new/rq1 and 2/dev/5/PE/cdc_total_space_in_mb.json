    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'cdc_total_space_in_mb' configuration is performance-sensitive. This is because exceeding the specified total space limit for change-data-capture logs can lead to WriteTimeoutException on Mutations for tables with CDC enabled, causing disruptions in data processing and potentially affecting the overall performance of the system. Additionally, the code related to this configuration involves multiplication operations that can be time-expensive, contributing to notable performance variations at the system level."
