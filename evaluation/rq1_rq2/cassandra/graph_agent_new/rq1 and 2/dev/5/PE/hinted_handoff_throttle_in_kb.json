    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'hinted_handoff_throttle_in_kb' configuration is performance-sensitive. This is because it directly impacts the rate at which hints are delivered to nodes in the cluster, affecting the overall system performance. The configuration involves time-expensive operations related to throttling the delivery rate based on the number of nodes in the cluster, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Therefore, the configuration is considered performance-sensitive due to its significant impact on system performance."
