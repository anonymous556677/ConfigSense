    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'internode_application_receive_queue_capacity_in_bytes' is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the memory consumption and message processing efficiency of the system at the system level. The configuration sets the limit on the size of messages queued for delivery between nodes in the cluster, and adjusting this value can lead to notable performance variations. Setting the value too low may result in message loss or delays, while setting it too high may increase memory usage and degrade performance. Additionally, the configuration involves time-expensive and memory-expensive operations within its related code, which further confirms its performance sensitivity."
