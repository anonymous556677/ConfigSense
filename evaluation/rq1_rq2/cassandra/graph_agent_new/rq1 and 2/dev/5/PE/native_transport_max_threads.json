    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'native_transport_max_threads' configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the system's performance at the system level. The configuration is used to set the maximum number of threads for handling requests in the native transport, which can significantly affect the system's ability to handle requests efficiently. If this value is set too low, it can lead to performance bottlenecks and slow request handling, especially under high load. On the other hand, setting it too high may consume excessive system resources. Therefore, the configuration involves performance-related operations that are time-expensive and memory-expensive within its related code, leading to notable performance variations at the system level."
