    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'compaction_throughput_mb_per_sec' configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the speed and efficiency of compaction operations at the system level. By setting a specific throughput limit, it controls the rate at which data is compacted, which can lead to notable performance variations. In the configuration-related code, adjusting this value can result in time-expensive operations during compaction, affecting overall system performance significantly."
