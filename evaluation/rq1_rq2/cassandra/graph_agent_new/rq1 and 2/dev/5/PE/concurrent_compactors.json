    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'concurrent_compactors' configuration is performance-sensitive. This is because the number of simultaneous compactions allowed directly impacts the system's read performance in a mixed read/write workload. The configuration involves time-expensive operations related to compactions that can significantly affect system performance. Setting this value too low can lead to slower compactions and potential read performance issues, while setting it too high can consume excessive system resources. Therefore, the 'concurrent_compactors' configuration directly and substantially affects system performance at the system level, making it performance-sensitive."
