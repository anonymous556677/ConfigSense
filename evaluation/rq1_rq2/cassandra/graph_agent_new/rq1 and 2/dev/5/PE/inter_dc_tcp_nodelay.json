    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'inter_dc_tcp_nodelay' configuration is performance-sensitive. This is because enabling or disabling tcp_nodelay for inter-dc communication directly impacts network traffic, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The code snippet that checks and sets the tcpNoDelay flag, as well as retrieves values from the DatabaseDescriptor, involves time-expensive operations that can significantly affect system performance. Additionally, the triggering frequency of this configuration depends on the frequency of inter-dc communication requests, indicating its potential impact on system performance."
