    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The initial_token configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the token assignment for nodes, which can significantly affect the distribution of data across the cluster and require careful consideration for proper load balancing and performance. The code related to this configuration involves operations that are time-expensive and memory-expensive, leading to notable performance variations at the system level. Therefore, the configuration is considered performance-sensitive based on its impact on system performance and the performance-related operations within its related code."
