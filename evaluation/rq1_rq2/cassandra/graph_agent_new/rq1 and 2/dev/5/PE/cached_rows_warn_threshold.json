    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'cached_rows_warn_threshold' configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the performance of queries involving replicas by controlling the number of rows materialized on-heap. This can lead to notable performance variations at the system level depending on the threshold set. The configuration involves performance-related operations that are time-expensive, as exceeding the threshold can result in warnings being logged or queries failing. Therefore, it meets the criteria of directly and substantially affecting system performance, making it performance-sensitive."
