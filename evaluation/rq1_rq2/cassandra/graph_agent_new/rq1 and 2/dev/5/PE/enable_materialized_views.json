    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'enable_materialized_views' configuration option is classified as performance-sensitive because it directly affects the system performance at the system level. Enabling materialized views can have performance implications as they are considered experimental and not recommended for production use. The code snippet related to this configuration involves checking if materialized views are enabled and throwing an exception if they are not. This operation is time-expensive and can lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
