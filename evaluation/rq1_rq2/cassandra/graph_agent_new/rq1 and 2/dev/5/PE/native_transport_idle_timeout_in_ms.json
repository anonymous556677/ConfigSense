    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'native_transport_idle_timeout_in_ms' primarily focuses on managing resources by closing idle client connections to free up server resources. While it can indirectly impact system performance by preventing resource wastage on idle connections, it does not involve any time-extensive or memory-extensive operations within its related code that would lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Therefore, it is classified as not performance-sensitive."
