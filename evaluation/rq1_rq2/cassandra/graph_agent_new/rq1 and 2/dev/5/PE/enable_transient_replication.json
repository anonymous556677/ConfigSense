    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The 'enable_transient_replication' configuration option is not performance-sensitive. The developer's information indicates that this configuration option is related to enabling an experimental feature of transient replication, which is not recommended for production use. While the configuration is checked in the code before allowing the creation of keyspaces with transient replication, it does not involve any performance-related operations that are time-extensive or memory-extensive. Therefore, it does not lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
