    "classification_result": "Performance-insensitive with 100% confidence",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'Duration in seconds after which Cassandra should save the key cache' is performance-insensitive because it only determines the frequency at which key caches are saved, which is relatively cheap in terms of I/O for the key cache and greatly improves cold-start speeds. It does not involve any performance-related operations or affect system performance."
