    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'tombstone_failure_threshold' configuration is performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly impacts the performance and stability of the system by setting a threshold for the number of tombstones scanned during read operations. Exceeding this threshold can trigger a TombstoneOverwhelmingException, leading to degraded read performance and resource-intensive operations. The configuration involves performance-related operations that are time-expensive and memory-expensive, causing notable performance variations at the system level."
