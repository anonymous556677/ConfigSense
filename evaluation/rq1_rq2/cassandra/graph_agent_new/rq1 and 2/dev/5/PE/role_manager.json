    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'role_manager' is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the code includes functions for listing permissions, authenticating users, validating options, creating, dropping, and altering roles, granting and revoking roles, which are all time-expensive and memory-expensive operations. These operations directly impact system performance at the system level, as they are triggered frequently whenever authentication, authorization, role management, or permission checks are required in the system. The configuration option directly affects the security and access control mechanisms of the system, making it crucial for maintaining system performance."
