    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'internode_application_receive_queue_reserve_endpoint_capacity_in_bytes' is classified as performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly impacts system performance by setting limits on the amount of memory consumed by queued messages for delivery and processing. The per-endpoint limit on message queue size affects the efficiency of message processing and prevents memory exhaustion, which can have a significant impact on system performance. Additionally, the configuration involves time-expensive and memory-expensive operations within the code related to message queuing and processing, leading to notable performance variations at the system level."
