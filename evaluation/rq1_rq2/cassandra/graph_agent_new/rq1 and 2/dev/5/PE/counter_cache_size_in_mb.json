    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'counter_cache_size_in_mb' configuration is performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly impacts system performance by affecting the contention for hot counter cells and potentially skipping read operations. The code initializes the counter cache with the specified capacity, which involves memory-expensive operations. The size of the counter cache has a significant impact on system performance, as setting a higher value can improve performance but at the cost of increased memory usage. Therefore, the configuration's impact on system performance and the involvement of memory-expensive operations classify it as performance-sensitive."
