    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'index_summary_capacity_in_mb' is performance-sensitive. This is because it directly affects the memory usage of index summaries, which can have a significant impact on system performance. The configuration involves setting a fixed memory pool size for SSTable index summaries, and if the memory usage exceeds the configured limit, SSTables will shrink their index summaries to meet the limit. This operation is memory-expensive and can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, making the configuration performance-sensitive."
