    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'row_cache_size_in_mb' configuration is performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly affects the amount of memory allocated for the row cache, which can have a significant impact on system performance. The code snippet provided shows that the configuration value is used to set the capacity of the cache in bytes, indicating that it involves memory-expensive operations. Additionally, setting a larger value for this configuration can increase memory usage, potentially leading to higher performance if managed effectively. However, improper configuration can result in memory issues such as swapping to disk, which severely impacts performance at the system level."
