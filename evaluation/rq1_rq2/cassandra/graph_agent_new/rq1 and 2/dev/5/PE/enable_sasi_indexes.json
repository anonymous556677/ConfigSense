    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'enable_sasi_indexes' configuration option is performance-sensitive. Enabling SASI indexes can have a significant impact on the system's performance and resource usage, as mentioned by the developer. SASI indexes are experimental and may not be suitable for production use, consuming additional storage space and potentially impacting query performance. This directly affects the system's performance at the system level. Additionally, the triggering frequency of the configuration option indicates that it is closely tied to the creation or update of indexes, which are time-expensive operations. Therefore, the configuration involves performance-related operations that are time-extensive and can lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
