    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The 'corrupted_tombstone_strategy' configuration option does not involve any performance-related operations that are time-extensive or memory-extensive within its related code. The configuration mainly determines how tombstones are validated on reads and compaction, and the impact on system performance is related to how invalid tombstones are handled. The triggering frequency of the configuration depends on the presence of invalid tombstones in the data, but it does not directly and substantially affect system performance at the system level. Therefore, it does not lead to notable performance variations and should not be considered performance-sensitive."
