    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'phi_convict_threshold' configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the system performance by determining when a host is marked down due to failure detection. The configuration is used in the 'convict' method, which is a critical operation for maintaining system stability. Setting the threshold too low or too high can lead to significant performance variations in terms of system responsiveness and resource utilization. Therefore, any changes to this configuration can have a notable impact on the overall system performance."
