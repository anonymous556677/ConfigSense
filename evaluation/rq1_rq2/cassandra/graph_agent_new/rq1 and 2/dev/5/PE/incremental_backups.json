    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The 'incremental_backups' configuration option does not directly and substantially affect system performance at the system level. Although it may increase storage space usage, it does not involve any time-extensive or memory-extensive operations within its related code that lead to notable performance variations. The configuration mainly focuses on enabling incremental backups efficiently without duplicating data, which does not have a significant impact on system performance."
