    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'key_cache_size_in_mb' configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts system performance by affecting the key cache size in memory. The configuration involves time-expensive operations related to initializing and managing the key cache, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Setting a higher value for this configuration can improve performance by reducing seek times for key cache hits, but it can also increase memory consumption. Conversely, setting a lower value may result in performance degradation by not loading the hottest keys on startup. Therefore, the configuration's impact on system performance is substantial and directly related to performance-related operations within the code."
