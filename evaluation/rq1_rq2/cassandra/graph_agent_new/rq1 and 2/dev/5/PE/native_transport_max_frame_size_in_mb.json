    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'native_transport_max_frame_size_in_mb' is performance-sensitive. Changing this configuration directly impacts the system performance by affecting the maximum size of frames that can be transmitted over the network. This can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, as larger frame sizes can increase memory usage and processing overhead. Additionally, the code context related to this configuration involves operations that contribute to execution time and memory consumption, making it a performance-sensitive configuration."
