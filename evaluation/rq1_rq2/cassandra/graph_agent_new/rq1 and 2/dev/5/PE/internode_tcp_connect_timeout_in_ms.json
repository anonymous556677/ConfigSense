    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'internode_tcp_connect_timeout_in_ms' is classified as performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly affects the time it takes to establish internode TCP connections, which can have a significant impact on system performance. The code snippet mentioned in the developer's understanding indicates that the configuration value is crucial for determining the timeout for TCP connections. Since establishing TCP connections is a time-expensive operation, any changes in the 'internode_tcp_connect_timeout_in_ms' configuration can lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
