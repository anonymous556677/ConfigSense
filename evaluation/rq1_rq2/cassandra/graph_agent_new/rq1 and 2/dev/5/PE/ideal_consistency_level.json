    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'ideal_consistency_level' configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the system performance by adding overhead for tracking and handling the ideal consistency level for replication. This additional tracking and handling can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, especially during write operations involving replication. The configuration involves performance-related operations that are time-expensive and memory-expensive, making it a significant factor in system performance."
