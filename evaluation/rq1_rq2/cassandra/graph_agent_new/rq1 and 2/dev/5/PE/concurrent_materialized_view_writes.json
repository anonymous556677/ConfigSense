    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'concurrent_materialized_view_writes' configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the performance of the system at the system level. The configuration manages materialized views for a single ColumnFamilyStore and provides locks to prevent incoherent updates, which are time-expensive operations. The triggering frequency of the configuration depends on the number of concurrent reads or writes, indicating that it involves performance-related operations that are time-extensive. By limiting materialized view writes based on concurrent reads or writes, the configuration ensures consistency and performance, leading to notable performance variations at the system level."
