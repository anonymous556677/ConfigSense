    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'stream_throughput_outbound_megabits_per_sec' is considered performance-sensitive. This is because it directly affects the rate at which streaming file transfers occur between datacenters, leading to notable performance variations at the system level. The 'setStreamThroughputMbPerSec' method and the 'calculateRateInBytes' method, which are triggered by this configuration, involve time-expensive operations that contribute significantly to execution time and memory consumption. Therefore, any changes in the configured throughput can have a substantial impact on system performance, making this configuration performance-sensitive."
