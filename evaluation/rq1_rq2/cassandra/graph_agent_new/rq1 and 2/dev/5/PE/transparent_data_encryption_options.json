    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'transparent_data_encryption_options' configuration is performance-sensitive. This is because enabling data encryption at-rest involves time-expensive operations such as encryption and decryption processes, which can significantly impact system performance. Additionally, the encryption process may introduce overhead in terms of computational resources, leading to notable performance variations at the system level. The configuration-related code directly involves performance-related operations that are memory-expensive, as it reads from a JCE-style keystore and allows for multiple keys to be stored, which can further contribute to performance impacts."
