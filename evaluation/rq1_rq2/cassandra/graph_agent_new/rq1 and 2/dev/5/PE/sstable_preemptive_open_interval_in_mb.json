    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'sstable_preemptive_open_interval_in_mb' is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the performance of the system at the system level. The configuration is triggered during the compaction process, which is a time-expensive operation. By setting the interval for preemptive opening of SSTables, the configuration affects the smooth transfer of reads between SSTables during compaction, ultimately improving system performance. Additionally, the condition where the interval is set to Long.MAX_VALUE indicates a substantial impact on performance, making it a performance-sensitive configuration."
