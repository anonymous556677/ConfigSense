    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'allocate_tokens_for_keyspace' configuration option is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the token allocation strategy for new nodes joining the cluster, which in turn affects the distribution of data across the cluster and can impact the performance and load balancing of the system. The code snippet also involves token allocation algorithm which can be time-expensive and memory-expensive operations, leading to notable performance variations at the system level."
