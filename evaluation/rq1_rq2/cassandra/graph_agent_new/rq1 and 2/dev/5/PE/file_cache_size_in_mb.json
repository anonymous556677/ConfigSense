    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'file_cache_size_in_mb' configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts system performance by determining the memory allocated for sstable chunk cache and buffer pooling. The code snippet related to this configuration involves calculations based on the value obtained from 'DatabaseDescriptor.getFileCacheSizeInMB()', which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Additionally, the triggering frequency of this configuration is dependent on the usage of the ChunkCache class, indicating that it plays a crucial role in system performance. The size impact of this configuration is significant, as it directly affects read performance and memory consumption, making it a performance-sensitive configuration."
