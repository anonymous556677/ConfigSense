    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'windows_timer_interval' configuration is performance-sensitive. This is because adjusting the system timer interval from the default 15ms down to 1ms can have a direct and substantial impact on system performance at the system level. Lowering the timer interval can lead to tighter latency and better throughput, but it can also result in negative performance impacts in some virtualized environments. The configuration involves adjusting timer intervals, thread scheduling, and driver interrupts, which are time-expensive operations. These operations can cause notable performance variations at the system level, making the configuration performance-sensitive."
