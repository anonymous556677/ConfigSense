    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'repaired_data_tracking_for_range_reads_enabled' is classified as performance-sensitive. This is because enabling the configuration adds overhead to range read operations, especially when there are multiple full replicas to compare results from. This overhead can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, affecting execution time and memory consumption. The configuration directly and substantially affects system performance by introducing time-expensive and memory-expensive operations within its related code, making it performance-sensitive."
