{
    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'enable_drop_compact_storage' is classified as performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly impacts the storage format of tables in the system, potentially affecting performance and storage efficiency. The code context related to this configuration involves checking the return value of 'DatabaseDescriptor.enableDropCompactStorage()' method, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level depending on the table type and the flags that are set. Therefore, the configuration involves performance-related operations that are time-expensive and memory-expensive, making it performance-sensitive."
