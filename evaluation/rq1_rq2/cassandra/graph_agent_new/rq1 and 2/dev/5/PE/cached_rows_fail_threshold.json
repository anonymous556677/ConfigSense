    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The 'cached_rows_fail_threshold' configuration option is not performance-sensitive. The developer's explanation indicates that this configuration is used to set a fail threshold for cached replica rows, which does not involve any time-extensive or memory-extensive operations within its related code. Additionally, the triggering frequency and size impact of this configuration do not suggest any notable performance variations at the system level. Therefore, it can be classified as not performance-sensitive."
