    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'streaming_keep_alive_period_in_secs' is performance-sensitive. This is because the setting directly impacts the frequency of keep-alive messages being sent, which can have a significant effect on network traffic and the stability of streaming sessions. From a system level perspective, the configuration involves time-expensive operations related to sending keep-alive messages periodically, which can lead to notable performance variations in terms of network traffic and session reliability."
