{
    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'internode_tcp_user_timeout_in_ms' is classified as performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly impacts the time it takes for internode TCP connections to establish in Cassandra, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The code snippet provided shows that the 'tcpUserTimeoutInMS' method is used to retrieve the configured value, indicating that this configuration involves time-expensive operations related to connection establishment. Additionally, the triggering frequency of this configuration is tied to the creation of new internode TCP connections, further emphasizing its performance sensitivity. Overall, the configuration's direct impact on system performance and involvement of time-extensive operations make it performance-sensitive."
