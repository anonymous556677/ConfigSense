    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'column_index_cache_size_in_kb' is performance-sensitive. This is because the size limit specified directly impacts the memory usage and performance of reading index entries from disk at the system level. The configuration involves time-expensive operations related to managing the size of sstable indexed key cache entries, which can lead to notable performance variations. Therefore, any changes to this configuration can have a significant impact on the overall system performance."
