    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'internode_application_send_queue_reserve_global_capacity_in_bytes' is performance-sensitive. This is because it directly impacts the overall performance and resource utilization of the system by setting limits on the number of messages that can be queued for delivery. Exceeding these limits can lead to message drops, delays in delivery, and potential resource exhaustion, all of which have a significant impact on system performance. Additionally, the configuration involves time-expensive operations related to message queuing and processing, which further contribute to its performance sensitivity."
