    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'internode_application_receive_queue_reserve_global_capacity_in_bytes' is classified as performance-sensitive. This is because it directly impacts the system performance at the system level by setting the global limit on the size of messages queued for delivery between nodes in the cluster. The configuration involves performance-related operations that are memory-extensive, as it determines the maximum size of messages that can be queued for delivery or processing. Setting this value incorrectly can lead to message loss, delays, excessive memory consumption, and potential performance issues, making it a critical configuration for system performance."
