    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'num_tokens' configuration is classified as performance-sensitive because it directly and substantially affects system performance at the system level. The configuration involves setting the number of tokens randomly assigned to the node on the ring, which impacts data distribution and load balancing across the nodes in the cluster. This can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, making it crucial for optimal performance and resource utilization. Additionally, the configuration involves time-expensive operations related to data distribution and memory-expensive operations related to load balancing, which further justifies its classification as performance-sensitive."
