    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'native_transport_flush_in_batches_legacy' configuration is classified as performance-sensitive. This is because enabling this configuration directly impacts system performance by improving throughput through TCP message coalescing. The use of 'useNativeTransportLegacyFlusher()' method in the 'PipelineConfigurator' class indicates that this configuration involves performance-related operations that are time-expensive and memory-expensive. By batching multiple messages into a single TCP packet, it reduces the number of TCP packets sent over the network, leading to notable performance variations at the system level. The triggering frequency of this configuration depends on workload and client connections, further emphasizing its performance sensitivity."
