    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'tracetype_query_ttl' is classified as performance-sensitive. This is because setting a higher TTL value for trace types can lead to increased storage usage and potentially impact the performance of the system. The code related to this configuration involves managing and storing trace information for longer periods, which can contribute to time-expensive and memory-expensive operations. These operations directly affect system performance at the system level, leading to notable performance variations."
