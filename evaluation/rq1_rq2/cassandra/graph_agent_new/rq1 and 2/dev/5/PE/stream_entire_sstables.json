    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'stream_entire_sstables' configuration is classified as performance-sensitive. This is because enabling this configuration directly impacts system performance at the system level by significantly speeding up network transfer and reducing GC pressure on nodes. The code context in the computeShouldStreamEntireSSTables() method involves operations that are time-expensive (streaming entire SSTables) and memory-expensive (zero-copy streaming), leading to notable performance variations. Additionally, the configuration is automatically disabled if internode encryption is enabled, indicating its sensitivity to system performance."
