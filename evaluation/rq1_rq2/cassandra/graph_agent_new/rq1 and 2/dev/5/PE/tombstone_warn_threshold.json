    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'tombstone_warn_threshold' is considered performance-sensitive because adjusting this threshold directly impacts the system's performance and memory usage. The 'getTombstoneWarnThreshold' method is called whenever the system needs to retrieve the threshold value, indicating that it is a critical parameter for system operations. Changing the threshold can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, as it affects heap memory consumption and potential performance issues. Therefore, the configuration involves performance-related operations that are time-expensive and memory-expensive, making it performance-sensitive."
