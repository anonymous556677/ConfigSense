    "classification_result": "Performance-insensitive with 100% confidence",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'Duration in seconds after which Cassandra should save the row cache' is performance-insensitive because it only determines when the row cache should be saved, which does not directly impact system performance. It is related to the management of cache saving and does not involve performance-related operations or affect system performance."
