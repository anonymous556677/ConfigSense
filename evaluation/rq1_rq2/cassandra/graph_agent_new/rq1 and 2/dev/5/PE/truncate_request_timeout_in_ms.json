    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'truncate_request_timeout_in_ms' configuration is performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly impacts the timeout for truncating operations, which are time-expensive operations. Setting a lower value may lead to premature timeouts and potential system inconsistencies, while setting a higher value may result in longer wait times for truncates to complete, affecting the overall system performance. Therefore, the configuration involves performance-related operations that have a notable impact on system performance at the system level."
