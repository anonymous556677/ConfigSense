    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'disk_failure_policy' configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts system performance at the system level. The different policies like 'die', 'stop_paranoid', 'stop', 'best_effort', and 'ignore' can lead to significant performance variations by affecting the system's availability, data integrity, and overall stability. Depending on the chosen policy, it can trigger time-expensive and memory-expensive operations such as stopping transports, marking disks as unwritable, killing the JVM, and potentially making the node effectively dead. These operations have a notable performance impact on the system, making the 'disk_failure_policy' configuration performance-sensitive."
