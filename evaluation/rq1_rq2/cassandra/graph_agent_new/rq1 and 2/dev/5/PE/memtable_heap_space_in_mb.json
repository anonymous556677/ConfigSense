    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'memtable_heap_space_in_mb' configuration is performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly impacts the memory allocation for memtables in the Cassandra database, which can have a significant effect on system performance. The code snippet provided shows that the value of 'memtable_heap_space_in_mb' is used to calculate heapLimit and offHeapLimit for the memtable allocator pool, indicating that it involves memory-expensive operations. Additionally, the triggering frequency of the configuration depends on the memtable size exceeding a threshold, which can lead to flush operations and potential downtime or performance degradation if the memory limit is set too low. Therefore, the configuration's impact on memory allocation and system performance qualifies it as performance-sensitive."
