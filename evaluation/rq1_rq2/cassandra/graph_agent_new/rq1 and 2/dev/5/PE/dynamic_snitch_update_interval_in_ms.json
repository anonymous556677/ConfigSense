    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'dynamic_snitch_update_interval_in_ms' configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the system performance by determining how often the more expensive part of host score calculation is performed. This configuration involves time-expensive operations related to updating host scores, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The frequency of updates controlled by this configuration can significantly affect system overhead and responsiveness, making it a critical factor in system performance."
