    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'internode_streaming_tcp_user_timeout_in_ms' is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the processing time of incoming stream messages on streaming connections. The code snippet that checks and uses this configuration value to determine the timeout for processing messages indicates that it involves time-expensive operations. Setting this configuration too low may result in premature closure of connections, while setting it too high may lead to increased latency in message processing. Therefore, the configuration directly and substantially affects system performance at the system level by causing notable performance variations."
