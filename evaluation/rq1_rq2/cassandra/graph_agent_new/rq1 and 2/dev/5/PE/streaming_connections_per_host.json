    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'streaming_connections_per_host' is performance-sensitive. This is because limiting the number of connections per host for streaming directly impacts the performance of streaming operations at the system level. The code context shows that this configuration is used to control the behavior of streaming operations, which are time-expensive and memory-expensive operations. By restricting the number of connections per host, it can significantly affect the overall performance of streaming operations, leading to notable performance variations in the system. Therefore, the configuration is considered performance-sensitive based on its direct and substantial impact on system performance."
