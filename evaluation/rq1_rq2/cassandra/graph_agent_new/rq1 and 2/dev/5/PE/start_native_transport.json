    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'start_native_transport' configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly affects system performance by starting or not starting the native transport server. This operation involves time-expensive and memory-expensive tasks that can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The configuration code checks the system property and invokes methods that impact system resources and communication efficiency, making it a critical factor in system performance."
