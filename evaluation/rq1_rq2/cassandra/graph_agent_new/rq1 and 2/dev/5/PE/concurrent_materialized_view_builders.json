    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'concurrent_materialized_view_builders' configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the system's performance by controlling the number of simultaneous materialized view builder tasks. This configuration involves performance-related operations that are time-expensive, as it determines how many tasks can run concurrently, affecting the overall execution time and resource utilization of the system. Therefore, changes in this configuration can lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
