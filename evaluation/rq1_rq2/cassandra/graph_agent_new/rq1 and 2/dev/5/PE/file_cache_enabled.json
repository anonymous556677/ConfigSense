    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'file_cache_enabled' configuration option is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts system performance by affecting memory usage. Enabling this configuration option will store sstable chunks in-memory as uncompressed buffers, leading to increased memory consumption. This can improve read performance for frequently accessed data but will consume memory resources, which can have a notable impact on system performance. Additionally, the code snippet related to checking the configuration value and cache size to determine cache creation indicates that this configuration involves time-expensive operations that contribute to performance variations at the system level."
