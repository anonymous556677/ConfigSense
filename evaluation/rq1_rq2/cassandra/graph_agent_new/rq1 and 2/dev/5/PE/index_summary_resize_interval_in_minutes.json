    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'index_summary_resize_interval_in_minutes' is performance-sensitive. This is because the frequency of resampling index summaries directly impacts memory allocation and system performance. Setting a lower interval leads to more frequent resampling and memory redistribution, which can significantly affect system performance by consuming more resources. Conversely, setting a higher interval may result in suboptimal memory allocation, also impacting system performance. Therefore, the configuration involves performance-related operations that are memory-expensive and time-expensive, leading to notable performance variations at the system level."
