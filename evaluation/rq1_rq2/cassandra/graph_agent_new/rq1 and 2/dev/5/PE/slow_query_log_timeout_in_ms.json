    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'slow_query_log_timeout_in_ms' configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the system's performance monitoring and troubleshooting capabilities. By setting a timeout value, the system logs slow queries, which can have a notable impact on system performance. Additionally, the configuration involves performance-related operations such as monitoring query execution time, which are time-expensive and contribute to significant performance variations at the system level."
