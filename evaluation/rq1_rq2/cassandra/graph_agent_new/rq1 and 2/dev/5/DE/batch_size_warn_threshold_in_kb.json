    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The configuration 'batch_size_warn_threshold_in_kb' is used to set a threshold for the batch size in kilobytes at which a warning log will be triggered. The value is retrieved using the method getBatchSizeWarnThreshold() which internally calls DatabaseDescriptor.getBatchSizeWarnThresholdInKB().",

It is important to carefully consider the impact on system stability before changing this configuration."
