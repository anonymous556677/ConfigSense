So a small total commitlog space will tend to cause more flush activity on less-active columnfamilies.  The default value is the smaller of 8192, and 1/4 of the total space of the commitlog volume. ",

A smaller total commit log space will result in more frequent flush activities, potentially impacting the performance of the system."
