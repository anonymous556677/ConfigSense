    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The 'periodic_commitlog_sync_lag_block_in_ms' configuration is used in the PeriodicCommitLogService class to determine the amount of time to block writes while waiting for a slow disk flush to complete. It calculates the expected sync time based on the current system time and the configured block time in milliseconds.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The triggering frequency of the 'periodic_commitlog_sync_lag_block_in_ms' configuration depends on the frequency of disk flushes and the speed of the disk. If the disk flushes are slow and cannot keep up with the write operations, this configuration will be triggered more frequently.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the 'periodic_commitlog_sync_lag_block_in_ms' configuration on the system is that it can potentially slow down the write operations if the configured block time is too long. This can lead to increased latency in write operations and potentially impact the overall performance of the system."
