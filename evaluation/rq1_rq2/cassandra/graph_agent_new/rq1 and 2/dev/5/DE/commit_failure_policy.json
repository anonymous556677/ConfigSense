    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The 'commit_failure_policy' configuration determines the action to be taken when a commit error occurs. The code snippet provided shows that the handleCommitError method is called when a commit error is encountered. It inspects the commit log error and based on the 'commit_failure_policy' configuration, takes appropriate action such as stopping transports, logging error messages, or ignoring the error.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The triggering frequency of the 'commit_failure_policy' configuration depends on how often commit errors occur in the system. If commit errors are frequent, the configuration will be triggered more often.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the 'commit_failure_policy' configuration on the system is significant as it determines the behavior of the node when commit errors occur. Depending on the policy set (die, stop, stop_commit, ignore), the node may shut down, continue to service reads, or ignore the errors. This can affect the availability and reliability of the system."
