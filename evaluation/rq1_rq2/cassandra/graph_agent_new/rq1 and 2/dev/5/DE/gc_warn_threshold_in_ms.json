    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The configuration 'gc_warn_threshold_in_ms' is used to set a threshold for GC pauses. If the GC pause is greater than the specified threshold, it will be logged at WARN level. This allows developers to monitor and adjust the threshold based on the application's throughput requirement.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The triggering frequency of the 'gc_warn_threshold_in_ms' configuration depends on the frequency of GC pauses in the system. If the GC pauses exceed the threshold, the configuration will be triggered and the pause will be logged at WARN level.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the 'gc_warn_threshold_in_ms' configuration option on the system is that it helps in monitoring and identifying GC pauses that exceed the specified threshold. This can provide insights into the performance of the application and help in optimizing the GC process to reduce pauses and improve overall system performance."
