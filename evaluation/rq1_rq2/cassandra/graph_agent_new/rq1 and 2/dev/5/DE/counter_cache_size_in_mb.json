    "config_description": "Maximum size of the counter cache in memory.  Counter cache helps to reduce counter locks' contention for hot counter cells. In case of RF = 1 a counter cache hit will cause Cassandra to skip the read before write entirely. With RF > 1 a counter cache hit will still help to reduce the duration of the lock hold, helping with hot counter cell updates, but will not allow skipping the read entirely. Only the local (clock, count) tuple of a counter cell is kept in memory, not the whole counter, so it's relatively cheap.  NOTE: if you reduce the size, you may not get you hottest keys loaded on startup.  Default value is empty to make it \"auto\" (min(2.5% of Heap (in MB), 50MB)). Set to 0 to disable counter cache. NOTE: if you perform counter deletes and rely on low gcgs, you should disable the counter cache.",
    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The 'counter_cache_size_in_mb' configuration is used to set the maximum size of the counter cache in memory. It helps to reduce counter locks' contention for hot counter cells. The code initializes the counter cache with the specified capacity in MBs and schedules saving based on the configured parameters.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The configuration is triggered whenever the counter cache needs to be initialized or saved based on the configured period and keys to save. The triggering frequency is determined by the values set for 'counterCacheSavePeriod' and 'counterCacheKeysToSave'.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the 'counter_cache_size_in_mb' configuration option on the system is significant. Setting a higher value can improve performance by reducing contention for hot counter cells and potentially skipping read operations. However, setting a lower value may result in not loading the hottest keys on startup. It's important to consider the trade-offs between memory usage and performance when configuring this option."
