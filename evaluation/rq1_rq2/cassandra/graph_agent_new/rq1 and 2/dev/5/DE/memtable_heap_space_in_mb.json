    "config_description": "Total permitted memory to use for memtables. Cassandra will stop accepting writes when the limit is exceeded until a flush completes, and will trigger a flush based on memtable_cleanup_threshold If omitted, Cassandra will set both to 1/4 the size of the heap.",
    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The configuration 'memtable_heap_space_in_mb' is used to set the total permitted memory to use for memtables in the Cassandra database. The code snippet provided shows that the value of 'memtable_heap_space_in_mb' is used to calculate the heapLimit and offHeapLimit for the memtable allocator pool.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The triggering frequency of the 'memtable_heap_space_in_mb' configuration in the system depends on the memtable_cleanup_threshold value set in the configuration. When the memtable size exceeds the cleanup threshold, a flush operation is triggered to clear the memtable and make space for new writes.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the 'memtable_heap_space_in_mb' configuration option on the system is significant. If the configured memory limit is too low, Cassandra may stop accepting writes until a flush completes, leading to potential downtime or performance degradation. On the other hand, setting a high memory limit can consume more system resources, potentially affecting the overall system performance."
