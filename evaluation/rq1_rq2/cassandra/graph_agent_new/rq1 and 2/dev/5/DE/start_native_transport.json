If the property is set to true or if it is not set and the DatabaseDescriptor.startNativeTransport() method returns true, then the native transport server is started along with setting the RpcReady flag in the StorageService instance. Otherwise, a message is logged indicating that the native transport is not started.",

Starting the native transport server allows clients to connect to the Cassandra cluster using the native protocol, enabling faster and more efficient communication. However, starting the native transport server also consumes system resources and may introduce security risks if not properly configured."
