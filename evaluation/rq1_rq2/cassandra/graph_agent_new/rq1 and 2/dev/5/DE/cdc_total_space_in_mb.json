    "config_description": "Total space to use for change-data-capture logs on disk.  If space gets above this value, Cassandra will throw WriteTimeoutException on Mutations including tables with CDC enabled. A CDCCompactor is responsible for parsing the raw CDC logs and deleting them when parsing is completed.  The default value is the min of 4096 mb and 1/8th of the total space of the drive where cdc_raw_directory resides.",
    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The configuration code 'cdc_total_space_in_mb' is used to determine the total space available for change-data-capture logs on disk. It multiplies the value of 'CDCSpaceInMB' obtained from DatabaseDescriptor by 1024*1024 to convert it to bytes.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The triggering frequency of the 'cdc_total_space_in_mb' configuration depends on the usage of change-data-capture logs and the rate at which the space allocated for these logs is being filled. It is triggered when the space used for CDC logs exceeds the specified total space limit.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the 'cdc_total_space_in_mb' configuration option on the system is significant. If the space allocated for CDC logs exceeds the specified limit, Cassandra will throw WriteTimeoutException on Mutations for tables with CDC enabled. This can lead to disruptions in data processing and potentially affect the overall performance of the system."
