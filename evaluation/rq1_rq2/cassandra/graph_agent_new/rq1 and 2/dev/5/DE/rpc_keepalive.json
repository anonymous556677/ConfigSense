    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The triggering frequency of the rpc_keepalive configuration in the system depends on when the Server object is instantiated with the Builder object that contains the configuration value. It is triggered during the initialization of the Server object.",

However, it may also increase resource usage due to maintaining idle connections."
