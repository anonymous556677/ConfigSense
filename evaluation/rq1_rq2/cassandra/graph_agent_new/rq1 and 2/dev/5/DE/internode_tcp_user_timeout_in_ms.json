The amount of time to wait for internode tcp connections to establish. internode_tcp_connect_timeout_in_ms: 2000  The amount of time unacknowledged data is allowed on a connection before we throw out the connection Note this is only supported on Linux + epoll, and it appears to behave oddly above a setting of 30000 (it takes much longer than 30s) as of Linux 4.12. If you want something that high set this to 0 which picks up the OS default and configure the net.ipv4.tcp_retries2 sysctl to be ~8.",
    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The configuration 'internode_tcp_user_timeout_in_ms' is used to determine the amount of time to wait for internode TCP connections to establish in Cassandra. The code snippet provided shows that the 'tcpUserTimeoutInMS' method is used to return the configured value if it is set, otherwise it retrieves the value based on the connection category (messaging or streaming) from the 'DatabaseDescriptor' class.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The triggering frequency of the 'internode_tcp_user_timeout_in_ms' configuration in the system depends on how often new internode TCP connections are established in Cassandra. The configuration is triggered whenever a new connection is created for messaging or streaming purposes.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the 'internode_tcp_user_timeout_in_ms' configuration option on the system is related to the time it takes for internode TCP connections to establish. Setting this value too low may result in connections timing out prematurely, while setting it too high may lead to longer connection establishment times. It is recommended to set this value based on the network conditions and requirements of the Cassandra cluster."
