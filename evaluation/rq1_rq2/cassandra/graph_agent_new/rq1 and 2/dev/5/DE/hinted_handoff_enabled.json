    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The configuration 'hinted_handoff_enabled' is used to determine if hinted handoff is enabled globally in the system. The method getHintedHandoffEnabled() returns the value of DatabaseDescriptor.hintedHandoffEnabled() which indicates if hinted handoff is enabled.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The configuration is triggered whenever the shouldHint() method is called, which is typically when a replica is being checked for hinting. The frequency of triggering depends on the number of replicas being checked for hinting in the system.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "Enabling or disabling hinted handoff through the 'hinted_handoff_enabled' configuration can impact the system's performance and reliability. If hinted handoff is disabled, the system may not be able to efficiently handle failures or downtime of replicas, potentially leading to data loss or inconsistency. On the other hand, enabling hinted handoff can increase the system's resilience by ensuring data is still available even when replicas are temporarily unavailable."
