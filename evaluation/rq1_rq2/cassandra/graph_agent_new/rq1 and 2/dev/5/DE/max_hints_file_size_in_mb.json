    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The configuration 'max_hints_file_size_in_mb' is used to set the maximum size for a single hints file in megabytes. In the provided code snippet, the value of 'maxHintsFileSize' is retrieved using 'DatabaseDescriptor.getMaxHintsFileSize()' and is used to determine when to break the loop while writing hints to a file.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The triggering frequency of the 'max_hints_file_size_in_mb' configuration in the system depends on how often the 'flushInternal' method is called with a large amount of data to be written to hints files. If the data being written exceeds the configured maximum size, the loop will break and a new hints file will be created.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the 'max_hints_file_size_in_mb' configuration option on the system is that it helps in controlling the size of individual hints files. Setting a smaller value for this configuration can result in more frequent creation of hints files, while a larger value can allow for larger hints files to be created before a new file is generated."
