    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'client_encryption_options' is performance-sensitive. This is because enabling encryption for client-to-server communication involves SSL/TLS encryption and decryption processes, which are time-expensive operations. These operations directly impact system performance at the system level by adding computational overhead. The configuration code handles the creation of SSL contexts and setting up SSL/TLS connections, which are critical for secure communication but also contribute to notable performance variations due to the encryption processes."
