    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'internode_socket_send_buffer_size_in_bytes' is performance-sensitive. This is because setting the socket buffer size for internode communication can directly impact the performance and efficiency of internode communication, affecting the throughput and latency of data transfer between nodes in the system. The code related to this configuration involves checking and setting the socketSendBufferSizeInBytes, which are time-extensive operations that can lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
