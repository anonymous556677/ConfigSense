    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'key_cache_keys_to_save' configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts system performance by determining the number of keys that need to be saved from the key cache. This configuration involves performance-related operations that are time-expensive, as saving a large number of keys can increase memory consumption and potentially lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The developer's understanding also highlights the significant impact of this configuration on system performance, further supporting its classification as performance-sensitive."
