    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The 'cached_rows_fail_threshold' configuration is not performance-sensitive based on the provided information. The configuration is used to set a threshold for the number of cached replica rows that can fail before triggering a specific action, which is more related to data consistency and accuracy rather than directly impacting system performance at a significant level. The triggering frequency and size impact of the configuration also suggest that it is not time-expensive or memory-expensive, and therefore does not lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
