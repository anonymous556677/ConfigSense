    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'disk_failure_policy' configuration is considered performance-sensitive because it directly impacts system performance at the system level. The configuration determines the behavior of the system when encountering disk failures or errors, which can lead to significant performance variations. Depending on the chosen policy, the system may stop transports, mark disks as unwritable, or even kill the JVM in case of critical errors. These operations are time-expensive and memory-expensive, contributing to notable performance variations. Therefore, the 'disk_failure_policy' configuration involves performance-related operations that have a substantial impact on system performance, making it performance-sensitive."
