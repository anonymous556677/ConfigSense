    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'streaming_connections_per_host' configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the number of connections per host for streaming, which can have a significant effect on system performance. The configuration is retrieved using DatabaseDescriptor.getStreamingConnectionsPerHost() method and passed as a parameter to the RangeStreamer object, indicating that it plays a crucial role in the streaming process. Additionally, increasing this configuration can potentially improve performance in CPU-bound scenarios, but excessive values can lead to resource contention and performance degradation, highlighting its sensitivity to system performance."
