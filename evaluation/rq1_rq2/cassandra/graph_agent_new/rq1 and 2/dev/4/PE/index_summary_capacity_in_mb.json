    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'index_summary_capacity_in_mb' configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the memory usage of all index summaries, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The configuration involves setting a fixed memory pool size for SSTable index summaries, which can affect the memory consumption of the system. Additionally, the configuration is triggered during the initialization of the IndexSummaryManager class, indicating that it plays a crucial role in managing memory resources. Therefore, any changes or limitations imposed by this configuration can have a significant impact on system performance."
