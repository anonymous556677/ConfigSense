    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'concurrent_materialized_view_builders' configuration is performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly impacts the system's performance and resource utilization by controlling the number of simultaneous materialized view builder tasks allowed. Setting a higher value can increase parallelism and potentially improve performance, but also consume more resources. Conversely, setting a lower value may reduce resource consumption but could lead to slower materialized view building process. The configuration involves performance-related operations that are time-expensive and memory-expensive within the CompactionManager class, leading to notable performance variations at the system level."
