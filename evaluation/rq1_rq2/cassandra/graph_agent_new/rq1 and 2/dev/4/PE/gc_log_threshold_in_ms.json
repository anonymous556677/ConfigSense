    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'gc_log_threshold_in_ms' configuration is considered performance-sensitive because it directly impacts system performance by controlling the amount of logging related to GC pauses. Setting a lower threshold value can result in more frequent logging, leading to increased logging overhead and potentially affecting system performance. This configuration involves performance-related operations (logging) that can be time-expensive, especially when triggered frequently due to GC pauses exceeding the threshold. Therefore, the 'gc_log_threshold_in_ms' configuration can cause notable performance variations at the system level."
