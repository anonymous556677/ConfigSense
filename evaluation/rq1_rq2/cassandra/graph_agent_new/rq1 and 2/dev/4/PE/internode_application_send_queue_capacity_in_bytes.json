    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'internode_application_send_queue_capacity_in_bytes' is classified as performance-sensitive. This is because the capacity limit set by this configuration directly impacts the system's performance and scalability at the system level. The code related to this configuration involves managing message queues for delivery between nodes, which are time-expensive operations. Setting appropriate values for this configuration is crucial for preventing overload, ensuring efficient message delivery, and maintaining system stability. Therefore, any changes to this configuration can lead to notable performance variations in the system."
