    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The transparent_data_encryption_options configuration is classified as performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration involves encryption and decryption operations on disk, which are time-expensive operations that can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The developer's information also mentions that the configuration can impact system performance slightly due to the overhead of encryption and decryption operations. Therefore, the configuration directly and substantially affects system performance, making it performance-sensitive."
