{
    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'stream_entire_sstables' is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts system performance by enabling zero-copy streaming of entire SSTables between nodes, which can significantly speed up network transfer and reduce GC pressure. This involves time-extensive operations that can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Additionally, the code context in computeShouldStreamEntireSSTables() involves performance-related operations that contribute positively to execution time and memory consumption, further supporting the classification as performance-sensitive."
