    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'cas_contention_timeout_in_ms' configuration option is performance-sensitive. This is because it directly impacts the system's performance and latency by determining how long a coordinator should continue to retry a CAS operation that contends with other proposals for the same row. The configuration involves time-extensive operations related to retrying Paxos rounds until the timeout is reached, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The triggering frequency and impact on system performance and latency further emphasize the performance sensitivity of this configuration."
