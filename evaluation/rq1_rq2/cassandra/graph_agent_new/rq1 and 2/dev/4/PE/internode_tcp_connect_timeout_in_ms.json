    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'internode_tcp_connect_timeout_in_ms' is classified as performance-sensitive. This is because the timeout value directly impacts the performance of internode TCP connections in the Cassandra system, which are crucial for communication between nodes in the cluster. The code snippet provided shows that the configuration value is checked and retrieved, indicating that it plays a significant role in the system. Additionally, setting a higher or lower timeout value can have notable performance variations at the system level, affecting the stability and responsiveness of the system."
