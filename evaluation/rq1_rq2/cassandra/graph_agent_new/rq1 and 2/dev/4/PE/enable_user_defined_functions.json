    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'enable_user_defined_functions' is not performance-sensitive. The developer's information indicates that this configuration is checked in the assertUdfsEnabled method to ensure that user-defined functions are enabled in cassandra.yaml. Enabling user-defined functions may introduce security risks, as mentioned in the InvalidRequestException message, but there is no indication that this configuration directly and substantially affects system performance at the system level. Additionally, the triggering frequency of this configuration is only when the assertUdfsEnabled method is called, which suggests that it does not involve time-extensive or memory-extensive operations that lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
