    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'windows_timer_interval' is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts system performance by adjusting the system timer on Windows from the default 15ms down to the minimum of 1ms. This adjustment affects timer intervals, thread scheduling, driver interrupts, etc., which are critical system-level operations. Lowering the Windows timer interval can provide much tighter latency and better throughput, but changing this setting below the system default in some virtualized environments may result in a negative performance impact. Therefore, the configuration involves time-extensive operations that lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
