    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The initial_token configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly affects the token assignment for nodes in the cluster, impacting the distribution of data and the performance of the system. The code logic related to initial tokens involves time-expensive operations such as token allocation and random token generation, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Therefore, the configuration is considered performance-sensitive based on its impact on system performance and the time-expensive operations within the configuration-related code."
