    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'commit_failure_policy' configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts system performance at the system level. The different policies associated with this configuration can lead to significant performance variations, such as shutting down the system or stopping certain operations, depending on the chosen policy. Additionally, the code related to this configuration likely contains performance-related operations that are time-expensive, such as handling commit errors, which can further contribute to notable performance variations."
