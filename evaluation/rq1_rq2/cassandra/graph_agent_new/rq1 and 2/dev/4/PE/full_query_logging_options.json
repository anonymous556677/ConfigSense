    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'full_query_logging_options' configuration is classified as performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly impacts the behavior of the full query logging feature, which can affect the log size, archive settings, and other parameters related to full query logging. These changes can have a significant impact on system performance and resource usage. Additionally, the configuration code retrieves options from binLogOptions when logging is enabled, which can involve time-expensive operations. Therefore, the configuration is considered performance-sensitive as it can lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
