    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'internode_application_receive_queue_capacity_in_bytes' is classified as performance-sensitive. This is because the capacity setting directly impacts the memory consumption and message processing efficiency of the system. The configuration involves memory-expensive operations related to queuing and dequeuing messages in the internode communication process. If the capacity is set too low, it can lead to dropped messages or slow processing, while setting it too high can result in increased memory usage and potential performance issues. Therefore, the configuration has a direct and substantial effect on system performance at the system level, making it performance-sensitive."
