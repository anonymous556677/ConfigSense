    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'file_cache_enabled' configuration option is performance-sensitive. This is because enabling or disabling the chunk cache directly impacts system performance by affecting read performance through reducing disk I/O operations. The configuration involves memory-expensive operations by storing uncompressed buffers in-memory, which can lead to increased memory usage and potential memory pressure. The code snippet related to this configuration checks for specific conditions in the 'DatabaseDescriptor' class and determines whether the chunk cache should be enabled or not, indicating a direct link between the configuration and system performance."
