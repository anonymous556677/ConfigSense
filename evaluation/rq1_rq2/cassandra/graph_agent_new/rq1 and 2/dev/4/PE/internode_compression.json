    "classification_result": "Performance-insensitive with 100% confidence",
    "Reason": "The internode_compression configuration option, which controls whether traffic between nodes is compressed, is performance-insensitive because it does not directly impact system performance. The choice of compression level does not affect the overall system performance or any time-dependent aspects of system operation."
