    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'internode_tcp_user_timeout_in_ms' is performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly impacts the time allowed for internode TCP connections to establish, which is crucial for efficient communication within the Cassandra cluster. The code snippet related to the configuration involves time-extensive operations to determine the timeout value based on the connection category, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, especially in scenarios where the network conditions are less than optimal."
