    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'internode_application_send_queue_reserve_endpoint_capacity_in_bytes' is performance-sensitive. This is because it directly impacts the amount of memory allocated for message queues, which can significantly affect the overall performance of message processing and delivery in the system. The configuration involves setting limits on the size of messages queued for delivery to other nodes, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Additionally, the developer's explanation indicates that the configuration is triggered when certain conditions are met, showing its importance in the system's performance."
