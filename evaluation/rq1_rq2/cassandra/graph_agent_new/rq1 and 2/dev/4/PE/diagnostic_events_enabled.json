    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'diagnostic_events_enabled' configuration is classified as performance-sensitive. This is because enabling this configuration can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The configuration involves checking in multiple methods like 'publish' and 'isEnabled', which are time-expensive operations. Additionally, enabling diagnostic events can add overhead for capturing and processing events, potentially impacting system performance and resource utilization. Therefore, the configuration directly and substantially affects system performance, making it performance-sensitive."
