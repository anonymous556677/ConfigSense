    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'column_index_cache_size_in_kb' is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the memory usage and performance of the system. Setting the size limit too low can result in more disk reads and slower performance, while setting it too high can lead to increased memory usage. This configuration involves memory-expensive operations related to sstable indexed key cache entries, which can cause notable performance variations at the system level."
