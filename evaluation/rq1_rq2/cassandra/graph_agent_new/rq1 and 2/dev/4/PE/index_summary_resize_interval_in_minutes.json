    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'index_summary_resize_interval_in_minutes' is performance-sensitive. This is because it directly impacts the memory distribution in the system, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The resampling process triggered by this configuration involves time-expensive and memory-expensive operations that can significantly affect system performance. Setting a lower interval may increase the frequency of resampling, impacting system performance, while setting a higher interval may lead to inefficient memory usage. Therefore, the configuration has a direct and substantial effect on system performance, making it performance-sensitive."
