    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The native_transport_max_threads configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly affects the system's ability to handle concurrent requests. The configuration is used to determine the maximum number of threads for processing requests, and setting it too low may lead to bottlenecks and slow request processing. Conversely, setting it too high may consume excessive system resources. This configuration directly impacts the system's performance at the system level by influencing the concurrency of request handling, making it a performance-sensitive configuration."
