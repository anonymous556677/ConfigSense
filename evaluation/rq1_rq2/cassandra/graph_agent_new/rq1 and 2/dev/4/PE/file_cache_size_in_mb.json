    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'file_cache_size_in_mb' configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the system's memory allocation for sstable chunk cache and buffer pooling, which are critical for handling uncompressed sstable chunks and pooling buffers. The configuration involves time-extensive and memory-extensive operations within the code related to initializing the ChunkCache class and creating an instance of the ChunkCache based on the calculated cache size. The allocation of memory resources based on this configuration significantly affects the system's performance at the system level by influencing memory usage and efficiency in managing cache and buffer resources."
