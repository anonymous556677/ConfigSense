    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'inter_dc_stream_throughput_outbound_megabits_per_sec' is classified as performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly affects the rate at which data is transferred between datacenters, leading to notable performance variations at the system level. The developer's information also indicates that the configuration involves time-extensive operations such as updating the stream rate limiter and potentially impacting network bandwidth, which can cause congestion. Therefore, the configuration has a substantial impact on system performance and is considered performance-sensitive."
