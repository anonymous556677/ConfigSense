    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'internode_application_receive_queue_reserve_endpoint_capacity_in_bytes' is classified as performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly impacts the system's performance by controlling the memory consumption of queued messages for delivery and processing. The code retrieves this configuration value and uses it to impose limits on message queue sizes, which can significantly affect the system's performance. Setting this value too low may result in message loss or dropped connections, while setting it too high may lead to increased memory usage and potential performance issues. Therefore, the configuration involves performance-related operations that are memory-expensive and can lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
