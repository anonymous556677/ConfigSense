    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'num_tokens' configuration is considered performance-sensitive because it directly affects the distribution of data across nodes in the cluster, leading to potential uneven data distribution and impacting system performance. The configuration involves time-extensive operations related to data distribution and load balancing, which can cause notable performance variations at the system level. Additionally, the configuration is triggered when the system starts up or when a node joins the ring, indicating its importance in system performance."
