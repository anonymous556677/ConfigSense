    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'partitioner' configuration is considered performance-sensitive because it directly affects system performance at the system level by defining the strategy for distributing rows by partition key across nodes in the cluster. Changing the partitioner configuration has a significant impact on the system as it affects how data is distributed across nodes, leading to notable performance variations. Additionally, the configuration involves performance-related operations that are time-expensive and memory-expensive within its related code, making it a critical configuration that should be carefully managed."
