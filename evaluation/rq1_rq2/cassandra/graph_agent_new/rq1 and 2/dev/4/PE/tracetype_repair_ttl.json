    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'tracetype_repair_ttl' is classified as performance-sensitive. This is because setting a higher TTL value can lead to more storage space being used to store tracing information for repair sessions, which can have a notable impact on memory consumption at the system level. Additionally, the configuration involves time-extensive operations related to tracing repair sessions, which can contribute to notable performance variations in terms of execution time."
