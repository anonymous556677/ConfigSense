    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The 'enable_sasi_indexes' configuration option does not directly involve any time-expensive or memory-expensive operations within its related code. The developer's explanation indicates that this configuration is mainly used to determine if SASI index creation is enabled on the node, and enabling it may impact system performance and stability due to the experimental nature of SASI indexes. However, the configuration itself does not lead to notable performance variations at the system level based on the provided information."
