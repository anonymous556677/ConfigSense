    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The tombstone_failure_threshold configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the handling of tombstones during read operations. Exceeding the configured threshold triggers a TombstoneOverwhelmingException, which can significantly affect the performance and stability of the system. The configuration involves performance-related operations that are time-expensive and memory-expensive, leading to notable performance variations at the system level."
