    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'write_request_timeout_in_ms' is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts system performance by determining the maximum time the coordinator will wait for write operations to complete. If this value is set too low, it can result in premature timeouts for write operations, affecting system performance. On the other hand, setting it too high can lead to increased latency for write operations, also impacting system performance. Additionally, the configuration involves time-extensive operations related to waiting for write requests to complete, which can cause notable performance variations at the system level."
