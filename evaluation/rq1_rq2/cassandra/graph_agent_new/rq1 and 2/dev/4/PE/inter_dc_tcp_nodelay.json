    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'inter_dc_tcp_nodelay' is classified as performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly impacts the size of network packets being sent during inter-datacenter communication, which can have a notable effect on system performance. Enabling or disabling tcp_nodelay can affect latency for cross-datacenter responses, leading to significant performance variations at the system level. Additionally, the configuration involves performance-related operations within its code that contribute to execution time and memory consumption, making it a performance-sensitive configuration."
