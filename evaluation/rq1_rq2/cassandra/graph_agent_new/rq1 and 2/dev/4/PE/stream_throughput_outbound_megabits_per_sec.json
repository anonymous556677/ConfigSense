    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'stream_throughput_outbound_megabits_per_sec' is performance-sensitive because it directly controls the outbound stream throughput in megabits per second for streaming file transfers between datacenters. The code snippet provided shows that the configuration value is used to calculate the rate in bytes for the file transfers. Since the configuration throttles all streaming file transfers between datacenters, any changes to this configuration can have a significant impact on system performance by affecting network traffic and resource utilization. Therefore, the configuration involves performance-related operations that are time-expensive and memory-expensive, leading to notable performance variations at the system level."
