    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'server_encryption_options' configuration is performance-sensitive. This is because it directly impacts system performance by adding encryption overhead to network communication, which can affect latency and throughput. The code initializes SSL contexts, creates SSL sockets, and manages SSL certificates, all of which are time-expensive and memory-expensive operations. These operations contribute significantly to the execution time and memory consumption of the system, leading to notable performance variations at the system level."
