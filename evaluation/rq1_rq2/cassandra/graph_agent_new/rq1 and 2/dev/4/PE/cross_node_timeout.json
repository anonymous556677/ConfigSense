    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'cross_node_timeout' configuration is performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly impacts the system performance by enabling accurate measurement of request timeouts between nodes. If disabled, it can lead to wasted processing time on already-timed-out requests under overload conditions. Additionally, the code context shows that the configuration involves time-expensive operations such as checking DatabaseDescriptor and comparing timestamps, which can contribute significantly to execution time. Therefore, the configuration is considered performance-sensitive based on its impact on system performance and the presence of time-expensive operations in its related code."
