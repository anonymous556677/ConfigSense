    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'sstable_preemptive_open_interval_in_mb' is performance-sensitive. This is because the 'calculateOpenInterval' method directly uses the value of 'sstable_preemptive_open_interval_in_mb' to determine the interval for preemptive opening of SSTables. This operation is time-expensive and can have a notable impact on the efficiency of the compaction process, affecting system performance at the system level. Additionally, the triggering frequency of this configuration during the compaction process indicates its importance in the system's performance optimization."
