    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'range_request_timeout_in_ms' configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the system performance by determining the maximum time the coordinator will wait for range scans to complete. This configuration involves time-extensive operations related to setting timeouts for range RPC calls, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. If set incorrectly, it can cause timeouts for long-running scans or increase the overall latency of the system, making it a critical configuration for system performance."
