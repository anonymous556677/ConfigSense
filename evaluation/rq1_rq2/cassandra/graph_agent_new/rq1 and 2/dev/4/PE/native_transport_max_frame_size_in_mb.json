    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'native_transport_max_frame_size_in_mb' is performance-sensitive. This is because changing this configuration directly impacts the system's performance by affecting the maximum allowed size of frames. Increasing the value can potentially lead to increased memory usage and processing time, while decreasing the value can limit the size of data that can be transferred in a single frame. The configuration involves performance-related operations that are memory-expensive and time-expensive, leading to notable performance variations at the system level."
