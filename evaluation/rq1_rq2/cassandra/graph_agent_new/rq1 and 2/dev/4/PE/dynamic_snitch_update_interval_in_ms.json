    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'dynamic_snitch_update_interval_in_ms' configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly affects the performance of the system by controlling how often the more expensive part of host score calculation is performed. This configuration involves time-extensive operations related to host score calculation, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The frequency of updates specified by this configuration can impact the system's responsiveness and load, making it a critical factor in system performance."
