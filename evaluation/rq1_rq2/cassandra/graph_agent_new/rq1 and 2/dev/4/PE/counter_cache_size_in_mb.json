    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'counter_cache_size_in_mb' configuration is classified as performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly impacts the performance of the system by affecting the size and efficiency of the counter cache in memory. The configuration involves time-expensive operations related to managing the counter cache size and memory consumption, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Additionally, the developer's information highlights the significant impact of setting the configuration value too high or too low on system performance, emphasizing the importance of optimizing the configuration based on memory availability and workload characteristics."
