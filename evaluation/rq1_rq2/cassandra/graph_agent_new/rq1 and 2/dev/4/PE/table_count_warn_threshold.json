    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'table_count_warn_threshold' configuration is considered performance-sensitive because it directly impacts system performance at the system level. Setting a threshold for the number of tables in the cluster and issuing warnings when the threshold is exceeded can lead to notable performance variations. The configuration involves performance-related operations that are time-expensive, as having a large number of tables and keyspaces can slow down schema-dependent cluster operations. Therefore, the 'table_count_warn_threshold' configuration meets the criteria of being performance-sensitive."
