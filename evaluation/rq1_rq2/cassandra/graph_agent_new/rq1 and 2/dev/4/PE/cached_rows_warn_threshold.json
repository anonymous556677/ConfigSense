    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'cached_rows_warn_threshold' configuration is considered performance-sensitive. This is because it directly impacts the system performance by limiting the number of rows from replicas that need to be materialized during queries. If the per-query threshold is breached, it can lead to warnings being logged or even query failures. This configuration involves performance-related operations that are time-expensive, as they affect the query execution time and memory consumption at the system level. Additionally, the configuration is used in the ReplicaFilteringProtection constructor, indicating its importance in managing the impact of out-of-sync replicas and optimizing page/fetch size during queries."
