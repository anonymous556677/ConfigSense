    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'slow_query_log_timeout_in_ms' is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts system performance by affecting the execution time of select queries. The code related to this configuration involves time-expensive operations to monitor and log slow queries, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Setting an appropriate timeout value is crucial for improving system performance, but incorrect settings can introduce unnecessary overhead or cause slow queries to go unnoticed, highlighting the sensitivity of this configuration."
