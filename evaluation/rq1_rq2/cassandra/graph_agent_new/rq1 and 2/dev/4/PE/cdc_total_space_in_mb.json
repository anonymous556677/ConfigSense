    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'cdc_total_space_in_mb' is performance-sensitive. This is because it directly impacts the system's performance at the system level by affecting the ability of Cassandra to store change-data-capture logs. The code related to this configuration involves time-expensive operations such as retrieving the value from DatabaseDescriptor and converting it to bytes, which can contribute significantly to execution time and memory consumption. Additionally, exceeding the configured limit for CDC logs can lead to performance issues like WriteTimeoutExceptions on Mutations, further emphasizing the performance sensitivity of this configuration."
