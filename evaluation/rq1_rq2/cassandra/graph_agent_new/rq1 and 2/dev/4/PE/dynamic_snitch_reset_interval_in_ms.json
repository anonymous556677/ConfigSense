    "Reason": "The 'dynamic_snitch_reset_interval_in_ms' configuration is not performance-sensitive. Although it involves scheduling tasks to reset host scores at regular intervals, the impact on system performance is not substantial enough to cause notable performance variations at the system level. The code snippet provided indicates that the configuration is used to maintain a dynamic and responsive endpoint snitch system by allowing bad hosts to recover, but the performance-related operations involved are not time-expensive or memory-expensive enough to be considered performance-sensitive."
