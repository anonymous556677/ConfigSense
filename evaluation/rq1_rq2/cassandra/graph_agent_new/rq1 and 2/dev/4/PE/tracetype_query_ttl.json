    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The 'tracetype_query_ttl' configuration is not performance-sensitive. Although it impacts memory consumption during the logging of trace events, the configuration itself does not involve any time-expensive or memory-expensive operations within its related code. The configuration mainly deals with setting TTL values for different trace types based on the ordinal value of the TraceType enum, which does not directly and substantially affect system performance at the system level. Therefore, it does not lead to notable performance variations that would classify it as performance-sensitive."
