    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'memtable_heap_space_in_mb' configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the system's performance at the system level. The configuration is used to set the total permitted memory for memtables, which are critical for write operations in Cassandra. The code snippet provided shows that the configuration value is used to calculate heapLimit and offHeapLimit for memtable allocation pools, indicating that it involves performance-related operations that are memory-expensive. If the configured limit is too low, it can lead to frequent flushes and impact system performance. Conversely, setting a high limit can consume more memory and potentially lead to out-of-memory errors. Therefore, the 'memtable_heap_space_in_mb' configuration can cause notable performance variations at the system level."
