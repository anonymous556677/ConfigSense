    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'commitlog_total_space_in_mb' configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the system's performance at the system level. The configuration involves time-extensive operations related to commit log management, such as calculating unused capacity and triggering flush activities. A smaller total commitlog space can lead to more frequent flush activities, impacting the overall performance and stability of the system by increasing disk I/O operations and potentially causing performance bottlenecks. Therefore, the configuration's significant impact on system performance makes it performance-sensitive."
