    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'row_cache_size_in_mb' configuration is classified as performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly impacts the amount of memory allocated for the row cache, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Setting a higher value for this configuration can consume more memory resources, potentially improving performance by caching more data. The code snippets provided show how the configuration value is used to determine the capacity of the row cache in megabytes, indicating that it involves memory-expensive operations. Additionally, the frequency of triggering the configuration depends on how often the 'initRowCache' method is called, suggesting that it has a direct impact on system performance."
