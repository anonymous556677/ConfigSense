    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'allocate_tokens_for_local_replication_factor' is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts how tokens are allocated for local replication factor, which in turn affects data distribution and replication within the cluster. The code related to this configuration involves operations that are time-expensive, such as checking for initial tokens, allocation keyspace, and choosing num_tokens at random. These operations can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, making the configuration performance-sensitive."
