    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The audit_logging_options configuration is performance-sensitive because enabling audit logging can have a significant impact on system performance and resource usage, especially with a high volume of CQL command requests. The configuration involves logging every incoming CQL command request and authentication, which can be time-expensive and memory-expensive operations. This can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, making the configuration performance-sensitive."
