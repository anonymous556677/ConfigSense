    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'internode_application_receive_queue_reserve_global_capacity_in_bytes' is classified as performance-sensitive. This is because it directly impacts the amount of memory allocated for queuing messages between nodes, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The developer's explanation also highlights the significance of setting this value correctly to avoid message queue overflow or excessive memory usage, indicating that the configuration involves memory-expensive operations that can affect system performance."
