    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'repaired_data_tracking_for_range_reads_enabled' is performance-sensitive. Enabling this configuration adds overhead to range read operations by tracking repaired data for all range reads, which can impact system performance and resource utilization. This configuration directly affects the execution time and memory consumption of range read operations, leading to notable performance variations at the system level. The developer's information also indicates that operators may choose to disable this configuration for range reads to manage the impact, further emphasizing its performance sensitivity."
