    "Reason": "The 'native_transport_idle_timeout_in_ms' configuration is not performance-sensitive. Although it involves managing idle client connections and can impact resource usage, the code snippet provided does not show any time-expensive or memory-expensive operations that would lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The configuration mainly focuses on managing idle connections to optimize resource usage and client experience, rather than directly impacting system performance in a significant way."
