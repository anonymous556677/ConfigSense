    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'enable_materialized_views' configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts system performance at the system level. Enabling or disabling materialized views can have a significant impact on system stability and performance. The code snippet related to this configuration involves checking if materialized views are enabled or disabled, and throwing an exception if they are disabled. This operation can be time-expensive and memory-expensive, leading to notable performance variations at the system level. Additionally, the developer's understanding that enabling materialized views may introduce instability or performance issues further supports the classification of this configuration as performance-sensitive."
