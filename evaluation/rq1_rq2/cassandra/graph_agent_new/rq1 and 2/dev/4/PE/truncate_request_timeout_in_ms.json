{
    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'truncate_request_timeout_in_ms' is classified as performance-sensitive. This is because the setting of this configuration directly impacts the timeout for truncates to complete in the system, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The code using this configuration to calculate the timeout for truncates and handle timeout exceptions involves time-expensive operations that can significantly affect system performance. Setting a lower value may result in more frequent timeouts, potentially causing data loss or incomplete truncates, while setting a higher value may increase the time taken for truncates to complete, impacting system performance. Therefore, the configuration 'truncate_request_timeout_in_ms' involves performance-related operations that have a substantial impact on system performance, making it performance-sensitive."
