    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'key_cache_size_in_mb' configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts system performance at the system level. The size of the key cache affects the number of cache hits and seeks, which can significantly impact the overall performance of the system. The code initializes the key cache with the specified capacity, and the scheduling of key cache key saving also indicates that this configuration involves time-expensive operations. Therefore, the configuration is considered performance-sensitive due to its direct and substantial effect on system performance."
