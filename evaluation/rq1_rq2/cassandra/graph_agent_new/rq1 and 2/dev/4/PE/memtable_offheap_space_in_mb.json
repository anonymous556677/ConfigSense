    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'memtable_offheap_space_in_mb' configuration option is classified as performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly impacts the amount of off-heap memory allocated for memtables, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The code snippet shifting the value left by 20 bits to convert from MB to bytes indicates that this configuration involves time-expensive operations. Additionally, the triggering frequency of this configuration, which initiates flush operations to free up memory when the limit is exceeded, further emphasizes its performance sensitivity. Setting this value incorrectly can result in performance degradation or potential out-of-memory errors, highlighting the substantial impact of this configuration on system performance."
