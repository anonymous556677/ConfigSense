    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'ideal_consistency_level' configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the system performance by adding overhead to the replication process for each write operation. The configuration involves tracking and ensuring the ideal consistency level, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, especially in terms of latency for write operations. The code context also indicates that the configuration involves performance-related operations that contribute to execution time and memory consumption, further supporting its classification as performance-sensitive."
