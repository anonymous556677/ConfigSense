    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'internode_application_send_queue_reserve_global_capacity_in_bytes' is classified as performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly impacts the queuing behavior and message processing efficiency within the cluster, leading to notable performance variations at the system level. The developer's explanation also highlights the significance of setting appropriate values for this configuration to maintain optimal performance and prevent message overload or delays. Additionally, the configuration involves performance-related operations that are time-extensive and memory-expensive within its related code, further supporting its classification as performance-sensitive."
