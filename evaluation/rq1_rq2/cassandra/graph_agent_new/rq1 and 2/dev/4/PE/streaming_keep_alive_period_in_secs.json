{
    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'streaming_keep_alive_period_in_secs' is classified as performance-sensitive. This is because the value of this configuration directly impacts the frequency of keep-alive messages being sent between nodes in the system, which in turn affects the stability and timeout behavior of stream sessions. The code related to scheduling keep-alive tasks at a fixed rate based on this configuration indicates that it involves time-expensive operations that can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Therefore, any changes in the value of 'streaming_keep_alive_period_in_secs' can have a substantial impact on system performance, making it performance-sensitive."
