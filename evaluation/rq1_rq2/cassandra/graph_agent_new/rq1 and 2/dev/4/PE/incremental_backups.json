    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'incremental_backups' is performance-sensitive. Enabling this configuration option leads to the creation of hard links for each sstable flushed or streamed locally, which can significantly impact the system's storage space usage. This operation is time-expensive and memory-expensive as it involves creating hard links for potentially large amounts of data. The configuration directly affects system performance at the storage level by increasing storage requirements, making it a performance-sensitive configuration."
