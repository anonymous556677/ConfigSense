{
    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'cdc_free_space_check_interval_ms' is classified as performance-sensitive. This is because the interval at which the system checks for available space in cdc_raw directly impacts the system performance. A lower interval value may lead to more frequent checks, increasing the overhead on the system, while a higher interval value may result in longer intervals between checks, potentially affecting system responsiveness. The configuration involves time-expensive operations related to checking for available space in cdc_raw, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
