    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'role_manager' is performance-sensitive. This is because the 'role_manager' configuration directly impacts the authentication and authorization operations in the system, which are critical for security and access control mechanisms. The code related to the 'role_manager' configuration involves managing role grants and memberships, which can be time-expensive and memory-expensive operations. Any inefficiencies in these operations can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, affecting the overall performance of the system."
