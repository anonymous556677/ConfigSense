    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'repair_session_space_in_mb' configuration is classified as performance-sensitive because it directly impacts memory usage during repair operations, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The configuration involves time-expensive operations related to Merkle tree calculations and validation compaction, which contribute significantly to execution time and memory consumption. Setting this configuration too low can cause heap pressure and over-streaming of data, while setting it too high can result in excessive memory consumption. Therefore, finding the right balance is crucial to ensure efficient repairs without causing memory issues, highlighting the performance sensitivity of this configuration."
