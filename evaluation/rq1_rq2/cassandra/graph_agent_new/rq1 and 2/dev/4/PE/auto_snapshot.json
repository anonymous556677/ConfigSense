    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The 'auto_snapshot' configuration option is not performance-sensitive. Although it has a significant impact on data safety by determining whether a snapshot is taken before keyspace truncation or dropping of column families, it does not directly and substantially affect system performance at the system level. The configuration does not involve any performance-related operations that are time-extensive or memory-extensive within its related code, leading to notable performance variations. Therefore, it is classified as not performance-sensitive."
