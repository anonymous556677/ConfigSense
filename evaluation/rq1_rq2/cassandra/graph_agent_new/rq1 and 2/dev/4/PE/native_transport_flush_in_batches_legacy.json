    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'native_transport_flush_in_batches_legacy' configuration option is considered performance-sensitive. This is because enabling this configuration directly impacts system performance by improving throughput performance through the utilization of native transport TCP message coalescing. The code context indicates that this configuration involves time-extensive operations related to TCP message coalescing, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, especially for systems with old kernels or very few client connections. Therefore, the configuration has a substantial effect on system performance, making it performance-sensitive."
