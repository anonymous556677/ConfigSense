{
    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'tombstone_warn_threshold' is considered performance-sensitive because it directly affects the performance and memory usage of the system. Adjusting this threshold can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, as it allows the system to scan more tombstones despite potential performance issues and heap exhaustion. The code context related to this configuration involves time-expensive operations that can impact system performance significantly. Therefore, the configuration is classified as performance-sensitive."
