    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'enable_drop_compact_storage' is classified as performance-sensitive. This is because the 'DatabaseDescriptor.enableDropCompactStorage()' method directly impacts the system performance by allowing or disallowing the use of 'ALTER ... DROP COMPACT STORAGE' statements on tables. This operation can have significant performance implications, as dropping compact storage can affect storage size and query performance. Therefore, the configuration involves performance-related operations that are time-expensive and memory-expensive, leading to notable performance variations at the system level."
