    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'allocate_tokens_for_keyspace' configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the token allocation strategy for new nodes joining the cluster. This allocation process involves time-expensive operations such as generating suitable tokens based on the allocationKeyspace or choosing num_tokens at random. These operations can significantly affect the performance and load balancing of the system at the system level. Additionally, the triggering frequency of this configuration during bootstrap or when a new node joins the cluster indicates its importance in the system's performance."
