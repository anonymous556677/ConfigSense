In case of RF = 1 a counter cache hit will cause Cassandra to skip the read before write entirely. With RF > 1 a counter cache hit will still help to reduce the duration of the lock hold, helping with hot counter cell updates, but will not allow skipping the read entirely. Only the local (clock, count) tuple of a counter cell is kept in memory, not the whole counter, so it's relatively cheap.  NOTE: if you reduce the size, you may not get you hottest keys loaded on startup.  Default value is empty to make it \"auto\" (min(2.5% of Heap (in MB), 50MB)). Set to 0 to disable counter cache. NOTE: if you perform counter deletes and rely on low gcgs, you should disable the counter cache.",

It is used to reduce counter locks' contention for hot counter cells.

    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the 'counter_cache_size_in_mb' configuration is significant on the system. Setting a higher value for the configuration can help in reducing contention for hot counter cells and improving performance by skipping read before write operations. However, setting a lower value may result in not loading the hottest keys on startup. It is recommended to set the configuration based on the system's memory availability and workload characteristics. Additionally, disabling the counter cache (setting to 0) may be necessary if counter deletes are performed frequently and low gcgs are relied upon."
