The key cache is fairly tiny for the amount of time it saves, so it's worthwhile to use it at large numbers. The row cache saves even more time, but must contain the entire row, so it is extremely space-intensive. It's best to only use the row cache if you have hot rows or static rows.  NOTE: if you reduce the size, you may not get you hottest keys loaded on startup.  Default value is empty to make it \"auto\" (min(5% of Heap (in MB), 100MB)). Set to 0 to disable key cache.",
    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The 'key_cache_size_in_mb' configuration is used to set the maximum size of the key cache in memory. The code initializes the key cache by creating an AutoSavingCache object with the specified capacity in MBs. It then schedules saving of key cache keys based on the configured save period and number of keys to save.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The configuration is triggered whenever the 'initKeyCache' method is called to initialize the key cache. The frequency of triggering depends on how often the method is invoked in the system.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the 'key_cache_size_in_mb' configuration option on the system is significant. Setting a larger size for the key cache can improve performance by reducing seek operations for cache hits. However, it also consumes more memory, so it's important to balance the size based on the available memory and the workload. On the other hand, reducing the size may lead to not loading the hottest keys on startup, affecting the system's overall performance."
