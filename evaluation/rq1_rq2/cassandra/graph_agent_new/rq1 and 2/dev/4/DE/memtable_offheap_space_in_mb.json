    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The configuration 'memtable_offheap_space_in_mb' is used in the code to set the off-heap memory limit for memtables. The value is retrieved from DatabaseDescriptor and shifted left by 20 bits to convert from MB to bytes.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The configuration is triggered when the total memory used by memtables exceeds the limit set by 'memtable_offheap_space_in_mb'. This will trigger a flush operation to free up memory and prevent Cassandra from accepting new writes until the flush completes.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the 'memtable_offheap_space_in_mb' configuration option is significant as it directly affects the amount of off-heap memory allocated for memtables. Setting this value too low may lead to frequent flushes and performance degradation, while setting it too high may result in excessive memory usage and potential out-of-memory errors."
