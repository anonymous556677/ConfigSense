    "config_description": "Throttles compaction to the given total throughput across the entire system. The faster you insert data, the faster you need to compact in order to keep the sstable count down, but in general, setting this to 16 to 32 times the rate you are inserting data is more than sufficient. Setting this to 0 disables throttling. Note that this accounts for all types of compaction, including validation compaction (building Merkle trees for repairs).",
    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The configuration 'compaction_throughput_mb_per_sec' is used to throttle compaction to a specific throughput across the entire system. It sets a rate limiter based on the value obtained from DatabaseDescriptor.getCompactionThroughputMbPerSec(). This rate limiter controls the speed of compaction to ensure it does not exceed the specified throughput.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The triggering frequency of the 'compaction_throughput_mb_per_sec' configuration depends on the rate at which data is being inserted into the system. The faster data is inserted, the more frequently compaction will be triggered to keep the sstable count down. It is recommended to set the throughput to 16 to 32 times the rate of data insertion.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the 'compaction_throughput_mb_per_sec' configuration is significant in controlling the speed and efficiency of compaction in the system. Setting it too low may result in slower compaction and potential performance issues, while setting it too high may lead to unnecessary throttling. It is crucial to adjust this configuration based on the rate of data insertion to optimize compaction performance."
