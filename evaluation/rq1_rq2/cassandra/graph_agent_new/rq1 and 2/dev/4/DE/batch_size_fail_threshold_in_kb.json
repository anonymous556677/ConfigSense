    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The triggering frequency of the 'batch_size_fail_threshold_in_kb' configuration depends on the workload and the size of the batches being processed. It will be triggered whenever a batch size exceeds the specified threshold.",

By setting a reasonable threshold, the system can handle batches more efficiently and avoid potential bottlenecks."
