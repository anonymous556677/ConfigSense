    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The configuration 'memtable_heap_space_in_mb' is used to set the total permitted memory to use for memtables in the system.

    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The triggering frequency of the 'memtable_heap_space_in_mb' configuration depends on the system's write workload and the size of the memtables. When the total memory used by memtables exceeds the configured limit, Cassandra will stop accepting writes until a flush completes. The memtable_cleanup_threshold also plays a role in triggering a flush when exceeded.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the 'memtable_heap_space_in_mb' configuration option on the system is significant. If the configured limit is too low, it can lead to frequent flushes and potentially impact the system's performance. On the other hand, setting a high limit can consume more memory and potentially lead to out-of-memory errors if not managed properly."
