    "config_description": "Global, per-endpoint and per-connection limits imposed on messages queued for delivery to other nodes and waiting to be processed on arrival from other nodes in the cluster.  These limits are applied to the on-wire size of the message being sent or received.  The basic per-link limit is consumed in isolation before any endpoint or global limit is imposed. Each node-pair has three links: urgent, small and large.  So any given node may have a maximum of N*3*(internode_application_send_queue_capacity_in_bytes+internode_application_receive_queue_capacity_in_bytes) messages queued without any coordination between them although in practice, with token-aware routing, only RF*tokens nodes should need to communicate with significant bandwidth.  The per-endpoint limit is imposed on all messages exceeding the per-link limit, simultaneously with the global limit, on all links to or from a single node in the cluster. The global limit is imposed on all messages exceeding the per-link limit, simultaneously with the per-endpoint limit, on all links to or from any node in the cluster.  internode_application_send_queue_capacity_in_bytes: 4194304                       #4MiB internode_application_send_queue_reserve_endpoint_capacity_in_bytes: 134217728    #128MiB",
    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The configuration 'internode_application_send_queue_reserve_global_capacity_in_bytes' sets the global, per-endpoint, and per-connection limits for messages queued for delivery to other nodes and waiting to be processed on arrival from other nodes in the cluster. These limits are applied to the on-wire size of the message being sent or received. The configuration works by imposing limits on message sizes and queuing behavior within the messaging service.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The configuration is triggered whenever messages are being sent or received between nodes in the cluster. The frequency of triggering depends on the volume of communication happening within the cluster.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the 'internode_application_send_queue_reserve_global_capacity_in_bytes' configuration option is significant as it directly affects the queuing behavior and message processing efficiency within the cluster. Setting appropriate values for this configuration is crucial for maintaining optimal performance and preventing message overload or delays."
