    "config_description": "Controls when idle client connections are closed. Idle connections are ones that had neither reads nor writes for a time period.  Clients may implement heartbeats by sending OPTIONS native protocol message after a timeout, which will reset idle timeout timer on the server side. To close idle client connections, corresponding values for heartbeat intervals have to be set on the client side.  Idle connection timeouts are disabled by default.",
    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The configuration 'native_transport_idle_timeout_in_ms' controls when idle client connections are closed. Idle connections are those that had neither reads nor writes for a specified time period. The code snippet provided adds an IdleStateHandler to the channel pipeline with the configured idle timeout value. When a client connection becomes idle, the channelIdle method is triggered, logging a message and closing the connection.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The triggering frequency of the 'native_transport_idle_timeout_in_ms' configuration depends on the idle behavior of client connections. If a client connection remains idle for the specified timeout period, the configured idle timeout value will trigger the channelIdle method in the code snippet, closing the connection.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the 'native_transport_idle_timeout_in_ms' configuration option is on the system's resource management. By closing idle client connections, the system can free up resources and prevent resource wastage. However, setting a very short idle timeout value may lead to frequent connection closures and potential disruptions for clients. It is important to balance the idle timeout value to optimize resource usage and client experience."
