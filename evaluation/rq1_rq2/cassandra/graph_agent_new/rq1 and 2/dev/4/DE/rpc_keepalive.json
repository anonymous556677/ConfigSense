    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The rpc_keepalive configuration in the code is used to enable or disable keepalive on rpc/native connections. It is set in the Server constructor where it is passed as a parameter to the PipelineConfigurator.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The triggering frequency of the rpc_keepalive configuration in the system depends on how often new Server instances are created or existing ones are updated with different configurations. It is typically triggered during the initialization of the Server.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the rpc_keepalive configuration option on the system is that it can affect the behavior of rpc/native connections by enabling or disabling keepalive. Enabling keepalive can help in maintaining long-lived connections and reducing connection setup overhead, while disabling it may result in more frequent connection establishment and teardown."
