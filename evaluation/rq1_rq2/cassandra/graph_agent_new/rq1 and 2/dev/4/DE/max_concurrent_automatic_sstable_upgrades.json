    "config_description": "Automatically upgrade sstables after upgrade - if there is no ordinary compaction to do, the oldest non-upgraded sstable will get upgraded to the latest version automatic_sstable_upgrade: false Limit the number of concurrent sstable upgrades",
    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The configuration 'max_concurrent_automatic_sstable_upgrades' controls the maximum number of concurrent sstable upgrade tasks that can be run automatically. The code snippet shows that the configuration is used to limit the number of upgrade tasks that can run concurrently. If the number of currently running upgrade tasks is less than or equal to the value of 'max_concurrent_automatic_sstable_upgrades', a new upgrade task can be executed.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The triggering frequency of the configuration 'max_concurrent_automatic_sstable_upgrades' depends on the availability of upgrade tasks and the current number of running tasks. If there are upgrade tasks available and the number of currently running tasks is less than the configured maximum, the configuration can be triggered to start a new upgrade task.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the configuration option 'max_concurrent_automatic_sstable_upgrades' on the system is that it helps in controlling the resource utilization by limiting the number of concurrent sstable upgrade tasks. This can prevent resource contention and ensure that the system does not become overwhelmed with upgrade tasks, thus maintaining system stability and performance."
