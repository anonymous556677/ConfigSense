    "config_description": "Total space to use for change-data-capture logs on disk.  If space gets above this value, Cassandra will throw WriteTimeoutException on Mutations including tables with CDC enabled. A CDCCompactor is responsible for parsing the raw CDC logs and deleting them when parsing is completed.  The default value is the min of 4096 mb and 1/8th of the total space of the drive where cdc_raw_directory resides.",
    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The configuration code 'cdc_total_space_in_mb' is used to determine the total space available for change-data-capture logs on disk. It retrieves the value set for CDC space in MB from the DatabaseDescriptor and multiplies it by 1024*1024 to convert it to bytes.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The triggering frequency of the 'cdc_total_space_in_mb' configuration depends on the amount of change-data-capture logs being generated and stored on disk. When the total space used for CDC logs approaches the configured limit, Cassandra will throw WriteTimeoutException on Mutations including tables with CDC enabled.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the 'cdc_total_space_in_mb' configuration option is significant as it directly affects the ability of Cassandra to store change-data-capture logs. If the space allocated for CDC logs exceeds the configured limit, it can lead to performance issues such as WriteTimeoutExceptions on Mutations. It is important to monitor and adjust this configuration based on the workload and storage capacity of the system."
