This helps to smoothly transfer reads between the sstables, reducing page cache churn and keeping hot rows hot",
    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The configuration 'sstable_preemptive_open_interval_in_mb' is used to calculate the interval for preemptive opening of SSTables. The method 'calculateOpenInterval' multiplies the value of 'sstable_preemptive_open_interval_in_mb' by 1MB and returns the interval. If certain conditions are met, the interval is set to Long.MAX_VALUE.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The triggering frequency of the 'sstable_preemptive_open_interval_in_mb' configuration depends on the compaction process in the system. Whenever compacting occurs and replacement SSTables are opened before being completely written, this configuration is triggered.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the 'sstable_preemptive_open_interval_in_mb' configuration is on the efficiency of the compaction process. By allowing replacement SSTables to be opened early, it helps in smoother transfer of reads between SSTables, reducing page cache churn and maintaining the hot rows hot."
