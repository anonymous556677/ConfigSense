If disabled, replicas will assume that requests were forwarded to them instantly by the coordinator, which means that under overload conditions we will waste that much extra time processing already-timed-out requests.  Warning: It is generally assumed that users have setup NTP on their clusters, and that clocks are modestly in sync, since this is a requirement for general correctness of last write wins.",
    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The 'cross_node_timeout' configuration is checked in the getExpiresAtNanos method to determine if operation timeout information exchange between nodes should be enabled. If the DatabaseDescriptor hasCrossNodeTimeout() returns false or if the createdAtNanos is greater than the currentTimeNanos, the createdAtNanos is set to currentTimeNanos. The method then returns the sum of createdAtNanos and expirationPeriodNanos.",

If this method is called frequently in the system, then the 'cross_node_timeout' configuration will be triggered accordingly.",

If disabled, replicas may incorrectly assume that requests were forwarded instantly, leading to wasted processing time on already-timed-out requests under overload conditions. It is important for users to have NTP setup on their clusters and ensure clock synchronization for the general correctness of last write wins."
