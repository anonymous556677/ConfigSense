    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The configuration 'internode_tcp_connect_timeout_in_ms' is used to set the amount of time to wait for internode TCP connections to establish in the Cassandra system. The code snippet provided shows that the tcpConnectTimeoutInMS method checks if the configuration value is not null and returns it, otherwise it calls the getInternodeTcpConnectTimeoutInMS method from the DatabaseDescriptor class to get the value.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The triggering frequency of the 'internode_tcp_connect_timeout_in_ms' configuration depends on the specific use case and workload of the Cassandra system. It is typically triggered when establishing internode TCP connections during communication between nodes in the cluster.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the 'internode_tcp_connect_timeout_in_ms' configuration option on the system is related to the stability and performance of internode communication. Setting a higher timeout value can help in handling network latency or congestion issues, but it may also increase the overall response time of the system. On the other hand, setting a lower timeout value may improve responsiveness but can also lead to connection failures in case of network issues."
