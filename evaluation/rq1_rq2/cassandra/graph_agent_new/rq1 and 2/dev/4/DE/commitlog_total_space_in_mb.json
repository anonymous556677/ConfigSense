So a small total commitlog space will tend to cause more flush activity on less-active columnfamilies.  The default value is the smaller of 8192, and 1/4 of the total space of the commitlog volume. ",
    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The 'commitlog_total_space_in_mb' configuration determines the total space to use for commit logs on disk in Cassandra. It is used to calculate the unused capacity by subtracting the current size of active commitlog segments from the total space specified in the configuration.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The configuration is triggered whenever the system needs to calculate the unused capacity for commit logs, which could happen when new data is written to the commit log or when a flush is triggered due to the commit log space reaching the specified limit.",

A smaller total commitlog space may lead to more frequent flush activities on less-active column families, impacting the overall performance and stability of the system."
