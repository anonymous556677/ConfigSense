This means that only partition information is held on heap and the index entries are read from disk.  Note that this size refers to the size of the serialized index information and not the size of the partition.",
    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The configuration 'column_index_cache_size_in_kb' is used to determine the size limit for sstable indexed key cache entries. If the entries exceed this size, they will not be held on heap, meaning only partition information is held on heap and index entries are read from disk.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The triggering frequency of this configuration depends on the size of the sstable indexed key cache entries. Whenever the size of the entries exceeds the specified limit, the configuration is triggered.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the 'column_index_cache_size_in_kb' configuration option is that it affects the memory usage and performance of the system. If the size limit is set too low, it may result in more disk reads and potentially slower performance. On the other hand, setting it too high may lead to increased memory usage."
