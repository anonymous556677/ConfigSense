These limits are applied to the on-wire size of the message being sent or received.  The basic per-link limit is consumed in isolation before any endpoint or global limit is imposed. Each node-pair has three links: urgent, small and large.  So any given node may have a maximum of N*3*(internode_application_send_queue_capacity_in_bytes+internode_application_receive_queue_capacity_in_bytes) messages queued without any coordination between them although in practice, with token-aware routing, only RF*tokens nodes should need to communicate with significant bandwidth.  The per-endpoint limit is imposed on all messages exceeding the per-link limit, simultaneously with the global limit, on all links to or from a single node in the cluster. The global limit is imposed on all messages exceeding the per-link limit, simultaneously with the per-endpoint limit, on all links to or from any node in the cluster. ",

The method 'applicationSendQueueCapacityInBytes' returns the value of this configuration if it is not null, otherwise it retrieves the value from the DatabaseDescriptor.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The triggering frequency of the 'internode_application_send_queue_capacity_in_bytes' configuration depends on the message traffic between nodes in the cluster. Whenever messages are queued for delivery or processing, this configuration is used to determine the capacity limits.",

It helps in managing the message queue size, preventing overload and ensuring efficient message delivery between nodes. Setting appropriate values for this configuration is crucial for maintaining system stability and preventing message loss or delays."
