    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The configuration 'periodic_commitlog_sync_lag_block_in_ms' is used in the code to determine the amount of time to block writes while waiting for a slow disk flush to complete in periodic commitlog mode. The value is converted from milliseconds to nanoseconds and used to calculate the expected sync time for committing log segments.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The triggering frequency of the 'periodic_commitlog_sync_lag_block_in_ms' configuration depends on the frequency of disk flushes and the speed of the disk. If the disk flushes are slow and cannot keep up with the write operations, the configuration will be triggered more frequently.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the 'periodic_commitlog_sync_lag_block_in_ms' configuration on the system is that it can potentially slow down the write operations if the disk flushes are slow. By blocking writes for a certain amount of time, it ensures data consistency but may also introduce latency in the system."
