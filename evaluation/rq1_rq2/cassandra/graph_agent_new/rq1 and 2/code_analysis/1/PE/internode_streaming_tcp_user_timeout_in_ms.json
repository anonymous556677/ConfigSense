    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'internode_streaming_tcp_user_timeout_in_ms' is performance-sensitive. This is because the 'internode_streaming_tcp_user_timeout_in_ms' configuration directly affects the timeout for processing incoming stream messages in the 'receive' method. The timeout value is compared with the latency of processing the incoming stream message, and if the latency exceeds the timeout, a warning message is logged. This timeout value can have a significant impact on the performance of the system, as it determines when the streaming connection might be closed. Therefore, any changes to this configuration can lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
