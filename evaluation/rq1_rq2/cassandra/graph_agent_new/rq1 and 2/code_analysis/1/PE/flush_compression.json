    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'flush_compression' is performance-sensitive. The code context provided indicates that the choice of compression algorithm for flushing SSTables directly impacts system performance. The configuration setting influences the selection of a compressor based on the flush operation type, with considerations for throughput and potential write blocking. The switch statement in the code snippet demonstrates that different compression options can be chosen, affecting the execution time and memory consumption during flush operations. Therefore, the 'flush_compression' configuration is directly tied to performance-related operations that have a notable impact on system performance."
