    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'audit_logging_options' configuration is performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly affects the system performance by enabling or disabling audit logging, which involves operations that can be time-expensive and memory-expensive. The code snippets related to the configuration show that it initializes and enables audit logging based on the provided options, which can significantly impact the system performance at the system level. Therefore, the configuration is considered performance-sensitive."
