    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'internode_application_send_queue_reserve_endpoint_capacity_in_bytes' is performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly affects the application reserve send queue endpoint capacity in bytes, which can have a notable impact on the performance of the system at the system level. The code context shows that this configuration is used to set the application reserve send queue endpoint capacity in bytes in the OutboundConnectionSettings class method withDefaultReserveLimits, indicating that it involves performance-related operations that can be time-expensive and memory-expensive."
