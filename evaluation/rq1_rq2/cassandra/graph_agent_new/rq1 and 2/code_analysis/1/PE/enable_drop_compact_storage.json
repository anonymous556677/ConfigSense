    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'enable_drop_compact_storage' is performance-sensitive. The code context reveals that this configuration parameter controls the ability to use 'ALTER ... DROP COMPACT STORAGE' statements in the system. This operation involves altering the storage format of tables, which can have a significant impact on system performance due to the restructuring of data storage. Additionally, the method 'enableDropCompactStorage' directly accesses this configuration parameter, indicating its importance in system behavior. Therefore, the configuration is classified as performance-sensitive based on its potential to cause notable performance variations at the system level."
