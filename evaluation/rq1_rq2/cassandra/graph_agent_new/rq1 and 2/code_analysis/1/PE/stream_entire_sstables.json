    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'stream_entire_sstables' is not performance-sensitive. The code snippet provided does not contain any performance-related operations that are time-expensive or memory-expensive. The method 'contained' mentioned in the code does not have any information available to determine its performance impact. Therefore, based on the code context and lack of performance-related operations, the configuration is classified as not performance-sensitive."
