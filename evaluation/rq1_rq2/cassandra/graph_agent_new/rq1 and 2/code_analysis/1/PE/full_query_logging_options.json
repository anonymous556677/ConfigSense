    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'full_query_logging_options' is performance-sensitive. The code context shows that this configuration involves operations that can have a notable impact on system performance. The 'getFullQueryLoggerOptions' method retrieves various options related to full query logging, which can potentially be time-expensive and memory-expensive. Additionally, the 'enableFullQueryLogger' method sets these options based on input parameters or default values, which can also have performance implications. Overall, the configuration directly affects system performance at the system level by handling logging options, making it performance-sensitive."
