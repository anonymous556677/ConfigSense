    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'memtable_heap_space_in_mb' is performance-sensitive. This is because the value retrieved from this configuration setting directly impacts the allocation of memory for memtables in the createMemtableAllocatorPool() method. The heapLimit calculation based on this configuration value affects the memory consumption of the system, which is a critical factor in system performance. Therefore, any changes in 'memtable_heap_space_in_mb' can lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
