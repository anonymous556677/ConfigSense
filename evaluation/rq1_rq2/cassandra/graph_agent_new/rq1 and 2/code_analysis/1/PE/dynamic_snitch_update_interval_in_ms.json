    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'dynamic_snitch_update_interval_in_ms' is performance-sensitive. This is because the 'dynamicUpdateInterval' and 'dynamicResetInterval' values directly affect the scheduling of tasks that involve time-expensive operations such as updating scores and resetting bad hosts. These tasks are scheduled at fixed intervals using the 'updateSchedular' and 'resetSchedular' objects, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Additionally, the 'applyConfigChanges' method adjusts these intervals based on configuration changes, further emphasizing the performance sensitivity of this configuration."
