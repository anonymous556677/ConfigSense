    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'internode_tcp_user_timeout_in_ms' is classified as performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the 'tcpUserTimeoutInMS' method directly returns the value of 'internode_tcp_user_timeout_in_ms' if it is not null, which indicates that this configuration has a direct impact on the timeout value used in messaging and streaming connections. This timeout value can significantly affect the performance of the system, especially in scenarios where messaging and streaming connections are critical for system operations. Therefore, any changes to this configuration can lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
