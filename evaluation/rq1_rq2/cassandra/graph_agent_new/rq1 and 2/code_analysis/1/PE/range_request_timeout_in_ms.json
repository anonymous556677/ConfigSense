{
    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'range_request_timeout_in_ms' is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the 'getRangeRpcTimeout' method in the provided code context directly accesses the 'DatabaseDescriptor.getRangeRpcTimeout' method, which is a system-level configuration related to RPC timeout. This configuration is crucial for controlling the timeout duration of range requests in the system, which can have a significant impact on system performance. Additionally, the 'getRangeRpcTimeout' method is called in multiple places within the code, indicating its importance in determining performance. Therefore, any changes to this configuration can lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
