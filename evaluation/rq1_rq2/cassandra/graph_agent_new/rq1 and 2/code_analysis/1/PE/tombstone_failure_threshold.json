    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'tombstone_failure_threshold' is not performance-sensitive. The code related to this configuration does not involve any performance-related operations that are time-expensive or memory-expensive. The configuration is used to retrieve the tombstone failure threshold value, which does not directly and substantially affect system performance at the system level."
