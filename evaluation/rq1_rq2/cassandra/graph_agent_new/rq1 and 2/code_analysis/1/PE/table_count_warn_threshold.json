    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'table_count_warn_threshold' is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the 'tableCount' variable in the code context is compared to the 'tableCountWarnThreshold' configuration value, which determines when a client warning should be sent based on the number of tables/keyspaces in the cluster. This comparison directly impacts the execution path of the program and can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, especially when the number of tables exceeds the warning threshold. Therefore, the configuration involves performance-related operations that are time-expensive and can significantly affect system performance."
