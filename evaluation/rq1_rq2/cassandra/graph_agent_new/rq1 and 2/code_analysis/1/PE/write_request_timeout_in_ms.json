    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'write_request_timeout_in_ms' is not performance-sensitive. The code context related to this configuration does not involve any performance-related operations that are time-expensive or memory-expensive. The methods like 'applyInternal' and 'excise' do not directly and substantially affect system performance at the system level. Additionally, the configuration itself does not lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
