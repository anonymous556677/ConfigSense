{
    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'repair_session_space_in_mb' is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the 'repair_session_space_in_mb' configuration directly affects the amount of memory allocated for creating Merkle trees in the 'createMerkleTrees' method. The calculation of 'availableBytes' based on 'DatabaseDescriptor.getRepairSessionSpaceInMegabytes()' and its usage in determining 'rangeAvailableBytes' and 'maxDepth' significantly impacts the memory consumption during the creation of Merkle trees. This memory-intensive operation can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, making the configuration performance-sensitive."
