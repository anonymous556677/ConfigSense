    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'auto_snapshot' is performance-sensitive. The 'auto_snapshot' configuration directly affects system performance by triggering a snapshot operation when truncating a column family. This snapshot operation involves time-expensive and memory-expensive operations such as flushing memtables, truncating indexes, and saving truncation records. These operations can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Additionally, the code context shows that the configuration interacts with other performance-related operations like flushing memtables and truncating indexes, further indicating its performance sensitivity."
