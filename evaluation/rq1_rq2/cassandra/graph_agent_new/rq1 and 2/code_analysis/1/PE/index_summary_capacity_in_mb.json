    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'index_summary_capacity_in_mb' is performance-sensitive. The code context shows that the configuration value is used to set the memory pool size in MB for the index summary manager. This directly impacts the memory consumption of the system, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The 'getIndexSummaryCapacityInMB' method is specifically related to retrieving this configuration value, indicating its importance in determining the memory allocation for the system."
