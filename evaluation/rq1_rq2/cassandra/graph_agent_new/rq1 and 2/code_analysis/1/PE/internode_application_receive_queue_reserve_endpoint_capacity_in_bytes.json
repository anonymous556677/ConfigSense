    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'internode_application_receive_queue_reserve_endpoint_capacity_in_bytes' is performance-sensitive. This is because it directly affects the system's messaging service performance by setting the endpoint capacity for the application receive queue reserve. The code context shows that this configuration impacts the outbound and inbound messaging connections, with strict memory utilization limits and flow control mechanisms in place to prevent overwhelming the system with enqueued, undelivered messages. Therefore, changes to this configuration can lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
