    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'tombstone_warn_threshold' is not performance-sensitive. The code related to this configuration does not involve any performance-related operations that are time-expensive or memory-expensive. The configuration is a simple getter method that retrieves the 'TombstoneWarnThreshold' value from the 'DatabaseDescriptor', which is a constant value used for warning thresholds. This configuration does not directly and substantially affect system performance at the system level, and it does not lead to notable performance variations."
