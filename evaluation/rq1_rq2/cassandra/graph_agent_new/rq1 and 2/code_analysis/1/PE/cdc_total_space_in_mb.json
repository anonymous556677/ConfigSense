    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option cdc_total_space_in_mb is performance-sensitive. The code context provided shows that the value of cdc_total_space_in_mb is used in the method allowableCDCBytes() to calculate the allowable CDC bytes. This calculation involves multiplication operations that can be time-expensive. Additionally, the unclear method getCDCSpaceInMB() directly retrieves the value of cdc_total_space_in_mb from the configuration, indicating that changes in this configuration can have a direct impact on the performance of the system at the system level."
