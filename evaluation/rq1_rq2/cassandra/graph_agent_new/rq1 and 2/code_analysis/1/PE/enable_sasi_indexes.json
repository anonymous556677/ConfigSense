    "Reason": "The configuration option 'enable_sasi_indexes' is not performance-sensitive based on the provided code context. The code snippet primarily deals with validating and creating indexes in a keyspace and table. There are no performance-intensive operations or configurations that directly and substantially affect system performance at the system level. The configuration is more focused on index creation and validation, which does not lead to notable performance variations."
