    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'dynamic_snitch_reset_interval_in_ms' is performance-sensitive. This is because the 'dynamicResetInterval' setting directly affects the frequency at which the system resets host scores, impacting the performance of the system. The code context shows that the 'dynamicResetInterval' is used to schedule a task that resets host scores at a specified interval. This operation is time-expensive and directly influences the system's performance by allowing bad hosts to recover. Therefore, the configuration is performance-sensitive as it involves performance-related operations that have a notable impact on system performance."
