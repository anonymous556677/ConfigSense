    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'inter_dc_tcp_nodelay' is classified as performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the 'tcpNoDelay' method contains logic that checks if the communication is happening within the same datacenter or not, and based on that, it decides whether to enable or disable tcp_nodelay for inter-dc communication. This decision directly impacts the performance of inter-dc communication at the system level, making it a performance-sensitive configuration."
