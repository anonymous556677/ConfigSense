    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'cas_contention_timeout_in_ms' is performance-sensitive. The code context provided shows that the configuration directly affects the performance of the system by determining how long a coordinator should continue to retry a CAS operation that contends with other proposals for the same row. The configuration involves performance-related operations such as retrying Paxos rounds until the timeout, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Additionally, the configuration is tightly coupled with time-expensive and memory-expensive operations within the related code, indicating its performance sensitivity."
