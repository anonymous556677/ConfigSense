{
    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'compaction_throughput_mb_per_sec' is classified as performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the configuration directly affects the compaction rate limiter, which in turn impacts the rate at which compaction operations are performed in the system. The code context provided shows that the configuration value is used to set the rate limit for compaction operations, indicating that changes to this configuration can have a notable impact on system performance by affecting the speed of compaction operations."
