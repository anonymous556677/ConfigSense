    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The 'network_authorizer' configuration does not appear to be performance-sensitive based on the provided code context. The configuration mainly deals with user authentication and role management, which are not time-expensive or memory-expensive operations. The code related to the 'network_authorizer' configuration does not involve any performance-related operations that would lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Therefore, the configuration is classified as not performance-sensitive."
