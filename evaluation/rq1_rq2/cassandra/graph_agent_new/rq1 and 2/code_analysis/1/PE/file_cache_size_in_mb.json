    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'file_cache_size_in_mb' is performance-sensitive. The 'file_cache_size_in_mb' value is used in the calculation of 'cacheSize' in the ChunkCache class, which directly affects the memory consumption and size of the cache. The 'cacheSize' calculation is essential for determining the maximum weight of the cache and impacts the overall performance of the system by influencing the memory usage and cache efficiency. Therefore, any changes to 'file_cache_size_in_mb' can lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
