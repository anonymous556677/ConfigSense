    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'file_cache_enabled' is performance-sensitive. The 'file_cache_enabled' configuration directly affects the system performance at the system level by enabling or disabling the ChunkCache instance based on the value of 'enabled'. This configuration involves performance-related operations such as cache size calculation, cache initialization, cache loading, cache invalidation, and cache capacity management within the ChunkCache class. These operations are time-expensive and memory-expensive, leading to notable performance variations at the system level."
