    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'enable_transient_replication' is performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly affects the system performance by checking if transient replication is enabled or disabled in the system. The code snippet related to this configuration involves operations that contribute to execution time and memory consumption, such as checking for transient replicas and throwing exceptions based on the configuration settings. These operations can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, making the configuration performance-sensitive."
