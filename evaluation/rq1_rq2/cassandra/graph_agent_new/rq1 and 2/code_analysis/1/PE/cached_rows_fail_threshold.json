    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'cached_rows_fail_threshold' is not performance-sensitive based on the provided code context and developer's information. The method 'resolveWithReplicaFilteringProtection' primarily deals with replica filtering protection and does not involve any performance-related operations that are time-expensive or memory-expensive. The configuration is used in the context of setting a threshold value for cached replica rows fail, which does not directly and substantially affect system performance at the system level. Therefore, the configuration does not lead to notable performance variations and is not considered performance-sensitive."
