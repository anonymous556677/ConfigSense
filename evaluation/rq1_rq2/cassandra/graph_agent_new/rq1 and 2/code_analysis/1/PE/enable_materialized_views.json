    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'enable_materialized_views' is not performance-sensitive. The code related to this configuration does not involve any performance-related operations that are time-expensive or memory-expensive. The configuration mainly deals with validation and building of materialized views, which do not have a significant impact on system performance at the system level. The code focuses on ensuring the correctness of the materialized views and does not introduce any operations that would cause notable performance variations."
