    "Reason": "The configuration 'cached_rows_warn_threshold' is not performance-sensitive. The code snippet provided does not show any direct performance-related operations that are time-expensive or memory-expensive within the context of this configuration. The configuration is simply returning a value from 'DatabaseDescriptor.getCachedReplicaRowsWarnThreshold()', which does not involve any significant performance impact at the system level."
