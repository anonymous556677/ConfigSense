{
    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'tracetype_query_ttl' is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the 'Tracing' class contains methods and operations that directly impact system performance. For example, methods like 'getSessionId', 'getTraceType', 'newSession', 'stopSession', 'traceOutgoingMessage', and 'addTraceHeaders' involve time-expensive and memory-expensive operations that contribute significantly to execution time and memory consumption. These operations lead to notable performance variations at the system level, making the 'tracetype_query_ttl' configuration performance-sensitive."
