    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option native_transport_flush_in_batches_legacy is performance-sensitive. The method useNativeTransportLegacyFlusher() directly accesses this configuration parameter, which determines whether to use native transport TCP message coalescing. This configuration can impact throughput, especially during upgrades to version 4.0 and in scenarios with old kernels or few client connections. The use of native transport legacy flusher can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, making it a performance-sensitive configuration."
