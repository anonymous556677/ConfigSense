    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'internode_application_send_queue_capacity_in_bytes' is performance-sensitive. This is because the code context provided shows that this configuration directly impacts the application send queue capacity in bytes, which can have a significant impact on the performance of message delivery to other nodes in the cluster. The method 'applicationSendQueueCapacityInBytes' retrieves this configuration value, indicating its importance in determining system performance. Additionally, the unclear method 'getInternodeApplicationSendQueueCapacityInBytes' further confirms the direct relation of this configuration to performance-sensitive operations."
