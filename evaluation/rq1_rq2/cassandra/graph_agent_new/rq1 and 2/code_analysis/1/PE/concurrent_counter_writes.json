    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'concurrent_counter_writes' is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the 'CounterMutation' class involves operations that are time-expensive and memory-expensive. The 'CounterMutation' class contains methods such as 'applyCounterMutation' and 'grabCounterLocks' that perform operations like acquiring locks, reading values from cache and CF, and updating counter values. These operations directly impact system performance at the system level by introducing notable performance variations due to their time and memory consumption."
