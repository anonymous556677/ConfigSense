    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'streaming_keep_alive_period_in_secs' is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the 'streaming_keep_alive_period_in_secs' directly affects the keep-alive period for streaming connections, which can have a significant impact on system performance. The code context shows that this configuration is used to schedule keep-alive tasks with a specific period, and increasing this period can potentially improve system performance by reducing the frequency of keep-alive tasks. Therefore, any changes to this configuration can lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
