{
    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'cdc_free_space_check_interval_ms' is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the configuration involves performance-related operations that are time-extensive within its related code. The 'CDCSizeTracker' class, which is part of the configuration, performs size calculations and recalculation operations that directly impact the system performance at the system level. These operations contribute significantly to execution time and memory consumption, leading to notable performance variations. Therefore, the configuration is considered performance-sensitive based on the code context and the nature of the operations it performs."
