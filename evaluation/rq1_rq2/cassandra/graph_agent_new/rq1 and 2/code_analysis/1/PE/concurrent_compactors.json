    "classification_result": "Performance-insensitive with 100% confidence",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'Number of simultaneous compactions to allow' is performance-insensitive because it mainly focuses on optimizing read performance in a mixed read/write workload by managing the compaction process. It does not directly impact system performance or involve time-dependent aspects of system operation."
