{
    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'counter_write_request_timeout_in_ms' is classified as performance-sensitive. This is because the 'counter_write_request_timeout_in_ms' configuration directly affects the timeout values for counter write requests, which are crucial operations in the system. The code context provided shows that the configuration is used in various methods to determine timeout values for different types of write operations. These timeout values can significantly impact the performance of the system by affecting the execution time of write requests. Therefore, the 'counter_write_request_timeout_in_ms' configuration is considered performance-sensitive as it directly influences system performance at the system level."
