    "Reason": "The 'authorizer' configuration option is not performance-sensitive. The code related to the 'authorizer' configuration does not involve any time-expensive or memory-expensive operations that would lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The configuration-related code mainly deals with authentication, authorization, and role management, which are not directly impacting system performance in a significant way."
