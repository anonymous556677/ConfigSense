    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'batch_size_fail_threshold_in_kb' is performance-sensitive. The code context shows that this configuration parameter is directly related to determining the batch size failure threshold in kilobytes. This threshold value can have a significant impact on the performance of batch operations at the system level. Since batch operations can be time-expensive and memory-expensive, any changes to this configuration parameter can lead to notable performance variations in the system. Therefore, the configuration is considered performance-sensitive."
