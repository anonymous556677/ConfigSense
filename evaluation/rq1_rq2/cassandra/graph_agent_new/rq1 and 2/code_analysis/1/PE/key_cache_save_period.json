    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'key_cache_save_period' is performance-sensitive. The 'key_cache_save_period' configuration directly affects the system performance by determining the interval at which the key cache entries are saved. The 'scheduleSaving' method uses this configuration value to schedule the saving of key cache entries, which involves time-expensive operations. Any changes to the 'key_cache_save_period' configuration can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, making it performance-sensitive."
