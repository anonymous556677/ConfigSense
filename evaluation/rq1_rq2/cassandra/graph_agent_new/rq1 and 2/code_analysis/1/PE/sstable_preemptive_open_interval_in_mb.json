    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'sstable_preemptive_open_interval_in_mb' is performance-sensitive. This is because the value of this configuration directly impacts the interval at which replacement sstables can be opened, which can have a significant effect on system performance. The code snippets provided show that this configuration is used to calculate the open interval in bytes, and if certain conditions are met, it can set the interval to a very high value. Additionally, the method 'getSSTablePreemptiveOpenIntervalInMB' retrieves this configuration value and handles a special case for Windows systems, indicating its importance in system performance."
