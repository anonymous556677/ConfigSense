{
    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'internode_tcp_connect_timeout_in_ms' is classified as performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the 'tcpConnectTimeoutInMS' method directly retrieves the internode TCP connect timeout value, which can have a notable impact on system performance. The method involves a performance-related operation by fetching the timeout value, which can be time-expensive depending on the value retrieved. This configuration directly affects system performance at the system level by potentially causing delays in internode communication, making it performance-sensitive."
