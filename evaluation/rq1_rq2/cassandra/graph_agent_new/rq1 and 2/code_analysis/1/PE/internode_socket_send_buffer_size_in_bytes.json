    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'internode_socket_send_buffer_size_in_bytes' is performance-sensitive. This is because the value of this configuration directly affects the socket buffer size for internode communication, which can have a significant impact on system performance. The code context shows that the method 'socketSendBufferSizeInBytes' retrieves this configuration value, indicating that it is used in performance-related operations. Therefore, changes to this configuration can lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
