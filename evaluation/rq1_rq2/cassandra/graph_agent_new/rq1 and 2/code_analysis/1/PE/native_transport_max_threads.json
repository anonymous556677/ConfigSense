    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'native_transport_max_threads' is performance-sensitive. The code context reveals that the 'native_transport_max_threads' configuration directly impacts the execution of the 'requestExecutor' LocalAwareExecutorService, which is used for processing native transport requests. The 'native_transport_max_threads' value influences the thread pool size, affecting the concurrency and throughput of handling incoming requests. This configuration directly affects the performance of the system by controlling the number of threads available for processing requests, leading to notable performance variations at the system level."
