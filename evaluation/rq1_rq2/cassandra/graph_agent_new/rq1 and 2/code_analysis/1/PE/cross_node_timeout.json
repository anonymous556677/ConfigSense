    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'cross_node_timeout' is performance-sensitive. The code context shows that the 'cross_node_timeout' configuration directly influences the behavior of the method 'getExpiresAtNanos' by determining whether to adjust the 'createdAtNanos' value based on the timeout condition. This adjustment can potentially impact the execution time of the method, leading to notable performance variations at the system level. Additionally, the 'hasCrossNodeTimeout' method is directly related to the 'cross_node_timeout' configuration, indicating that this configuration parameter plays a significant role in determining system performance."
