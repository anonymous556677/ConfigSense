    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'request_timeout_in_ms' is performance-sensitive. The 'getRpcTimeout' method is called multiple times within the 'HandshakeProtocol' class, and the 'getRpcTimeout' method itself retrieves the RPC timeout value from the system configuration. This timeout value is used in network communication during the handshake phase, which is a critical part of the internode protocol. Any delay or inefficiency in this configuration can directly impact the performance of the system at the network communication level, leading to notable performance variations."
