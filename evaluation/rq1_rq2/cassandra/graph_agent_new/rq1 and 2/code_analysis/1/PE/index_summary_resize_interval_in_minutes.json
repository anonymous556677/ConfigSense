    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'index_summary_resize_interval_in_minutes' is classified as performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the 'getIndexSummaryResizeIntervalInMinutes' method retrieves the value from the configuration to determine the interval for resampling index summaries. This interval directly impacts the performance of the system by affecting the frequency at which index summaries are resampled, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
