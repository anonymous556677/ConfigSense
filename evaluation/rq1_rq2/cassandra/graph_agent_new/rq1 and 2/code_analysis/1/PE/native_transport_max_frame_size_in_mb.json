    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'native_transport_max_frame_size_in_mb' is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the 'native_transport_max_frame_size_in_mb' configuration directly affects the maximum total length of the message envelope in the system. The 'MAX_TOTAL_LENGTH' constant is used in the 'Decoder' class to determine the maximum allowed length of a request, and exceeding this length leads to an exception being thrown. This shows that the configuration has a direct and substantial impact on system performance by limiting the size of messages that can be processed, thus affecting overall system efficiency."
