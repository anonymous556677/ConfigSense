    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'server_encryption_options' configuration is performance-sensitive. The configuration involves operations related to SSL encryption, which are time-expensive and memory-expensive. The SSL encryption operations directly impact system performance at the system level, leading to notable performance variations. The configuration code includes methods like 'createSSLContext' and 'getOrCreateSslContext' that handle SSL context creation and management, which are critical for system performance."
