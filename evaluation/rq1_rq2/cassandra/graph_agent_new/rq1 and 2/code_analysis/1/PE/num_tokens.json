    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'num_tokens' is performance-sensitive. The method 'getBootstrapTokens' directly references 'DatabaseDescriptor.getNumTokens()' to determine the number of tokens, which can impact the bootstrap process. Additionally, the method 'validateTransientReplication' checks 'DatabaseDescriptor.getNumTokens()' to determine if transient replication is supported with vnodes. These direct references to 'DatabaseDescriptor.getNumTokens()' within performance-related operations indicate that changes to 'num_tokens' can have a notable performance impact at the system level."
