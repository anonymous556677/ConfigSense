    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'internode_application_receive_queue_capacity_in_bytes' is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the 'applicationReceiveQueueCapacityInBytes' configuration parameter directly affects the capacity of the application receive queue, which is crucial for handling inbound messages in the MessagingService. The code snippet shows that this configuration parameter is checked for validity and used in the creation of 'InboundConnectionSettings'. The 'applicationReceiveQueueCapacityInBytes' configuration parameter is a memory-expensive operation that can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, making it performance-sensitive."
