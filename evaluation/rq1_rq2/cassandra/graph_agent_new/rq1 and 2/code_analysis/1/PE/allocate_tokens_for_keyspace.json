{
    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'allocate_tokens_for_keyspace' is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the configuration involves operations that directly impact system performance at the system level. The code context provided shows that the configuration determines token allocation for nodes in a Cassandra cluster, which is a critical operation for cluster performance. The configuration-related code includes operations such as token allocation based on keyspace and replication factor, which are time-expensive and memory-expensive operations. These operations can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, making the configuration performance-sensitive."
