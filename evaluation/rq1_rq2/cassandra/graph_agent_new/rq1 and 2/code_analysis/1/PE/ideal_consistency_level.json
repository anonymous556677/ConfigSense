{
    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'ideal_consistency_level' is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the 'ideal_consistency_level' configuration directly affects the performance of the system at the system level. The code context provided shows that the 'ideal_consistency_level' configuration is used in the 'getWriteResponseHandler' method to determine the consistency level for write operations. This configuration involves performance-related operations that are time-extensive and memory-expensive within the related code, leading to notable performance variations at the system level."
