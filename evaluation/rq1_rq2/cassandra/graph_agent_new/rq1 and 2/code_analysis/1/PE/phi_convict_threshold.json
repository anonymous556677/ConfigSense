    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'phi_convict_threshold' is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the 'phi_convict_threshold' directly impacts the performance of the system by influencing the failure detection mechanism in the 'convict' method. The comparison 'if (phi < 2 * DatabaseDescriptor.getPhiConvictThreshold())' in the 'convict' method is a performance-related operation that is time-expensive and memory-expensive, as it determines when to trigger a failure detection action. This operation can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, making the configuration performance-sensitive."
