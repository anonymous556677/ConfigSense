    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'row_cache_size_in_mb' is performance-sensitive. This is because the 'row_cache_size_in_mb' configuration directly affects the capacity of the row cache in memory, which can have a substantial impact on system performance. The code snippets provided show that the row cache size is used to set the capacity of the cache, and this can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Additionally, the method getRowCacheSizeInMB() retrieves this configuration value, further emphasizing its importance in determining system performance."
