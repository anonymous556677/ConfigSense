    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'internode_authenticator' configuration option is performance-sensitive. This is because the 'internode_authenticator' directly affects system performance at the system level by setting the internode authenticator for network communication. The code snippet related to this configuration involves setting the internode authenticator using 'DatabaseDescriptor.setInternodeAuthenticator(FBUtilities.construct(conf.internode_authenticator, \"internode_authenticator\"));'. This operation is time-expensive and memory-expensive as it involves setting up the internode authenticator for network communication, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
