    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'stream_throughput_outbound_megabits_per_sec' is classified as performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly affects the throughput of outbound data streams in megabits per second, which can have a significant impact on system performance. The code context shows that changing the value of this configuration triggers the update of the stream throughput and rate limiter, indicating that it plays a crucial role in managing data transfer speeds. Additionally, the 'calculateRateInBytes' method calculates the rate in bytes based on the configured throughput, further emphasizing the performance sensitivity of this configuration."
