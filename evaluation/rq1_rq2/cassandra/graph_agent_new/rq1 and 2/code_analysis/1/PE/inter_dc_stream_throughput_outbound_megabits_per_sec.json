    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'inter_dc_stream_throughput_outbound_megabits_per_sec' is classified as performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly affects the inter-DC stream throughput in megabits per second, which can have a significant impact on system performance. The code context shows that changing this configuration triggers the update of the inter-DC throughput and calculates the rate in bytes based on the configured throughput. These operations are time-expensive and memory-expensive, leading to notable performance variations at the system level."
