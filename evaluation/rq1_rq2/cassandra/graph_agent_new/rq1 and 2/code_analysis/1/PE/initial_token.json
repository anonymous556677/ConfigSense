    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'initial_token' configuration option is performance-sensitive. This is because the 'getBootstrapTokens' method contains code that checks for the presence of 'initialTokens' and 'allocationKeyspace' configurations. Depending on the presence of these configurations, different token allocation algorithms are used, which can have a significant impact on system performance. The method also contains checks for the number of tokens and warns about potential performance issues. Additionally, the 'allocateTokens' method is responsible for token allocation based on keyspace and replication factor, which are crucial factors affecting system performance. Therefore, the configuration directly and substantially affects system performance at the system level, making it performance-sensitive."
