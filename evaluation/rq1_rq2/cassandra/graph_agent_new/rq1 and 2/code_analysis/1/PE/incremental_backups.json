    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'incremental_backups' is performance-sensitive. The method 'isIncrementalBackupsEnabled' directly reads the value of this configuration setting to determine if incremental backups are enabled. Enabling incremental backups can lead to additional operations during the backup process, which can be time-expensive and memory-expensive. This configuration setting can directly and substantially affect system performance at the system level by introducing additional backup operations, leading to notable performance variations."
