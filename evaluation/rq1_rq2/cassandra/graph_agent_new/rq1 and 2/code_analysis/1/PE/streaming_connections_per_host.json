    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'streaming_connections_per_host' is classified as performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the 'streaming_connections_per_host' configuration directly affects the number of connections per host for streaming operations. This can have a significant impact on performance at the system level, as it can influence the efficiency of data transfer and synchronization during streaming processes. Additionally, the code context shows that this configuration parameter is used in the 'RangeStreamer' class to control the number of connections per host for streaming, indicating that it plays a crucial role in performance-related operations within the code."
