{
    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'read_request_timeout_in_ms' is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the configuration involves multiple performance-related operations that are time-expensive, such as initializing Memtable, loading SSTables, creating compaction strategies, registering MBeans, initializing metrics, setting up server internals, and scheduling periodic tasks. These operations directly impact system performance at the system level by consuming significant time and memory resources. Additionally, the configuration code includes methods like 'getTimeout' and 'getReadRpcTimeout' that directly interact with the system's read RPC timeout, which is a critical performance parameter. Therefore, the configuration is considered performance-sensitive based on the significant performance impact it has on the system."
