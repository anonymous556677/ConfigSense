    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'native_transport_idle_timeout_in_ms' is performance-sensitive. The code context shows that this configuration controls the idle timeout for client connections, and when the idle timeout is reached, the client connection is closed. This operation of closing idle client connections based on a specified time period in milliseconds can have a notable performance impact at the system level, especially if there are a large number of client connections being managed. Therefore, this configuration directly and substantially affects system performance by potentially reducing resource usage and improving system efficiency."
