    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'cluster_name' configuration is performance-sensitive. The configuration involves performance-related operations that are time-expensive and memory-expensive within its related code. The 'cluster_name' configuration directly and substantially affects system performance at the system level, leading to notable performance variations. The code context contains operations that contribute significantly to execution time and memory consumption, impacting system performance."
