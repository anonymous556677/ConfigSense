    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'snapshot_links_per_second' is classified as performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the 'snapshot_links_per_second' configuration directly affects the rate at which snapshots are created or cleared, which can have a significant impact on system performance. The code context shows that this configuration is used to create a RateLimiter, which can throttle the creation or clearing of snapshots to avoid performance impact, especially on consumer-grade SSDs. Therefore, any changes in the 'snapshot_links_per_second' value can lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
