    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'repaired_data_tracking_for_range_reads_enabled' is performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly affects the performance of the system by enabling or disabling data tracking for range reads. The code snippet provided shows that the configuration is used to determine whether to request repaired data tracking info from full replicas, which can have a significant impact on the execution time and memory consumption of range read operations. Therefore, the presence or absence of this configuration setting can lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
