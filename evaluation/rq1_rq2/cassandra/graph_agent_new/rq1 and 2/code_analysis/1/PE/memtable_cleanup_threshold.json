    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'memtable_cleanup_threshold' is performance-sensitive. The code context provided shows that the 'cleaningThreshold' parameter is directly used in the creation of MemtablePool, which is a critical component for memory management in the system. The value of 'cleaningThreshold' affects the behavior of the MemtablePool and can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Additionally, the 'getMemtableCleanupThreshold' method directly retrieves the value of 'memtable_cleanup_threshold' from the configuration, indicating its importance in system performance."
