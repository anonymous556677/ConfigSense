    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'concurrent_materialized_view_builders' is performance-sensitive. The 'concurrent_materialized_view_builders' configuration directly affects the system performance by controlling the number of concurrent view builders allowed. This configuration is used to manage the execution of materialized view builder tasks, which are time-expensive operations that can have a notable impact on system performance. The code context reveals that this configuration is used to set the number of concurrent view builders, which can significantly affect the execution time and memory consumption of the system-level operations related to materialized view building. Therefore, based on the code context and the system-level impact of controlling concurrent view builders, the 'concurrent_materialized_view_builders' configuration is classified as performance-sensitive."
