    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'key_cache_size_in_mb' is performance-sensitive. The key cache size directly affects the memory consumption of the system, as it initializes a cache with a specified capacity in MBs. The code context shows that the key cache size is used to calculate the memory capacity for the cache, which can have a significant impact on the overall system performance. Additionally, the key cache is used to store key-value pairs, which can be time-expensive and memory-expensive operations. Therefore, any changes to the key cache size configuration can lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
