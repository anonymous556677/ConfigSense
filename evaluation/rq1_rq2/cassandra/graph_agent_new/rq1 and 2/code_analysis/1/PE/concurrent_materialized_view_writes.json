{
    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'concurrent_materialized_view_writes' is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the 'ViewManager' class contains methods like 'updatesAffectView' and 'reload' which involve iterating over mutations and building views, which are time-expensive operations. These operations directly impact system performance at the system level by potentially causing notable performance variations due to the concurrent management of materialized views. Additionally, the use of locks in the 'ViewManager' class indicates the need for synchronization, which can also affect performance. Therefore, the configuration is considered performance-sensitive based on the code context and the potential impact on system performance."
