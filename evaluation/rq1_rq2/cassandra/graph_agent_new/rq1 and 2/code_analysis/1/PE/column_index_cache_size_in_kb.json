    "Reason": "The configuration option 'column_index_cache_size_in_kb' is performance-sensitive. The code context shows that this configuration directly impacts the size of the column index cache, which can have a significant effect on system performance. The method 'getColumnIndexCacheSize' retrieves this configuration value, indicating that it is crucial for determining the cache size. Changes in this configuration can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, making it performance-sensitive."
