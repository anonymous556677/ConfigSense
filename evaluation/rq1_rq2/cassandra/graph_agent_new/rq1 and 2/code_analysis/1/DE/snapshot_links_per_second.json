A non-zero value here can be used to throttle these links to avoid negative performance impact of taking and clearing snapshots",
    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The configuration 'snapshot_links_per_second' is used to throttle the creation or clearing of snapshot links in the system. It is retrieved using the 'getSnapshotLinksPerSecond' method and passed to the RateLimiter.create method to create a RateLimiter object.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The triggering frequency of the 'snapshot_links_per_second' configuration depends on the frequency of creating or clearing snapshots in the system. It is triggered whenever a snapshot operation is performed, which can vary based on the system's snapshot schedule or manual snapshot triggers.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the 'snapshot_links_per_second' configuration is significant in terms of performance optimization. Setting a non-zero value can throttle the creation or clearing of snapshot links, which helps in avoiding negative performance impacts, especially on consumer grade SSDs. This configuration can help in managing the system's resources efficiently and prevent performance degradation during snapshot operations."
