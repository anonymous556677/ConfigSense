    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The configuration 'max_hints_file_size_in_mb' is used to set the maximum size for a single hints file in megabytes. In the provided code snippet, the value of 'maxHintsFileSize' is retrieved using 'DatabaseDescriptor.getMaxHintsFileSize()' and is used to determine when to break the loop while writing hints to the file.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The triggering frequency of the 'max_hints_file_size_in_mb' configuration depends on how often the 'flushInternal' method is called in the system. If the method is called frequently with large amounts of data, the configuration will be triggered more often.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the 'max_hints_file_size_in_mb' configuration option is that it limits the size of each hints file. If the size of the hints file exceeds the configured maximum size, the writing process will stop and a new hints file will be created. This helps in managing the size of hints files and prevents them from becoming too large, which could potentially impact the performance and stability of the system."
