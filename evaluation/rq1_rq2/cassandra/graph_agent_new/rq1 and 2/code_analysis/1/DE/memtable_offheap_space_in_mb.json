    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The 'memtable_offheap_space_in_mb' configuration is used to set the total permitted off-heap memory to use for memtables. This value is read from the DatabaseDescriptor and is shifted left by 20 to convert it from megabytes to bytes. This off-heap memory limit is then used in the creation of the MemtablePool.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The triggering frequency of the 'memtable_offheap_space_in_mb' configuration depends on the memtable_cleanup_threshold set in the DatabaseDescriptor. When the memtable_cleanup_threshold is reached, Cassandra will trigger a flush to clear the memtable and free up memory. The frequency of this triggering will depend on the rate of writes and the size of the memtables.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the 'memtable_offheap_space_in_mb' configuration option on the system is significant. Setting a higher value for this configuration will allow Cassandra to use more off-heap memory for memtables, potentially improving performance by reducing the frequency of flushes. However, setting a very high value could lead to increased memory usage and potential out-of-memory errors if not managed properly."
