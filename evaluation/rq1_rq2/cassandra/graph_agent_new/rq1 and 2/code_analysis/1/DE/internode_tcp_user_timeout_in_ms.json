The amount of time to wait for internode tcp connections to establish. internode_tcp_connect_timeout_in_ms: 2000  The amount of time unacknowledged data is allowed on a connection before we throw out the connection Note this is only supported on Linux + epoll, and it appears to behave oddly above a setting of 30000 (it takes much longer than 30s) as of Linux 4.12. If you want something that high set this to 0 which picks up the OS default and configure the net.ipv4.tcp_retries2 sysctl to be ~8.",
    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The configuration 'internode_tcp_user_timeout_in_ms' is used to set the amount of time to wait for internode TCP connections to establish in Cassandra. The code snippet provided shows that the 'tcpUserTimeoutInMS' method is used to determine the timeout value based on the connection category (messaging or streaming). If a specific timeout value is not set, it falls back to the values provided by 'DatabaseDescriptor.getInternodeTcpUserTimeoutInMS()' or 'DatabaseDescriptor.getInternodeStreamingTcpUserTimeoutInMS()'.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The triggering frequency of the 'internode_tcp_user_timeout_in_ms' configuration depends on the usage of internode TCP connections in the Cassandra system. The configuration is triggered whenever a new internode TCP connection is established, either for messaging or streaming purposes.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the 'internode_tcp_user_timeout_in_ms' configuration option is significant for protecting Cassandra from true network partitions. By setting an appropriate timeout value, the system can prevent potential issues caused by unacknowledged data on connections. It is crucial to configure this option correctly to ensure the stability and reliability of internode communication in Cassandra."
