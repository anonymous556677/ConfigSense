    "config_description": "Compression to apply to the commit log. If omitted, the commit log will be written uncompressed.  LZ4, Snappy, and Deflate compressors are supported.",
    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The commitlog_compression configuration is used to specify the compression algorithm to apply to the commit log. The code snippet shows that the configuration is used to create a new Configuration object with the specified compression algorithm (DatabaseDescriptor.getCommitLogCompression()). This configuration is then used when creating the CommitLog object.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The triggering frequency of the commitlog_compression configuration depends on when the CommitLog object is created. Typically, the CommitLog object is created when the system starts up or when a new commit log segment is needed. Therefore, the commitlog_compression configuration is triggered during these events.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the commitlog_compression configuration option on the system is related to the size of the commit log files. If compression is enabled, the commit log files will take up less disk space compared to uncompressed commit log files. However, there may be a slight increase in CPU usage due to the compression and decompression process during write and read operations."
