    "config_description": "Global, per-endpoint and per-connection limits imposed on messages queued for delivery to other nodes and waiting to be processed on arrival from other nodes in the cluster.  These limits are applied to the on-wire size of the message being sent or received.  The basic per-link limit is consumed in isolation before any endpoint or global limit is imposed. Each node-pair has three links: urgent, small and large.  So any given node may have a maximum of N*3*(internode_application_send_queue_capacity_in_bytes+internode_application_receive_queue_capacity_in_bytes) messages queued without any coordination between them although in practice, with token-aware routing, only RF*tokens nodes should need to communicate with significant bandwidth.  The per-endpoint limit is imposed on all messages exceeding the per-link limit, simultaneously with the global limit, on all links to or from a single node in the cluster. The global limit is imposed on all messages exceeding the per-link limit, simultaneously with the per-endpoint limit, on all links to or from any node in the cluster. ",
    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The configuration code retrieves the value of 'internode_application_send_queue_capacity_in_bytes' either from a local variable or from a method call to 'DatabaseDescriptor.getInternodeApplicationSendQueueCapacityInBytes()'. This value is used to set limits on the size of messages queued for delivery to other nodes and waiting to be processed on arrival from other nodes in the cluster.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The triggering frequency of the 'internode_application_send_queue_capacity_in_bytes' configuration depends on the message traffic between nodes in the cluster. Whenever messages are queued for delivery or processing, the configured limits are enforced.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The 'internode_application_send_queue_capacity_in_bytes' configuration option has a significant impact on the system's performance and resource utilization. Setting this value too low may result in message queue congestion and increased latency, while setting it too high may lead to excessive memory usage and potential out-of-memory errors. It is crucial to tune this configuration based on the expected message traffic and system resources."
