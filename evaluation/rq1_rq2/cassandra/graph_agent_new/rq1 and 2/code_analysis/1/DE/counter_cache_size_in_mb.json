In case of RF = 1 a counter cache hit will cause Cassandra to skip the read before write entirely. With RF > 1 a counter cache hit will still help to reduce the duration of the lock hold, helping with hot counter cell updates, but will not allow skipping the read entirely. Only the local (clock, count) tuple of a counter cell is kept in memory, not the whole counter, so it's relatively cheap.  NOTE: if you reduce the size, you may not get you hottest keys loaded on startup.  Default value is empty to make it \"auto\" (min(2.5% of Heap (in MB), 50MB)). Set to 0 to disable counter cache. NOTE: if you perform counter deletes and rely on low gcgs, you should disable the counter cache.",
    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The 'counter_cache_size_in_mb' configuration determines the maximum size of the counter cache in memory. The code initializes a counter cache with the specified capacity in MBs, creates a cache with the specified capacity using CaffeineCache, and schedules periodic cache saving based on the configured save period and keys to save.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The configuration is triggered whenever the counter cache is initialized or when the scheduled cache saving is executed based on the configured save period.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The 'counter_cache_size_in_mb' configuration impacts the memory usage of the system by allocating memory for the counter cache. A larger size can improve performance by reducing contention for hot counter cells and potentially skipping read operations, while a smaller size may not load all the hottest keys on startup. Disabling the counter cache can be beneficial if counter deletes are frequent and low gcgs are relied upon."
