    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The configuration 'batch_size_warn_threshold_in_kb' is used to set a threshold value for warning log messages when a multiple-partition batch size exceeds the specified value. The method getBatchSizeWarnThreshold() retrieves the value of this configuration from the DatabaseDescriptor.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The triggering frequency of the 'batch_size_warn_threshold_in_kb' configuration depends on the batch size of multiple-partition operations in the system. If the batch size exceeds the specified threshold, a warning log message will be triggered.",

However, caution should be taken as increasing this threshold too much can result in node instability due to larger batch sizes being processed."
