If disabled, replicas will assume that requests were forwarded to them instantly by the coordinator, which means that under overload conditions we will waste that much extra time processing already-timed-out requests.  Warning: It is generally assumed that users have setup NTP on their clusters, and that clocks are modestly in sync, since this is a requirement for general correctness of last write wins.",
    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The 'cross_node_timeout' configuration is checked in the 'getExpiresAtNanos' method to determine if operation timeout information exchange between nodes should be enabled. If the configuration is enabled and the createdAtNanos is greater than the currentTimeNanos, the createdAtNanos is set to the currentTimeNanos. The method then calculates and returns the expiration time by adding the expirationPeriodNanos to the createdAtNanos.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The triggering frequency of the 'cross_node_timeout' configuration depends on the usage of the 'getExpiresAtNanos' method in the system. If this method is called frequently in the system, then the 'cross_node_timeout' configuration will be checked and utilized accordingly.",

If the configuration is disabled, it may lead to wasted time processing already-timed-out requests under overload conditions. It is important for users to have NTP setup on their clusters and ensure clocks are in sync for the general correctness of last write wins."
