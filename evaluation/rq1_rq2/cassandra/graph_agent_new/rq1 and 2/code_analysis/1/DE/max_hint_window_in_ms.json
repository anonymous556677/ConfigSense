    "config_description": "this defines the maximum amount of time a dead host will have hints generated.  After it has been dead this long, new hints for it will not be created until it has been seen alive and gone down again.",
    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The configuration 'max_hint_window_in_ms' is used to define the maximum amount of time a dead host will have hints generated. The code snippet provided checks if the hint window for a dead host has expired before generating new hints for it.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The triggering frequency of the 'max_hint_window_in_ms' configuration depends on the downtime of the hosts in the system. The configuration is triggered whenever a dead host is checked for hint generation.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the 'max_hint_window_in_ms' configuration option is that it controls the time duration for which hints are generated for a dead host. Setting a higher value for this configuration may result in more hints being generated for dead hosts, potentially impacting the system's performance and resource utilization."
