    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The configuration 'stream_throughput_outbound_megabits_per_sec' controls the outbound stream throughput in megabits per second for all streaming file transfers between datacenters. The setStreamThroughputMbPerSec method sets the value of the configuration, the getStreamThroughputMbPerSec method retrieves the value, and the calculateRateInBytes method calculates the rate in bytes based on the configuration value.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The configuration is triggered whenever the setStreamThroughputMbPerSec method is called to update the value of the outbound stream throughput. The frequency of triggering depends on how often this method is invoked in the system.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the 'stream_throughput_outbound_megabits_per_sec' configuration option is significant as it throttles all streaming file transfer between datacenters. By setting a value for this configuration, users can control the inter-dc stream throughput and manage network stream traffic effectively. Setting a higher value may increase throughput but could potentially saturate the network, while setting a lower value may limit throughput but improve network stability."
