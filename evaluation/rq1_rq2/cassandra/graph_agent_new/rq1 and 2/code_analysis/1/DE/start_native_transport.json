If the property is set to true or if it is not set and the DatabaseDescriptor.startNativeTransport() method returns true, then the native transport server is started by calling the startNativeTransport() method.",

Starting the native transport server allows clients to connect to the system using the native protocol, which can have performance implications depending on the workload and configuration settings."
