The method getCDCSpaceInMB() retrieves this value from the configuration and is used in the allowableCDCBytes() method to calculate the allowable CDC bytes."

If space gets above this value, Cassandra will throw WriteTimeoutException on Mutations including tables with CDC enabled. A CDCCompactor is responsible for parsing the raw CDC logs and deleting them when parsing is completed.  The default value is the min of 4096 mb and 1/8th of the total space of the drive where cdc_raw_directory resides.",
    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The configuration code 'cdc_total_space_in_mb' is used to determine the total space available for change-data-capture logs on disk. It retrieves the value set for CDC space in MB from the DatabaseDescriptor and converts it to bytes by multiplying with 1024 * 1024.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The triggering frequency of the 'cdc_total_space_in_mb' configuration in the system depends on the usage of change-data-capture logs and the rate at which the space allocated for CDC logs is being filled. If the space allocated exceeds the specified limit, Cassandra will throw WriteTimeoutException on Mutations including tables with CDC enabled.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the 'cdc_total_space_in_mb' configuration option on the system is significant. If the allocated space for CDC logs exceeds the specified limit, it can lead to WriteTimeoutException on Mutations, affecting the performance and reliability of the system. It is crucial to monitor and manage the space allocated for CDC logs to avoid such issues."
