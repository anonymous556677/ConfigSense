    "config_description": "GC Pauses greater than gc_warn_threshold_in_ms will be logged at WARN level Adjust the threshold based on your application throughput requirement. Setting to 0 will deactivate the feature.",
    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The configuration 'gc_warn_threshold_in_ms' is used to set a threshold for logging GC pauses at WARN level. If the GC pauses exceed the specified threshold, a warning message will be logged. The threshold can be adjusted based on the application's throughput requirement, and setting it to 0 will deactivate the feature.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The configuration is triggered whenever a Garbage Collection event occurs and the pause time exceeds the specified threshold value of 'gc_warn_threshold_in_ms'. The frequency of triggering depends on the frequency and duration of GC events in the system.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the 'gc_warn_threshold_in_ms' configuration option is on the system's logging behavior. Setting a higher threshold may result in fewer warning messages being logged for GC pauses, while setting a lower threshold may increase the number of warning messages. This can affect the visibility and monitoring of GC performance in the system."
