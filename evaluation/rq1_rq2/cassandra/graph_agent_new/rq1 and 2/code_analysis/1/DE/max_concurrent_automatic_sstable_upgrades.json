    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The configuration 'max_concurrent_automatic_sstable_upgrades' controls the maximum number of concurrent sstable upgrades that can be automatically triggered in the system. The code snippet provided shows a method maybeRunUpgradeTask() which checks if there are upgrade tasks available and if the number of currently running background upgrades is less than or equal to the value specified by 'max_concurrent_automatic_sstable_upgrades'. If the condition is met, an upgrade task is executed.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The triggering frequency of the configuration 'max_concurrent_automatic_sstable_upgrades' depends on the availability of upgrade tasks and the current number of background upgrades running in the system. It is triggered whenever the maybeRunUpgradeTask() method is called and there are upgrade tasks available for execution.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the configuration option 'max_concurrent_automatic_sstable_upgrades' on the system is that it limits the number of concurrent sstable upgrades that can be automatically triggered. Setting a lower value for this configuration may result in slower upgrade processes, while setting a higher value may increase the system load and resource usage due to more concurrent upgrades."
