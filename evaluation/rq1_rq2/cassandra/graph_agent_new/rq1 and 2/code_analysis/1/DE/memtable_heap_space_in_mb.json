    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The configuration 'memtable_heap_space_in_mb' is used to set the total permitted memory to use for memtables in the Cassandra database.

    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The triggering frequency of the 'memtable_heap_space_in_mb' configuration in the system depends on the memtable_cleanup_threshold value set in the configuration. When the total memory used by memtables exceeds the limit specified in 'memtable_heap_space_in_mb', Cassandra will stop accepting writes until a flush completes. The frequency of triggering a flush is based on the memtable_cleanup_threshold value.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the 'memtable_heap_space_in_mb' configuration option on the system is significant. If the configured memory limit is too low, it can lead to frequent flushes and performance degradation as Cassandra stops accepting writes until a flush completes. On the other hand, setting a higher memory limit can improve performance but may also increase memory usage and potentially lead to out-of-memory errors if not managed properly."
