    "config_description": "Total space to use for commit logs on disk.  If space gets above this value, Cassandra will flush every dirty CF in the oldest segment and remove it.  So a small total commitlog space will tend to cause more flush activity on less-active columnfamilies.  The default value is the smaller of 8192, and 1/4 of the total space of the commitlog volume. ",
    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The configuration 'commitlog_total_space_in_mb' is used to determine the total space available for commit logs on disk. It is calculated by multiplying the value of 'DatabaseDescriptor.getTotalCommitlogSpaceInMB()' by 1024 * 1024. The 'unusedCapacity()' method then calculates the remaining unused space by subtracting the current size of the commit log from the total space.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The triggering frequency of the 'commitlog_total_space_in_mb' configuration depends on the rate at which the commit log size grows. When the commit log size approaches or exceeds the configured total space, Cassandra will trigger a flush operation to remove the oldest segment and make space for new entries. The frequency of this triggering event will vary based on the write activity and the size of the commit log.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the 'commitlog_total_space_in_mb' configuration on the system is significant. A smaller total commit log space will result in more frequent flush operations, especially for less-active column families. This can lead to increased disk I/O activity and potentially impact the overall performance of the system. It is important to configure this value appropriately based on the write workload and available disk space to ensure optimal system performance."
