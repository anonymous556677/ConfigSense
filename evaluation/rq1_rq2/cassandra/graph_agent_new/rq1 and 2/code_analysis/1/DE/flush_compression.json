As high ratio compressors like LZ4HC, Zstd, and Deflate can potentially block flushes for too long, the default is to flush with a known fast compressor in those cases. Options are:  none : Flush without compressing blocks but while still doing checksums. fast : Flush with a fast compressor. If the table is already using a fast compressor that compressor is used. table: Always flush with the same compressor that the table uses. This was the pre 4.0 behavior. ",

The code snippet provided checks the operation type and selects the appropriate compression parameters based on the configured flush compression option.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The triggering frequency of the 'flush_compression' configuration depends on the frequency of flushing SSTables in the system. It is triggered whenever a flush operation is performed on a memtable, especially for large tables that can potentially block writes.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the 'flush_compression' configuration option is significant as it affects the throughput of the compressor during flush operations. Choosing a high ratio compressor like LZ4HC, Zstd, or Deflate can potentially block flushes for too long, hence the default behavior is to use a fast compressor in those cases to prevent blocking. The configuration option allows for flexibility in choosing the compression strategy based on the table's requirements."
