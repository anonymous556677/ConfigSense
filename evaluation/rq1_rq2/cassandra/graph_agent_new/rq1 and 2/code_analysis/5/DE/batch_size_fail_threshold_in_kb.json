    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The configuration 'batch_size_fail_threshold_in_kb' is used to determine the threshold at which a multiple-partition batch will fail. It is retrieved using the method getBatchSizeFailureThreshold() which internally calls DatabaseDescriptor.getBatchSizeFailThresholdInKB().",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The configuration is triggered whenever a multiple-partition batch is being processed and the size of the batch exceeds the specified threshold. The frequency of triggering depends on the number of batches processed and their sizes.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the 'batch_size_fail_threshold_in_kb' configuration option is significant as it directly affects the reliability and performance of the system. Setting a lower threshold may result in more batches failing, leading to potential performance degradation, while setting a higher threshold may allow larger batches to be processed but may increase the risk of failures due to the size of the batch."
