The code checks if the number of unique partition keys in the batch exceeds the configured threshold and logs a warning if it does.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The configuration is triggered whenever the 'verifyBatchType' method is called with a collection of mutations. The frequency of triggering depends on how often batch operations are performed in the system and how many partitions each batch spans across.",

This can help in monitoring and troubleshooting performance issues related to batch operations in the system."
