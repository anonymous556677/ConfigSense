    "config_description": "Maximum size of the key cache in memory.  Each key cache hit saves 1 seek and each row cache hit saves 2 seeks at the minimum, sometimes more. The key cache is fairly tiny for the amount of time it saves, so it's worthwhile to use it at large numbers. The row cache saves even more time, but must contain the entire row, so it is extremely space-intensive. It's best to only use the row cache if you have hot rows or static rows.  NOTE: if you reduce the size, you may not get you hottest keys loaded on startup.  Default value is empty to make it \"auto\" (min(5% of Heap (in MB), 100MB)). Set to 0 to disable key cache.",
    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The 'key_cache_size_in_mb' configuration is used to set the maximum size of the key cache in memory. The code initializes the key cache with the specified capacity in MBs and creates an AutoSavingCache object with the key cache.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The configuration is triggered whenever the 'initKeyCache' method is called to initialize the key cache. The frequency of triggering depends on how often this method is invoked in the system.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the 'key_cache_size_in_mb' configuration option is significant as it determines the amount of memory allocated for the key cache. A larger size can improve performance by reducing seek times for cache hits, but it can also consume more memory. On the other hand, a smaller size may save memory but could result in not loading the hottest keys on startup. It's important to find a balance based on the system's requirements."
