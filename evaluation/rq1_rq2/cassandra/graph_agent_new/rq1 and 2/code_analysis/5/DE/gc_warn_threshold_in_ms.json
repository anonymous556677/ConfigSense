    "config_description": "GC Pauses greater than gc_warn_threshold_in_ms will be logged at WARN level Adjust the threshold based on your application throughput requirement. Setting to 0 will deactivate the feature.",
    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The gc_warn_threshold_in_ms configuration is used to set a threshold for logging GC pauses at WARN level. If the GC pauses exceed the threshold, they will be logged at the WARN level. This allows developers to adjust the threshold based on the application's throughput requirements. Setting the threshold to 0 will deactivate this feature.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The triggering frequency of the gc_warn_threshold_in_ms configuration depends on the frequency of GC pauses exceeding the threshold set. If the GC pauses exceed the configured threshold, they will be logged at the WARN level.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the gc_warn_threshold_in_ms configuration option is that it affects the logging level of GC pauses. Setting a higher threshold may result in fewer logs being generated for GC pauses, while setting a lower threshold may result in more logs being generated. This can impact the system's performance and the amount of information available for troubleshooting GC-related issues."
