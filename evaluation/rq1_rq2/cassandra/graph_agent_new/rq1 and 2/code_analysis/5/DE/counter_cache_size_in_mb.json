In case of RF = 1 a counter cache hit will cause Cassandra to skip the read before write entirely. With RF > 1 a counter cache hit will still help to reduce the duration of the lock hold, helping with hot counter cell updates, but will not allow skipping the read entirely. Only the local (clock, count) tuple of a counter cell is kept in memory, not the whole counter, so it's relatively cheap.  NOTE: if you reduce the size, you may not get you hottest keys loaded on startup.  Default value is empty to make it \"auto\" (min(2.5% of Heap (in MB), 50MB)). Set to 0 to disable counter cache. NOTE: if you perform counter deletes and rely on low gcgs, you should disable the counter cache.",

Setting a larger size can improve performance by reducing contention for hot counter cells and potentially skipping read operations. However, setting a smaller size may result in not loading the hottest keys on startup and could impact performance negatively. Disabling the counter cache entirely may be necessary in certain scenarios, such as when performing counter deletes and relying on low gcgs."
