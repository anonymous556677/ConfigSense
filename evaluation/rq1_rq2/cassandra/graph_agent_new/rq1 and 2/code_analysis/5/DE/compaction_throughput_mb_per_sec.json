    "config_description": "Throttles compaction to the given total throughput across the entire system. The faster you insert data, the faster you need to compact in order to keep the sstable count down, but in general, setting this to 16 to 32 times the rate you are inserting data is more than sufficient. Setting this to 0 disables throttling. Note that this accounts for all types of compaction, including validation compaction (building Merkle trees for repairs).",
    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The configuration 'compaction_throughput_mb_per_sec' is used to throttle compaction to a specific throughput limit across the entire system. The rate limiter is set based on the value of 'compactionThroughputMbPerSec' obtained from 'DatabaseDescriptor.getCompactionThroughputMbPerSec()'.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The triggering frequency of the 'compaction_throughput_mb_per_sec' configuration depends on the rate at which data is inserted into the system. The configuration is typically triggered whenever compaction needs to be throttled to maintain a desired throughput limit.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the 'compaction_throughput_mb_per_sec' configuration option is significant as it directly affects the speed and efficiency of compaction processes in the system. Setting the value too low may result in slower compaction and potentially higher sstable counts, while setting it too high may lead to unnecessary throttling and resource wastage."
