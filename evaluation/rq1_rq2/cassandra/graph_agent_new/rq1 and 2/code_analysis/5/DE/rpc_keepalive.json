    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The rpc_keepalive configuration is used to enable or disable keepalive on rpc/native connections. In the code snippet provided, the configuration is used to set up the pipeline configurator with the DatabaseDescriptor.getRpcKeepAlive() value.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The triggering frequency of the rpc_keepalive configuration depends on the specific use case and system setup. It is typically triggered during the initialization of the Server class when setting up the pipeline configurator.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "Enabling or disabling keepalive on rpc/native connections can impact the system's performance and resource usage. Keepalive can help in maintaining persistent connections and reducing connection setup overhead, but it may also consume additional resources. The impact of this configuration option should be carefully considered based on the specific system requirements and constraints."
