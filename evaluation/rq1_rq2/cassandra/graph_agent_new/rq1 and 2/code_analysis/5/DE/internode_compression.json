    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The configuration 'internode_compression' is used in the code to determine whether traffic between nodes should be compressed. It checks if the internode compression setting in the DatabaseDescriptor is set to 'all' or 'dc' and if the hosts are in the same datacenter.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The triggering frequency of the 'internode_compression' configuration in the system depends on the traffic between nodes and the configuration setting. If there is frequent communication between nodes, the configuration will be triggered more often.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the 'internode_compression' configuration option on the system is significant. If all traffic is compressed, it can reduce network bandwidth usage but may increase CPU usage for compression and decompression. If only traffic between datacenters is compressed, it can still provide some network bandwidth savings while reducing the CPU overhead compared to compressing all traffic."
