    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The configuration 'commit_failure_policy' is used to determine the action to take when there is a commit error. The code checks the value of 'commit_failure_policy' from the DatabaseDescriptor and performs different actions based on the policy set.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The triggering frequency of the 'commit_failure_policy' configuration depends on the occurrence of commit errors in the system. Whenever there is a commit error, the 'handleCommitError' method is called to handle the error based on the configured policy.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the 'commit_failure_policy' configuration option on the system is significant. Depending on the policy set, it can result in shutting down the node, killing the JVM, stopping the commit log, or ignoring fatal errors. These actions can have a direct impact on the availability and reliability of the system."
