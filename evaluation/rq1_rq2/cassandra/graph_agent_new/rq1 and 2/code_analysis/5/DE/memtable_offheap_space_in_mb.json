    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The triggering frequency of the 'memtable_offheap_space_in_mb' configuration depends on the memtable_cleanup_threshold set in the configuration. When the memtable size exceeds the cleanup threshold, a flush is triggered to free up memory. The frequency of this triggering depends on the rate of writes and the size of memtables in the system.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the 'memtable_offheap_space_in_mb' configuration option on the system is significant. Setting this value too low can lead to frequent flushes and performance degradation as Cassandra stops accepting writes until a flush completes. On the other hand, setting it too high can lead to excessive memory usage and potential out-of-memory errors. It is crucial to tune this configuration based on the workload and available system resources to achieve optimal performance."
