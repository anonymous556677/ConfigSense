    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The configuration 'max_hint_window_in_ms' is used to define the maximum amount of time a dead host will have hints generated. If a dead host has been down longer than the specified time, new hints for it will not be created until it has been seen alive and gone down again.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The configuration is triggered whenever the system checks if a hint window has expired for a dead host. This check is performed when the system is determining whether to generate new hints for a dead host or not.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the 'max_hint_window_in_ms' configuration option is that it affects the generation of hints for dead hosts in the system. Setting a higher value for this configuration will result in hints being generated for dead hosts for a longer period of time, potentially increasing the load on the system. On the other hand, setting a lower value may lead to hints not being generated for dead hosts promptly, which could impact data consistency and availability."
