    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The configuration 'hinted_handoff_enabled' is used to determine if hinted handoff is enabled globally in the system. The method getHintedHandoffEnabled() returns the value of DatabaseDescriptor.hintedHandoffEnabled() which indicates whether hinted handoff is enabled or not.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The configuration is triggered whenever the shouldHint() method is called, which typically happens when a replica is being checked for hinting. The frequency of triggering depends on the number of replicas being checked for hinting.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "Enabling or disabling hinted handoff can impact the system's performance and reliability. If hinted handoff is disabled, replicas may not receive hints for missed writes, potentially leading to data inconsistency. On the other hand, enabling hinted handoff can increase the load on the system as it needs to manage and deliver hints to replicas."
