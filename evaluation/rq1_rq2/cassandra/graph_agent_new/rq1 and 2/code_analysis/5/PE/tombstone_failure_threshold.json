    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'tombstone_failure_threshold' is not performance-sensitive. The code context related to the configuration does not involve any performance-sensitive operations that significantly impact system performance at the system level. The configuration is used to retrieve the tombstone failure threshold from the DatabaseDescriptor, which is a static value and does not directly contribute to time-expensive or memory-expensive operations."
