    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option cdc_total_space_in_mb is performance-sensitive. The code context shows that the value of cdc_total_space_in_mb is being multiplied by 1024 * 1024 in the method allowableCDCBytes(). This indicates that the configuration directly affects the amount of space allocated for change-data-capture logs, which can have a significant impact on system performance in terms of memory consumption. Additionally, the unclear method getCDCSpaceInMB() retrieves this configuration value, further emphasizing its importance in performance considerations."
