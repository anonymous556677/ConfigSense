{
    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'internode_application_send_queue_capacity_in_bytes' is performance-sensitive. This is because the method 'applicationSendQueueCapacityInBytes' directly retrieves the value of the configuration parameter 'internode_application_send_queue_capacity_in_bytes' and uses it to determine the application send queue capacity in bytes. This configuration directly impacts the capacity for messages queued for delivery to other nodes in the cluster, which can have a significant performance impact at the system level. Additionally, the method 'getInternodeApplicationSendQueueCapacityInBytes' is related to this configuration parameter, further indicating its performance sensitivity."
