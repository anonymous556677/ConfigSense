    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'internode_application_receive_queue_capacity_in_bytes' is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the 'applicationReceiveQueueCapacityInBytes' configuration directly affects the capacity of the application receive queue, which is a critical component in handling inbound messages in the MessagingService. The code snippet shows that this configuration parameter is checked against a minimum value and is used in the creation of 'InboundConnectionSettings'. This indicates that the 'applicationReceiveQueueCapacityInBytes' configuration has a direct and substantial impact on the system performance at the MessagingService level, making it performance-sensitive."
