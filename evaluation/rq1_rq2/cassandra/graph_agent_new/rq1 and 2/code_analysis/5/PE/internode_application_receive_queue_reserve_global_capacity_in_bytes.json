    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'internode_application_receive_queue_reserve_global_capacity_in_bytes' is classified as not performance-sensitive. The code context provided does not contain any performance-related operations that are time-expensive or memory-expensive. The method 'scheduleUnusedConnectionMonitoring' mentioned in the code snippet does not provide any direct evidence of performance impact related to the configuration. Therefore, based on the code context alone, the configuration is not considered performance-sensitive."
