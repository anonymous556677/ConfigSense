    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'allocate_tokens_for_keyspace' is performance-sensitive. This is because the 'allocateTokens' method within the code context directly affects system performance by allocating tokens based on the keyspace and replication factor specified in the configuration. The allocation of tokens is a time-expensive operation that can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Additionally, the code context mentions handling of schema wait delays and replication strategies, which further indicates the performance sensitivity of the configuration."
