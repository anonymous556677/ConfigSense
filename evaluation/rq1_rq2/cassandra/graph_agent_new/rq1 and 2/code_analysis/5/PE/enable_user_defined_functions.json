    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'enable_user_defined_functions' is performance-sensitive. This is because the 'assertUdfsEnabled' method checks if user-defined functions are enabled in the cassandra.yaml configuration file. If user-defined functions are disabled, an exception is thrown, which can impact the performance of the system. This configuration directly affects system performance by enabling or disabling a feature that can have a notable impact on execution time and memory consumption."
