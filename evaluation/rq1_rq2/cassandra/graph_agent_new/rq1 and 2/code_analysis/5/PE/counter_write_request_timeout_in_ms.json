{
    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'counter_write_request_timeout_in_ms' is classified as performance-sensitive. This is because the 'counter_write_request_timeout_in_ms' configuration directly affects the timeout values for counter write requests at the system level, which can have a notable impact on system performance. The code context provided shows that this configuration is used in multiple methods to retrieve and set timeout values for counter write requests, which are time-expensive operations. These operations directly impact the execution time of counter write requests, making the configuration performance-sensitive."
