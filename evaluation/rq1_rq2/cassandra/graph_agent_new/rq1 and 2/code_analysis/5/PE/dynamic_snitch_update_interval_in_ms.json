    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'dynamic_snitch_update_interval_in_ms' is performance-sensitive. This is because the 'dynamicUpdateInterval' and 'dynamicResetInterval' values directly impact the scheduling of tasks that involve time-expensive operations like updating scores and resetting bad hosts. These tasks are executed at fixed intervals and can significantly affect system performance. Additionally, changes in these intervals are monitored and applied dynamically, showing that the configuration has a direct and substantial impact on system performance at the system level."
