    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'concurrent_materialized_view_builders' is performance-sensitive. The configuration directly affects the number of concurrent view builders, which can impact system performance by controlling the parallelism of materialized view builder tasks. The code context includes methods like 'getConcurrentViewBuilders' and 'setConcurrentViewBuilders' which interact with this configuration, indicating its importance in managing system performance."
