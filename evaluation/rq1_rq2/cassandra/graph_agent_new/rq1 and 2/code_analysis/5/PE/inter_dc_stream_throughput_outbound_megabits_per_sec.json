{
    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'inter_dc_stream_throughput_outbound_megabits_per_sec' is classified as performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly affects the inter-DC stream throughput in megabits per second, which can have a substantial impact on system performance at the system level. The code context provided shows that the configuration is used to calculate the inter-DC rate in bytes, which involves time-expensive operations like multiplication and conditional checks based on the throughput value. These operations can lead to notable performance variations, making the configuration performance-sensitive."
