    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'tombstone_warn_threshold' is not performance-sensitive. The code context related to the configuration does not contain any performance-sensitive operations that would lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The configuration is a simple getter method that retrieves the 'tombstone_warn_threshold' value from the DatabaseDescriptor, which is a constant configuration value. This method does not involve any time-expensive or memory-expensive operations that would impact system performance significantly."
