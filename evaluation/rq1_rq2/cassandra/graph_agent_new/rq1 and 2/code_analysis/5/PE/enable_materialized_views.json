    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'enable_materialized_views' is performance-sensitive. The code context provided contains multiple performance-related operations that contribute to execution time and memory consumption. The configuration directly affects system performance at the system level by validating and processing various aspects of materialized views creation. Operations such as dependency validations, processing SELECT clause, processing PRIMARY KEY columns, and WHERE clause involve time-expensive and memory-expensive operations that can lead to notable performance variations. Therefore, based on the code analysis, the configuration is classified as performance-sensitive."
