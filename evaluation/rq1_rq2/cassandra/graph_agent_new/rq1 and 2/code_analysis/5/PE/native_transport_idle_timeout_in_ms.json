    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option native_transport_idle_timeout_in_ms is performance-sensitive. The idleTimeout value obtained from this configuration directly affects the idle time for client connections, leading to potential performance impacts at the system level. The code snippet related to this configuration adds an IdleStateHandler to the channel pipeline, which closes client connections after a specified idle timeout. This operation can be time-expensive and memory-expensive, especially when handling a large number of client connections, resulting in notable performance variations."
