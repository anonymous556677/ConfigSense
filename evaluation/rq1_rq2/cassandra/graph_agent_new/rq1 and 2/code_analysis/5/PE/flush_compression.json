    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'flush_compression' is performance-sensitive. The code snippet provided shows that the 'flush_compression' configuration directly impacts the choice of compression algorithm used during the flushing of memtables. This choice of compression algorithm can have a significant impact on system performance, especially for large tables where flushes can queue up and potentially block writes. The code snippet also mentions the importance of throughput of the compressor during flushes, indicating that the choice of compression algorithm is crucial for system performance. Therefore, the 'flush_compression' configuration involves performance-related operations that are time-extensive and memory-extensive, leading to notable performance variations at the system level."
