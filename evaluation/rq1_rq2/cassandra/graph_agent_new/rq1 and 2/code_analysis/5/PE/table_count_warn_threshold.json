    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'table_count_warn_threshold' is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the 'table_count_warn_threshold' configuration directly impacts the system performance by determining when a client warning should be sent based on the number of tables/keyspaces in the cluster exceeding certain thresholds. This configuration involves performance-related operations such as checking the table count and comparing it with the threshold value, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
