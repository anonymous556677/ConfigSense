{
    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'index_summary_capacity_in_mb' is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the memory pool size for SSTable index summaries, which can have a significant effect on system performance. The code context shows that the configuration value is used to set the memory pool capacity and resize interval, indicating that changes to this configuration can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Additionally, the method getIndexSummaryCapacityInMB() retrieves the value of 'indexSummaryCapacityInMB' from the configuration, further emphasizing its importance in system performance."
