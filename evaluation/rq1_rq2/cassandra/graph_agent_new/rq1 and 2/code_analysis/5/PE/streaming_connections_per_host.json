    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'streaming_connections_per_host' is performance-sensitive. This is because the 'streaming_connections_per_host' configuration directly affects the number of streaming connections allowed per host, which can have a significant impact on the performance of the streaming process. The code context shows that this configuration parameter is used in the 'bootstrap' and 'rebuild' methods, which are critical operations for data streaming and rebuilding in the system. Adjusting the 'streaming_connections_per_host' value can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, making it a performance-sensitive configuration."
