    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'snapshot_links_per_second' is classified as performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the 'snapshot_links_per_second' configuration directly affects the rate at which snapshots are created or cleared, which can have a significant impact on system performance. The code context shows that this configuration is used to create a RateLimiter, which indicates that it is time-sensitive and can lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
