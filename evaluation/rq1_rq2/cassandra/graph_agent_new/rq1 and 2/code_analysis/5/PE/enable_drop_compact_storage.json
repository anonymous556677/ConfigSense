    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'enable_drop_compact_storage' is performance-sensitive. The code context shows that this configuration controls the ability to use 'ALTER ... DROP COMPACT STORAGE' statements, which can have a notable impact on system performance. The method 'enableDropCompactStorage' directly accesses this configuration parameter, indicating its importance in determining system behavior. Additionally, the code snippet related to this configuration includes operations that validate and set flags for table storage, which are time-expensive and memory-expensive operations contributing to notable performance variations at the system level."
