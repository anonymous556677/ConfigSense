    "classification_result": "Performance-insensitive with 100% confidence",
    "Reason": "The partitioner configuration option is related to distributing rows across nodes in the cluster based on a partition key. Changing the partitioner does not directly impact system performance, but rather affects data distribution and compatibility. It is not a time-dependent aspect of system operation and does not involve performance-related operations."
