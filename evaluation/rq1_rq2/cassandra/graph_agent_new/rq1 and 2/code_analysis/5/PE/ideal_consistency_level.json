{
    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'ideal_consistency_level' is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the 'ideal_consistency_level' configuration directly affects the performance of the system at the system level. The 'ideal_consistency_level' configuration involves performance-related operations that are time-extensive within its related code. The 'getWriteResponseHandler' method uses the 'ideal_consistency_level' configuration to determine the consistency level for write response handling, which can have a notable performance impact on the system. Therefore, based on the code context and the significance of the configuration in performance-related operations, it is classified as performance-sensitive."
