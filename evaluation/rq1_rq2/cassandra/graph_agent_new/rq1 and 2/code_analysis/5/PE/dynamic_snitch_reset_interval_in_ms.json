    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'dynamic_snitch_reset_interval_in_ms' is performance-sensitive. This is because the 'dynamicResetInterval' parameter directly affects the scheduling of tasks that involve time-expensive operations. The code snippet shows that the 'dynamicResetInterval' is used to schedule tasks with fixed delays, which can have a notable impact on system performance. Changing this interval can lead to significant performance variations at the system level, making it a performance-sensitive configuration."
