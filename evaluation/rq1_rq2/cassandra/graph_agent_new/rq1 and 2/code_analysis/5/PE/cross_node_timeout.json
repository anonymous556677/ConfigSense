    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'cross_node_timeout' is classified as performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the 'hasCrossNodeTimeout' method directly checks the 'cross_node_timeout' configuration parameter to determine if cross-node timeout is enabled. This configuration directly affects the operation timeout information exchange between nodes, which can have a notable impact on system performance at the system level. Additionally, the code context shows that the 'createdAtNanos' value is adjusted based on the 'cross_node_timeout' configuration, indicating that this configuration can lead to notable performance variations in the system."
