    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'counter_cache_size_in_mb' is classified as performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the 'counter_cache_size_in_mb' configuration directly impacts the capacity of the counter cache in memory, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The code context shows that the configuration value is used to calculate the cache capacity and initialize the counter cache, which are time-expensive operations. Therefore, any changes in the 'counter_cache_size_in_mb' configuration can have a significant impact on system performance."
