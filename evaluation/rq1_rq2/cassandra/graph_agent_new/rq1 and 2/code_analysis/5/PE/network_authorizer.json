    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'network_authorizer' configuration is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the 'network_authorizer' configuration involves operations that are time-expensive and memory-expensive within its related code. Specifically, the 'hasLocalAccess()' method in the 'AuthenticatedUser' class makes a call to 'networkAuthCache.get()' which can have a notable performance impact at the system level. This method involves checking whether the user has access to nodes in the local datacenter, which can be a time-consuming operation depending on the size and complexity of the network authorization logic. Therefore, the configuration is considered performance-sensitive based on the presence of such performance-related operations within its code context."
