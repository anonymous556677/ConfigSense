    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'index_summary_resize_interval_in_minutes' is performance-sensitive. The code context provided shows that this configuration setting is used to determine the interval for resampling index summaries, which can directly impact the performance of the system. Resampling index summaries at a frequent interval can be time-expensive and memory-expensive, leading to notable performance variations at the system level. Additionally, the code snippet in the constructor initializes the IndexSummaryManager with the specified resize interval, indicating the importance of this configuration setting in managing system performance."
