    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'internode_application_receive_queue_reserve_endpoint_capacity_in_bytes' is performance-sensitive. This is because it directly affects the capacity of the internode application receive queue at the system level, which impacts the handling of inbound messages. The code context reveals that this configuration is used to set the endpoint capacity for the application receive queue, which is crucial for managing message delivery and processing. Therefore, any changes to this configuration can lead to notable performance variations in terms of message processing and system responsiveness."
