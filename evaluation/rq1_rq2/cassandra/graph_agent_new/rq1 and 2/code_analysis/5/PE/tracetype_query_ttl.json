    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'tracetype_query_ttl' is performance-sensitive. The 'Tracing' class contains methods that handle tracing sessions, including 'newSession', 'stopSession', 'initializeFromMessage', and 'traceOutgoingMessage', which involve time-expensive operations like UUID generation, session management, and message tracing. These operations directly impact system performance at the system level by adding overhead to query tracing and message handling processes. Additionally, the 'Tracing.TraceType' enum includes TTL values that can affect memory consumption, further contributing to notable performance variations."
