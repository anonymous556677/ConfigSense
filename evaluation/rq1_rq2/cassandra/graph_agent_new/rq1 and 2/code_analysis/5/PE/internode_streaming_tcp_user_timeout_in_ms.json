    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'internode_streaming_tcp_user_timeout_in_ms' is performance-sensitive. This is because the 'internode_streaming_tcp_user_timeout_in_ms' configuration directly affects the timeout for processing incoming stream messages in the 'receive' method. The 'internode_streaming_tcp_user_timeout_in_ms' value is compared with the latency of processing the incoming stream message, and if the latency exceeds the timeout value, a warning is logged. This configuration involves time-expensive operations that can significantly impact system performance at the system level, making it performance-sensitive."
