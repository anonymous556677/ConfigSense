    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'native_transport_flush_in_batches_legacy' is performance-sensitive. The code context reveals that this configuration parameter is used in the method 'useNativeTransportLegacyFlusher()' to determine whether to use native transport TCP message coalescing. This directly impacts the performance and throughput of the system by affecting how network messages are handled. Since network operations are typically time-expensive and can significantly impact system performance, any changes to this configuration can lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
