    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'num_tokens' is performance-sensitive. The code snippet related to the 'num_tokens' configuration involves operations that directly impact system performance, such as checking the number of tokens, validating replication factor, and joining the token ring. These operations are time-expensive and memory-expensive, leading to notable performance variations at the system level. Additionally, the configuration directly affects the behavior of the system in terms of replication and token allocation, making it crucial for system performance."
