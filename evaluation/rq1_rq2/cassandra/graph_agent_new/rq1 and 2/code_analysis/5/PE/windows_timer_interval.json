    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'windows_timer_interval' is performance-sensitive. The code context provided shows that the configuration directly affects the system performance by adjusting the system timer on Windows. This adjustment impacts timer intervals, thread scheduling, driver interrupts, etc., which are time-expensive operations. The method 'getWindowsTimerInterval' retrieves the value of the Windows timer interval from the configuration, indicating that this configuration setting is directly related to performance-related operations. Therefore, the configuration is considered performance-sensitive as it leads to notable performance variations at the system level."
