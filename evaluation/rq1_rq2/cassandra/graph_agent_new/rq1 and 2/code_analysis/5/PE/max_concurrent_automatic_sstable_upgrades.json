    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'max_concurrent_automatic_sstable_upgrades' is performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly affects the maximum number of concurrent automatic sstable upgrades, which can have a substantial impact on system performance. The code context shows that this configuration is used to limit the number of upgrade tasks that can run concurrently, which can significantly affect the execution time and memory consumption of the system. Therefore, any changes to this configuration can lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
