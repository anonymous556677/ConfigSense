    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'memtable_offheap_space_in_mb' is performance-sensitive. This is because the value of 'memtable_offheap_space_in_mb' directly influences the off-heap memory limit for memtables in the system. The 'offHeapLimit' calculated using this configuration parameter in the 'createMemtableAllocatorPool' method affects the memory consumption of the system, which can have a significant impact on performance at the system level. Therefore, any changes to 'memtable_offheap_space_in_mb' can lead to notable performance variations, making it a performance-sensitive configuration."
