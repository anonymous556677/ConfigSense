    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'inter_dc_tcp_nodelay' is classified as performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the 'tcpNoDelay' method directly impacts the performance of inter-dc communication by enabling or disabling TCP_NODELAY based on whether the hosts are in the same datacenter. This configuration-related code snippet involves performance-related operations that can significantly affect system performance at the system level, leading to notable performance variations."
