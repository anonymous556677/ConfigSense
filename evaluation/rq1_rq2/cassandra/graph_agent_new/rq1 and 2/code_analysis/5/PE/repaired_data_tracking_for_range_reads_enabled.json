    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'repaired_data_tracking_for_range_reads_enabled' is performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly affects the behavior of the 'query' method, which is a performance-related operation. The 'query' method involves multiple read operations and data processing steps that can be time-expensive and memory-expensive. Additionally, the configuration setting is used to determine whether to track repaired data for range reads, which can have a significant impact on the performance of read operations at the system level. Therefore, the configuration is considered performance-sensitive based on its direct influence on performance-related operations and potential notable performance variations."
