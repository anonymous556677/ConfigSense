    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'auto_snapshot' is performance-sensitive. The 'auto_snapshot' configuration directly impacts the system performance by determining whether a snapshot is taken before truncation or dropping of column families. This decision affects data safety and the efficiency of the system. The code related to the 'auto_snapshot' configuration involves time-expensive operations such as flushing memtables, truncating data, and saving truncation records, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Therefore, the configuration is considered performance-sensitive based on the significant performance impact it has on the system."
