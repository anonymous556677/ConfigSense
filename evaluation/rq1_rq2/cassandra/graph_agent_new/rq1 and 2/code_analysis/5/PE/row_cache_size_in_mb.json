    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'row_cache_size_in_mb' is performance-sensitive. The code context provided shows that the 'row_cache_size_in_mb' configuration directly affects the capacity of the row cache in memory, which can have a significant impact on system performance. The code snippets demonstrate that the value of 'row_cache_size_in_mb' is used to set the capacity of the cache, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level based on the memory consumption. Additionally, the method 'getRowCacheSizeInMB' directly retrieves this configuration value, indicating its importance in determining system performance."
