    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'native_transport_max_frame_size_in_mb' is performance-sensitive. This is because the 'decode' method in the code context involves operations that directly impact system performance at the system level. The method handles the decoding of message envelopes, which includes processing headers and bodies of messages. These operations are time-expensive and memory-expensive, as they involve reading and manipulating byte buffers, checking protocol versions, decoding flags, and handling compressed messages. These operations can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, making the configuration performance-sensitive."
