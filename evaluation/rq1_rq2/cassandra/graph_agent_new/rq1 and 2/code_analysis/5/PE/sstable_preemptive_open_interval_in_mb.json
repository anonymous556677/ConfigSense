    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'sstable_preemptive_open_interval_in_mb' is performance-sensitive. The code context shows that this configuration directly affects the calculation of the open interval in the 'calculateOpenInterval' method, which is a performance-related operation. The value of this configuration is multiplied by a large number (1L << 20) and used in a conditional check that can potentially set the interval to Long.MAX_VALUE. This configuration has a direct and substantial impact on system performance at the system level, making it performance-sensitive."
