    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'full_query_logging_options' is performance-sensitive. The code context provided includes operations that involve copying multiple fields from one object to another, which can be time-expensive. Additionally, the configuration directly affects the behavior of the FullQueryLogger, which can have a notable impact on system performance at the system level. Therefore, based on the code context and the provided information, the configuration is classified as performance-sensitive."
