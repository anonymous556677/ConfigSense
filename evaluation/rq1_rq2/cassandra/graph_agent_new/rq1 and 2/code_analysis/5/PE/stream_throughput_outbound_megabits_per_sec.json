    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'stream_throughput_outbound_megabits_per_sec' is classified as performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly affects the stream throughput outbound in megabits per second, which can have a substantial impact on system performance. The code context provided shows that changing the value of this configuration triggers the update of the stream throughput and rate limiter, indicating that it involves performance-related operations that are time-expensive. Additionally, the method 'calculateRateInBytes' calculates the rate in bytes based on the configured throughput, further emphasizing the performance sensitivity of this configuration."
