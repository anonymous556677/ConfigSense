{
    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'concurrent_compactors' is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the 'concurrent_compactors' configuration directly affects the system's performance by controlling the number of simultaneous compactions allowed, which can impact read performance in a mixed read/write workload. The code context shows that the 'getConcurrentCompactors' method is retrieving the value of 'conf.concurrent_compactors', indicating that this configuration is directly related to managing compaction operations, which are time-expensive and memory-expensive operations that can significantly impact system performance."
