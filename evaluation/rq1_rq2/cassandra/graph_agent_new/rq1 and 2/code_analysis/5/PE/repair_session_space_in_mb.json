{
    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'repair_session_space_in_mb' is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the configuration directly affects the amount of space allocated for creating Merkle trees during the validation process. The 'repair_session_space_in_mb' configuration value is used to calculate the available space in bytes for holding RF trees in memory, which can significantly impact the memory consumption and execution time of the system. The code snippet shows that the configuration value is multiplied by 1048576 to convert megabytes to bytes and then divided by the replication factor to determine the available space. This calculation directly influences the memory usage of the system and can lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
