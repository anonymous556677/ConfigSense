    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'audit_logging_options' configuration is performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly affects the system performance by enabling audit logging and setting various options related to audit logging. The code snippets related to this configuration involve operations that contribute to execution time and memory consumption, such as setting log paths, roll cycles, blocking behavior, and maximum queue weight. These operations can have a notable performance impact at the system level, making the configuration performance-sensitive."
