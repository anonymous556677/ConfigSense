{
    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'client_encryption_options' is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the 'SSLFactory' class contains methods that create SSL contexts and handle SSL connections, which involve time-expensive and memory-expensive operations. For example, creating Netty SslContext instances is mentioned to be expensive in terms of resource consumption. Additionally, the 'SSLFactory' class caches SSL contexts and performs periodic checks for hot reloading SSL certificates, which can impact system performance significantly. Therefore, the configuration directly and substantially affects system performance at the system level."
