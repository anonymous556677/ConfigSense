    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'file_cache_size_in_mb' is performance-sensitive. The 'file_cache_size_in_mb' configuration directly affects the cacheSize calculation in the ChunkCache class, which is a critical component for caching chunks and buffers. The cacheSize calculation is used to determine the maximum weight for the cache, impacting memory consumption. Additionally, the enabled flag in the ChunkCache class depends on the 'file_cache_size_in_mb' configuration value, affecting the creation of the ChunkCache instance. These factors indicate that changes in 'file_cache_size_in_mb' can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, making it performance-sensitive."
