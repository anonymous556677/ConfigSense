    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'enable_sasi_indexes' is not performance-sensitive based on the provided code context. The code snippet does not contain any performance-related operations that are time-expensive or memory-expensive. The configuration check for SASI indexes being enabled is a simple validation check and does not involve any significant performance impact at the system level. Additionally, the code does not contain any complex or time-consuming operations that would lead to notable performance variations. Therefore, the configuration can be classified as not performance-sensitive."
