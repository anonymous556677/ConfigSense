    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'gc_log_threshold_in_ms' is classified as performance-sensitive. This is because the 'GCInspector' constructor initializes 'gcStates' based on GarbageCollectorMXBean objects, which involves time-expensive operations like querying MBean server and creating new platform MXBean proxies. These operations directly impact system performance at the system level by consuming memory and CPU resources. Additionally, the configuration-related code context shows that the configuration is closely related to garbage collection behavior, which is critical for system performance optimization."
