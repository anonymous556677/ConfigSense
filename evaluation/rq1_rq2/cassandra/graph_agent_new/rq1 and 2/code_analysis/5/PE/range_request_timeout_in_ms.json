{
    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'range_request_timeout_in_ms' is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the 'getRangeRpcTimeout' method within the code context directly accesses the 'DatabaseDescriptor.getRangeRpcTimeout' method, which is a performance-related operation that retrieves the range RPC timeout in milliseconds. This operation contributes to the execution time and memory consumption of the system, leading to notable performance variations at the system level. Additionally, the 'getRangeRpcTimeout' method is called in multiple places within the code, indicating its importance in the performance of the system."
