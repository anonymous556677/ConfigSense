    "Reason": "The configuration option 'commit_failure_policy' is not performance-sensitive. The code related to this configuration does not involve any performance-related operations that are time-extensive or memory-extensive. The 'handleCommitError' and 'inspectCommitLogError' methods mainly handle error messages and do not have a direct and substantial impact on system performance at the system level."
