    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'internode_socket_send_buffer_size_in_bytes' is considered performance-sensitive. The code context shows that this configuration directly impacts the socket send buffer size for internode communication, which can have a significant impact on system performance. The method 'socketSendBufferSizeInBytes' retrieves this configuration value, indicating that it is crucial for determining the buffer size. Changes in this configuration can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, making it performance-sensitive."
