    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'read_request_timeout_in_ms' is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the 'read_request_timeout_in_ms' configuration directly affects the system performance at the system level. The code context shows that the configuration is used to set timeouts for read requests, which are critical for system performance. The 'getMinRpcTimeout' method calculates the minimum configured timeout for various RPC operations, including read requests. Additionally, the 'setup' method initializes system components and handles system startup, where the 'read_request_timeout_in_ms' configuration plays a role in setting timeouts for read operations. Therefore, the configuration involves performance-related operations that are time-extensive and memory-expensive, leading to notable performance variations at the system level."
