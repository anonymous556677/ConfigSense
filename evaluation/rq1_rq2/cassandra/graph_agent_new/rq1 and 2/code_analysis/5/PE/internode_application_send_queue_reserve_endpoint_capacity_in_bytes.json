    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'internode_application_send_queue_reserve_endpoint_capacity_in_bytes' is performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly impacts the capacity in bytes for reserving space in the send queue for messages being sent between nodes in the cluster. The code snippet provided shows that this configuration value is retrieved and used in the 'withDefaultReserveLimits' method, indicating that it plays a crucial role in determining the resource limits for outbound connections. Any changes to this configuration can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, making it performance-sensitive."
