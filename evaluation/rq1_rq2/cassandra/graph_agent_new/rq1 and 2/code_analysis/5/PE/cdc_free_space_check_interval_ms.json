{
    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'cdc_free_space_check_interval_ms' is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the configuration involves performance-related operations that are time-extensive within its related code. Specifically, the 'CDCSizeTracker' class, which is related to the configuration, performs disk space calculations and management operations that directly impact system performance at the system level. The 'CDCSizeTracker' class includes methods like 'processNewSegment' and 'processDiscardedSegment' that manipulate the disk space usage for CDC data, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Therefore, based on the code context and the nature of operations related to the configuration, it can be concluded that 'cdc_free_space_check_interval_ms' is performance-sensitive."
