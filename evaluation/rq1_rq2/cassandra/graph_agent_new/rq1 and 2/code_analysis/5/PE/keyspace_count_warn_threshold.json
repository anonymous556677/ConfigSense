{
    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'keyspace_count_warn_threshold' is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the 'keyspaceCount' variable in the code context is compared to the 'keyspace_count_warn_threshold' configuration value. If the 'keyspaceCount' exceeds the 'keyspace_count_warn_threshold', a warning message is logged, indicating that having a large number of keyspaces will significantly slow down schema-dependent cluster operations. This configuration directly impacts system performance by affecting the speed of schema-dependent cluster operations, making it performance-sensitive."
