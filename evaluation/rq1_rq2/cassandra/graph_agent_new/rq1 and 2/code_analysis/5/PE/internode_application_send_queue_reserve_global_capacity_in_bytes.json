    "Reason": "The configuration option 'internode_application_send_queue_reserve_global_capacity_in_bytes' does not appear to be performance-sensitive based on the provided code context. The code snippet shown does not involve any performance-related operations that are time-extensive or memory-extensive. Additionally, the configuration does not seem to directly and substantially affect system performance at the system level. Therefore, it is classified as not performance-sensitive."
