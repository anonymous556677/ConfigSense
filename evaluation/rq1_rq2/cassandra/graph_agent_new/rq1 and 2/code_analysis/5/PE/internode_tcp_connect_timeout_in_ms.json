    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'internode_tcp_connect_timeout_in_ms' is performance-sensitive. The code context shows that this configuration directly impacts the timeout value for TCP connections between nodes in a distributed system. TCP connection timeouts are critical for system performance as they can affect the overall communication latency and reliability between nodes. Therefore, any changes in this configuration can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Additionally, the code snippets indicate that this configuration involves time-expensive operations related to fetching the timeout value from the DatabaseDescriptor, further emphasizing its performance sensitivity."
