    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'file_cache_enabled' is performance-sensitive. The 'file_cache_enabled' configuration directly affects the system performance at the system level by enabling or disabling the ChunkCache based on the value retrieved from 'DatabaseDescriptor.getFileCacheEnabled()'. This configuration involves performance-related operations such as cache initialization, loading cache keys, and cache invalidation, which are time-expensive and memory-expensive operations. Enabling or disabling the file cache has a notable impact on the overall system performance, making it a performance-sensitive configuration."
