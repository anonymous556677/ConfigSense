    "Reason": "The configuration option 'stream_entire_sstables' is not performance-sensitive. The code snippet provided does not contain any performance-related operations that are time-expensive or memory-expensive. The configuration simply checks if full sstable transfers are disabled or if legacy counter shards are present before returning a boolean value. These checks do not directly and substantially affect system performance at the system level, leading to notable performance variations."
