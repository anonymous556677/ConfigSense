    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'streaming_keep_alive_period_in_secs' is performance-sensitive. The code context provided shows that this configuration directly affects the keep-alive period for streaming sessions. The method getStreamingKeepAlivePeriod() retrieves the value from this configuration variable, which is used to schedule keep-alive tasks with a specific period. Changing this configuration can have a direct impact on the performance of streaming sessions, as it determines how often keep-alive messages are sent. Therefore, any changes to this configuration can lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
