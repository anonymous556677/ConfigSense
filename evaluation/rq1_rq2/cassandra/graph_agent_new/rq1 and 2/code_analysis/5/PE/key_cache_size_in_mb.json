    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'key_cache_size_in_mb' is performance-sensitive. The code context provided shows that the 'key_cache_size_in_mb' configuration directly affects the initialization of the key cache with a specific capacity in megabytes. The 'keyCacheInMemoryCapacity' variable calculation based on this configuration value also indicates a memory-expensive operation. Additionally, the method 'getKeyCacheSizeInMB' is directly related to retrieving this configuration value. Any changes in the 'key_cache_size_in_mb' configuration can lead to notable performance variations at the system level due to the memory-expensive operations involved in initializing the key cache."
