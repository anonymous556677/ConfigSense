{
    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'compaction_throughput_mb_per_sec' is classified as performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the 'compaction_throughput_mb_per_sec' configuration directly affects the compaction rate limiter, which is a performance-related operation. The code context shows that the 'compaction_throughput_mb_per_sec' value is used to set the rate limit for compaction operations. This means that changes in the 'compaction_throughput_mb_per_sec' configuration can have a notable performance impact on the system level by affecting the rate at which compaction operations are performed, making it a performance-sensitive configuration."
