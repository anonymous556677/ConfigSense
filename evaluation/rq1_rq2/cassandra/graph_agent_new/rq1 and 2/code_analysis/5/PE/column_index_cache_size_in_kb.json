    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'column_index_cache_size_in_kb' is performance-sensitive. This is because the 'getColumnIndexCacheSize' method directly retrieves the column index cache size in kilobytes, which determines the threshold for holding sstable indexed key cache entries in memory. This operation is memory-expensive and can lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
