{
    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'diagnostic_events_enabled' is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the 'diagnostic_events_enabled' configuration directly affects the system performance at the system level. The code context provided shows that the 'diagnostic_events_enabled' configuration is checked multiple times in performance-related operations such as 'isEnabled' and 'isDiagnosticsEnabled'. These operations contribute to execution time and memory consumption, leading to notable performance variations at the system level. Therefore, the configuration is considered performance-sensitive."
