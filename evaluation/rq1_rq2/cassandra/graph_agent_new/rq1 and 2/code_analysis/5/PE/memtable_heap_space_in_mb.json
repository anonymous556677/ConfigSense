{
    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'memtable_heap_space_in_mb' is classified as performance-sensitive. This is because the value of 'memtable_heap_space_in_mb' directly impacts the calculation of heapLimit in the createMemtableAllocatorPool method, which in turn affects the allocation of memory for memtables. The allocation of memory is a time-expensive operation that can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Therefore, any changes to 'memtable_heap_space_in_mb' can have a substantial impact on system performance."
