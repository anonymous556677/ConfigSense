    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'cached_rows_warn_threshold' is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the 'DatabaseDescriptor.getCachedReplicaRowsWarnThreshold()' method is called within the 'resolveWithReplicaFilteringProtection' method, which is a critical part of the system's data resolution process. The value of 'cached_rows_warn_threshold' directly affects the behavior of the system in handling potentially out-of-date rows and impacts the performance at the system level by determining when to trigger warnings based on the cached replica rows threshold. Therefore, any changes to this configuration can lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
