    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'write_request_timeout_in_ms' is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the 'write_request_timeout_in_ms' configuration directly affects the timeout duration for write requests in the system. This timeout value is crucial for ensuring timely completion of write operations, and any changes to this configuration can have a significant impact on the overall performance of the system. The 'applyInternal' method, which handles mutations and updates, relies on this timeout value to manage the execution of write operations efficiently. Therefore, any modifications to 'write_request_timeout_in_ms' can lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
