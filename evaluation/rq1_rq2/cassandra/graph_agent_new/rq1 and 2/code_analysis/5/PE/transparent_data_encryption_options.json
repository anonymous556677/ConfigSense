    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'transparent_data_encryption_options' is not performance-sensitive. The code related to this configuration does not contain any performance-related operations that are time-expensive or memory-expensive. The configuration setting is used for creating a new Configuration object based on 'CommitLogCompression' and 'EncryptionContext', which does not directly and substantially affect system performance at the system level. The code mainly deals with handling commit log segments, reading commit log files, and handling CDC replay completion, which are not time-expensive or memory-expensive operations."
