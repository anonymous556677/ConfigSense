    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'batch_size_warn_threshold_in_kb' is performance-sensitive. The code context directly retrieves this configuration setting and returns it. Since the batch size warning threshold can impact the performance of batch operations, changes in this configuration can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, making it performance-sensitive."
