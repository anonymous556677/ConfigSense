    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'allocate_tokens_for_local_replication_factor' is performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration involves performance-related operations such as token allocation algorithm and token generation, which directly impact system performance at the system level. The code context shows that the configuration determines token allocation based on specified keyspace or local replication factor, which can significantly affect the performance of the system by influencing token distribution and data replication. Therefore, the configuration is considered performance-sensitive due to its direct and substantial impact on system performance."
