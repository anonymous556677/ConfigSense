    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'key_cache_save_period' is performance-sensitive. This is because the 'keyCacheSavePeriod' setting directly impacts the frequency at which the key cache is saved, which involves time-expensive operations like writing cache entries to disk. The scheduleSaving method uses this configuration setting to schedule the saving process, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Therefore, the configuration is considered performance-sensitive."
