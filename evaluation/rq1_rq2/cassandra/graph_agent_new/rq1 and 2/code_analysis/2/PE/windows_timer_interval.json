    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'windows_timer_interval' is performance-sensitive. The code context shows that the 'windows_timer_interval' configuration directly affects the system performance by adjusting the system timer on Windows. This adjustment impacts timer intervals, thread scheduling, driver interrupts, etc., which are time-expensive operations. The 'windows_timer_interval' configuration involves performance-related operations that are time-extensive and lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Therefore, it is classified as performance-sensitive."
