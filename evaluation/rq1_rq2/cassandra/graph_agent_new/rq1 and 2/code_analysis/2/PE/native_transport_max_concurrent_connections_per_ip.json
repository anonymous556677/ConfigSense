    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'native_transport_max_concurrent_connections_per_ip' is performance-sensitive. This is because the code context shows that this configuration is directly used to limit the number of concurrent client connections per source IP. The method 'getNativeTransportMaxConcurrentConnectionsPerIp' retrieves this configuration value and enforces the limit on the number of connections per IP. This directly impacts the system performance by controlling the resource usage based on the specified limit, leading to notable performance variations at the system level."
