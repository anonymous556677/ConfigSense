    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'full_query_logging_options' is performance-sensitive. The 'getFullQueryLoggerOptions()' method retrieves full query logging options, which involves accessing and copying various configuration parameters from the 'binLogOptions' object. These operations can be time-expensive and memory-expensive, especially when dealing with large configurations. Additionally, the 'enableFullQueryLogger()' method modifies the full query logging options based on input parameters, which can also have performance implications. Therefore, the configuration directly and substantially affects system performance at the system level by involving performance-related operations that lead to notable performance variations."
