{
    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'server_encryption_options' is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the 'server_encryption_options' configuration involves creating SSL contexts, which are expensive to create and consume a lot of resources. Additionally, the configuration includes methods like 'createSSLContext' and 'getOrCreateSslContext' which deal with SSL context creation and management, indicating time-expensive and memory-expensive operations. These operations directly impact system performance at the system level due to their resource-intensive nature."
