    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'file_cache_enabled' is performance-sensitive. The 'file_cache_enabled' configuration directly affects the system performance by enabling or disabling the file cache based on the value retrieved from 'DatabaseDescriptor.getFileCacheEnabled()'. The 'enabled' flag is used to instantiate the ChunkCache class, which in turn affects the caching behavior and memory consumption of the system. Additionally, the calculation of 'cacheSize' in the ChunkCache class is based on the file cache size in MB retrieved from 'DatabaseDescriptor.getFileCacheSizeInMB()', indicating that the configuration has a direct impact on memory usage and caching operations within the system. Therefore, the configuration is considered performance-sensitive as it involves performance-related operations that lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
