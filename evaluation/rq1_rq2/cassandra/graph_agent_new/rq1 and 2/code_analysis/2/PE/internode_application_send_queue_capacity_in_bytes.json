    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'internode_application_send_queue_capacity_in_bytes' is performance-sensitive. This is because the method 'applicationSendQueueCapacityInBytes' directly accesses the 'internode_application_send_queue_capacity_in_bytes' value, which is a crucial parameter related to the capacity of the application send queue. This configuration directly impacts the queuing and processing of messages between nodes in the cluster, which can have a significant effect on system performance at the system level. Therefore, any changes to this configuration can lead to notable performance variations, making it performance-sensitive."
