{
    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'memtable_cleanup_threshold' is classified as performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the 'memtable_cleanup_threshold' directly affects the cleaning threshold for memtables in the system, which in turn impacts the flushing of the largest memtable. This operation is time-expensive and memory-expensive as it involves managing the memory allocation and cleaning process for memtables. Therefore, any changes to the 'memtable_cleanup_threshold' configuration can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, making it performance-sensitive."
