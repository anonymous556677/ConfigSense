{
    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'internode_socket_send_buffer_size_in_bytes' is classified as performance-sensitive. The code context shows that this configuration directly impacts the socket send buffer size for internode communication. The method 'socketSendBufferSizeInBytes' retrieves this configuration value, which can significantly affect the performance of internode communication. Changes in the socket send buffer size can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, making this configuration performance-sensitive."
