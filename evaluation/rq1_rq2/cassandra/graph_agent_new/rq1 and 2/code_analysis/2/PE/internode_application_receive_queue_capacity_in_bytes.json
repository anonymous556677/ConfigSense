    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'internode_application_receive_queue_capacity_in_bytes' is performance-sensitive. This is because the 'applicationReceiveQueueCapacityInBytes' configuration parameter directly affects the capacity of the application receive queue, which can impact the performance of internode communication. The code snippet shows that this configuration parameter is checked for validity and used in the creation of 'InboundConnectionSettings', which is crucial for handling inbound messages efficiently. Additionally, the configuration parameter is set to a minimum value of 1 << 10, indicating its importance for system performance."
