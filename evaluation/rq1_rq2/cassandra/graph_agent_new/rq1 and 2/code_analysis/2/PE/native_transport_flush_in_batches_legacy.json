    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option native_transport_flush_in_batches_legacy is performance-sensitive. The method useNativeTransportLegacyFlusher() directly accesses this configuration parameter to determine whether to use native transport TCP message coalescing. This configuration directly affects the behavior of the system at the system level, potentially leading to notable performance variations. The use of native transport TCP message coalescing can have a significant impact on system performance, making this configuration performance-sensitive."
