    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'internode_tcp_connect_timeout_in_ms' is classified as performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the 'tcpConnectTimeoutInMS' method directly retrieves the internode TCP connect timeout value, which can have a notable impact on system performance. This configuration involves a performance-related operation that is time-expensive within its related code, affecting system performance at the system level."
