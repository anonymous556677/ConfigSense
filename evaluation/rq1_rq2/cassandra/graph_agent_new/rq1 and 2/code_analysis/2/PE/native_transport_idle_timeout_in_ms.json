    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'native_transport_idle_timeout_in_ms' is performance-sensitive. This is because the idle timeout value directly affects the behavior of closing idle client connections in the system, which can have a notable performance impact. The code context shows that the idle timeout value is used to create an IdleStateHandler in the channel pipeline, which closes client connections after a certain idle time. This operation can be time-expensive and can lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
