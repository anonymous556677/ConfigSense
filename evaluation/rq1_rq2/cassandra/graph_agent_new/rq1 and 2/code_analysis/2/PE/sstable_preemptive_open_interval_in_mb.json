    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'sstable_preemptive_open_interval_in_mb' is performance-sensitive. The code context shows that this configuration directly affects the calculation of the open interval in bytes, which can have a significant impact on system performance. The method 'calculateOpenInterval' uses this configuration to determine the interval, and any changes in this configuration can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Additionally, the unclear method 'getSSTablePreemptiveOpenIntervalInMB' further confirms the importance of this configuration in determining the open interval, making it performance-sensitive."
