    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'enable_materialized_views' is not performance-sensitive based on the provided code context. The code primarily deals with validation and processing logic related to creating materialized views in Cassandra. While the configuration may impact the execution of creating materialized views, it does not involve any time-expensive or memory-expensive operations that would lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The code focuses on basic dependency validations, processing SELECT and WHERE clauses, and building the materialized view, which are essential for ensuring data consistency and correctness rather than directly impacting system performance."
