    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'dynamic_snitch_update_interval_in_ms' is performance-sensitive. This is because the 'dynamicUpdateInterval' and 'dynamicResetInterval' values directly impact the scheduling of tasks that involve time-expensive operations, such as updating scores and resetting bad hosts. These tasks are scheduled at fixed intervals based on the configuration values, leading to notable performance variations at the system level. Additionally, the configuration-related code explicitly checks for changes in these intervals and re-schedules the tasks accordingly, emphasizing the importance of these values in system performance."
