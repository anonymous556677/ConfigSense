    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option cdc_total_space_in_mb is performance-sensitive. From the code context provided, the configuration value is used in the method allowableCDCBytes() to calculate the allowable CDC bytes by multiplying it with 1024*1024. This calculation directly impacts the memory consumption at the system level, as it determines the space allocated for change-data-capture logs on disk in Cassandra. Any changes in the cdc_total_space_in_mb configuration will have a notable performance impact on memory usage, making it a performance-sensitive configuration."
