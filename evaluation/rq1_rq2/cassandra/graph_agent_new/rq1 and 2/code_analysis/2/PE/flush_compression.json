    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'flush_compression' is performance-sensitive. The code context provided shows that the 'flush_compression' configuration directly affects the compression parameters used during the flushing of SSTables. The choice of compression algorithm can have a significant impact on the throughput during flushes, especially for large tables, which can potentially block writes. The code snippet includes a switch statement that allows for different compression options based on the 'DatabaseDescriptor.getFlushCompression()' method, indicating that the configuration can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Therefore, the configuration is considered performance-sensitive."
