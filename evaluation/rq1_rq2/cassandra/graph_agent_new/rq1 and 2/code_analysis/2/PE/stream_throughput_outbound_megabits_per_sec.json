    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'stream_throughput_outbound_megabits_per_sec' is classified as performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly affects the stream throughput outbound in megabits per second, which can have a substantial impact on the system's performance. The code context provided shows that changing the value of this configuration triggers the update of the stream throughput and rate limiting mechanisms, indicating that it involves time-expensive operations that can lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
