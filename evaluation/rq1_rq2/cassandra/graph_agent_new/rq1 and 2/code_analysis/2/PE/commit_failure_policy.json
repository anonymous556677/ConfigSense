    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'commit_failure_policy' is performance-sensitive. The handleCommitError method in the provided code context directly uses the commit failure policy from the configuration to determine how to handle commit errors. Depending on the policy set in the configuration, the method may perform time-expensive operations such as stopping transports or terminating threads, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Therefore, the configuration directly and substantially affects system performance by influencing the execution flow of the handleCommitError method based on the policy set."
