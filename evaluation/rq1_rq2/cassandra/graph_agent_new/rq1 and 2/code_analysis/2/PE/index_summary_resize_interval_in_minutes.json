    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'index_summary_resize_interval_in_minutes' is classified as performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the configuration directly affects the interval at which memory is redistributed from the fixed-size pool to sstables based on their recent read rates. This redistribution of memory involves time-expensive operations that can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Additionally, the code context shows that this configuration is used to set the resize interval for the index summary manager, which further emphasizes its impact on system performance."
