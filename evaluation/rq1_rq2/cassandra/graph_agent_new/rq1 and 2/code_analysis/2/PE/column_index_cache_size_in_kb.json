    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'column_index_cache_size_in_kb' is classified as performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the 'getColumnIndexCacheSize' method directly retrieves the value of 'column_index_cache_size_in_kb' from the configuration object, which is used to determine the size of the column index cache. This configuration directly affects the performance of the system by determining the cache size, which can have a notable impact on system performance at the system level."
