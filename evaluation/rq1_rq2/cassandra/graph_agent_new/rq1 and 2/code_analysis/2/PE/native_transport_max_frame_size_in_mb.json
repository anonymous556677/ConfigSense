    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'native_transport_max_frame_size_in_mb' is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the 'native_transport_max_frame_size_in_mb' configuration directly impacts the maximum total length of the message envelope in the system. The 'MAX_TOTAL_LENGTH' constant in the 'Decoder' class is set based on this configuration value, and exceeding this limit leads to discarding messages and throwing exceptions, affecting system performance at the system level."
