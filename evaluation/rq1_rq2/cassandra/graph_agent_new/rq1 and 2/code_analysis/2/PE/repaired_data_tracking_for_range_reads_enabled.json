    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'repaired_data_tracking_for_range_reads_enabled' is performance-sensitive. The code context shows that this configuration directly affects the performance of the system by enabling or disabling the tracking of repaired data for range reads. This tracking involves additional operations such as checking the number of full replicas and creating messages for data repair, which can have a notable impact on system performance. Therefore, the configuration is considered performance-sensitive as it involves time-expensive and memory-expensive operations that lead to significant performance variations at the system level."
