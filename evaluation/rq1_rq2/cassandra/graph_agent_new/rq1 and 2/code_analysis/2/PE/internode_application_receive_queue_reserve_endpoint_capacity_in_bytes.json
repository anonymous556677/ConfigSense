    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'internode_application_receive_queue_reserve_endpoint_capacity_in_bytes' is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the configuration directly affects the capacity of the application send queue for endpoints, which can impact the performance of internode communication at the system level. The code context shows that this configuration is used to determine the capacity of the application send queue for endpoints, which is crucial for handling outbound messages efficiently. Changes in this configuration can lead to notable performance variations in terms of message delivery and system throughput."
