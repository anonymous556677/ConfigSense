{
    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'cas_contention_timeout_in_ms' is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the 'doPaxos' method, which uses the 'cas_contention_timeout_in_ms' configuration, performs Paxos rounds for a given proposal and retries until the timeout. The method involves time-expensive operations such as preparing, proposing, and committing updates, which are directly related to the 'cas_contention_timeout_in_ms' configuration. The timeout value set by 'cas_contention_timeout_in_ms' directly affects the retry mechanism and overall performance of the Paxos rounds, leading to notable performance variations at the system level."
