    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'native_transport_max_threads' is performance-sensitive. The code context shows that the 'native_transport_max_threads' configuration directly affects the number of threads used by the requestExecutor, which is a time-expensive operation. This configuration directly impacts the system's performance by controlling the concurrency level of handling native transport requests. Therefore, any changes to this configuration can lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
