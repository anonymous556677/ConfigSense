    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'key_cache_size_in_mb' is classified as performance-sensitive. The 'key_cache_size_in_mb' configuration directly affects the capacity of the key cache in memory, which in turn impacts the performance of the system. The 'initKeyCache()' method initializes the key cache with the specified capacity in megabytes, and this capacity directly influences the memory consumption and performance of the system. The 'keyCacheInMemoryCapacity' calculation based on 'key_cache_size_in_mb' shows that the configuration is used in memory-intensive operations. Additionally, the size of the key cache affects the efficiency of caching and lookup operations, which are crucial for system performance. Therefore, the 'key_cache_size_in_mb' configuration is performance-sensitive and can lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
