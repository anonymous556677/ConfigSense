    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'enable_user_defined_functions' is performance-sensitive. This is because the 'assertUdfsEnabled' method checks if the 'enable_user_defined_functions' configuration setting is enabled before proceeding with certain operations. Disabling user-defined functions can have a significant impact on the performance of the system, as it can affect the execution time and memory consumption of operations related to user-defined functions. Therefore, this configuration directly and substantially affects system performance at the system level."
