    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'memtable_allocation_type' is performance-sensitive. This is because the 'memtable_allocation_type' directly impacts the allocation and management of memtable memory in Cassandra, which is crucial for system performance. The code snippet provided shows that different allocation types lead to different pool allocations, which can have a significant impact on memory usage and performance. Therefore, any changes in 'memtable_allocation_type' can result in notable performance variations at the system level."
