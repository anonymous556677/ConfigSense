    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'enable_transient_replication' is performance-sensitive. This is because the code snippet related to this configuration involves operations that directly impact system performance. Specifically, the validation of transient replicas and the check for transient replication being enabled in the 'validateReplicationStrategy' method can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The configuration directly affects the behavior of replication strategy and can result in significant performance impacts based on the conditions checked in the code."
