{
    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'write_request_timeout_in_ms' is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the 'write_request_timeout_in_ms' configuration directly affects the timeout duration for write requests, which can impact the overall system performance. The 'applyInternal' method, which is responsible for applying mutations and updating indexes, uses the 'write_request_timeout_in_ms' configuration to handle lock acquisition and view updates. The timeout duration set by 'write_request_timeout_in_ms' influences the behavior of mutation processing and view updates, which are critical operations for system performance. Therefore, any changes to 'write_request_timeout_in_ms' can have a notable impact on the system's performance at the system level."
