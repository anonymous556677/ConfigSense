{
    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'internode_tcp_user_timeout_in_ms' is classified as performance-sensitive. This is because the 'tcpUserTimeoutInMS' method directly returns the value of 'internode_tcp_user_timeout_in_ms' if it is not null, which indicates that this configuration has a direct impact on the execution time of the system. Additionally, the method calls 'getInternodeTcpUserTimeoutInMS()' and 'getInternodeStreamingTcpUserTimeoutInMS()' based on the connection category, which suggests that this configuration is involved in performance-related operations that can lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
