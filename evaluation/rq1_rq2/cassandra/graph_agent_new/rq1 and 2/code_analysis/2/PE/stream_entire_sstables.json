    "Reason": "The configuration option 'stream_entire_sstables' is not performance-sensitive. The code snippet provided does not contain any performance-related operations that are time-extensive or memory-extensive. The configuration only checks if full sstable transfers are disabled or if legacy counter shards are present, which are not directly and substantially affecting system performance at the system level. Therefore, this configuration does not lead to notable performance variations and should not be considered performance-sensitive."
