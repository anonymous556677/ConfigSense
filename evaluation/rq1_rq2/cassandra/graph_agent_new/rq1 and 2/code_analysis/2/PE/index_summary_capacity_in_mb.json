    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'index_summary_capacity_in_mb' is classified as performance-sensitive. The code context shows that the configuration setting for the memory pool size in MB directly impacts the initialization of the IndexSummaryManager. The method getIndexSummaryCapacityInMB() is used to retrieve this configuration value, which is then used to set the memory pool capacity. This configuration directly affects the memory consumption of the system, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
