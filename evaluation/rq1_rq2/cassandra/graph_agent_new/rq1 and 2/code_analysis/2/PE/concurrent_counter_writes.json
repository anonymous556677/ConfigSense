    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'concurrent_counter_writes' is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the 'CounterMutation' class contains methods like 'applyCounterMutation', 'grabCounterLocks', 'updateWithCurrentValuesFromCache', 'updateWithCurrentValuesFromCFS', which involve time-expensive operations like acquiring locks, reading values from cache and CF, and updating values. These operations directly impact system performance at the system level by introducing notable performance variations due to their time-expensive nature."
