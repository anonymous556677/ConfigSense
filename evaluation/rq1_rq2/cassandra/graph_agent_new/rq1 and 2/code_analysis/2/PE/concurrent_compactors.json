{
    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'concurrent_compactors' is performance-sensitive. This classification is based on the fact that the 'concurrent_compactors' configuration directly impacts the number of simultaneous compactions allowed in the system. The code context reveals that this configuration value is used to set the number of concurrent compactors, which can significantly affect the system's performance by influencing the efficiency of compaction operations. Since compaction is a critical process for maintaining database performance and data integrity, any changes to the number of concurrent compactors can have a notable impact on the system's overall performance. Therefore, the 'concurrent_compactors' configuration is considered performance-sensitive."
