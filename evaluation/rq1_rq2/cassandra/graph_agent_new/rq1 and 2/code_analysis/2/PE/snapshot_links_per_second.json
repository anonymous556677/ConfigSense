    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'snapshot_links_per_second' is performance-sensitive. The code context shows that this configuration directly impacts the rate limiter creation, which can have a significant effect on system performance. The method 'getSnapshotLinksPerSecond' involves a conditional check that determines the value based on the configuration setting, indicating that this configuration is crucial for controlling the performance of the system at the system level."
