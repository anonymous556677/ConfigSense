    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'incremental_backups' is performance-sensitive. The method 'maybeIncrementallyBackup' iterates through SSTableReader objects and creates links for incremental backups. This operation involves file I/O, which can be time-expensive and memory-expensive. Enabling or disabling incremental backups directly impacts the performance of the system at the system level by affecting the backup process. Therefore, the configuration is considered performance-sensitive."
