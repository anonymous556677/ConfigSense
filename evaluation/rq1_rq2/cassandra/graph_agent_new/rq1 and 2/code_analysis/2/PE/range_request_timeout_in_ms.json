    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'range_request_timeout_in_ms' is classified as performance-sensitive. This is because the 'getRangeRpcTimeout' method directly interacts with the system-level configuration 'DatabaseDescriptor.getRangeRpcTimeout' which is a performance-related operation. The method 'getRangeRpcTimeout' involves fetching the range RPC timeout from the DatabaseDescriptor, which can have a notable impact on system performance. Additionally, the 'getRangeRpcTimeout' method is called in multiple places within the code context, indicating its importance in determining timeout values for various operations. Therefore, the configuration is performance-sensitive as it directly affects system performance at the system level."
