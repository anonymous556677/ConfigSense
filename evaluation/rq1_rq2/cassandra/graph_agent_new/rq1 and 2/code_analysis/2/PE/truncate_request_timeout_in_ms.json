{
    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'truncate_request_timeout_in_ms' is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the 'getTruncateRpcTimeout' method involves time-expensive operations related to truncating data, which directly affects system performance. The method calculates a timeout value based on the difference between the configured timeout and the elapsed time, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Additionally, the 'get' method uses the timeout value for truncating data and throws exceptions based on the completion status, further emphasizing the performance impact of the configuration."
