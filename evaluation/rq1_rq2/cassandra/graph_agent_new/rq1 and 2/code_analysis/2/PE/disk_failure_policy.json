    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'disk_failure_policy' is not performance-sensitive. The code related to this configuration mainly handles disk failure policies and exceptions, such as stopping transports or marking paths as unwritable. These operations do not involve any significant time-expensive or memory-expensive tasks that would lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The configuration does not directly and substantially affect system performance in a way that would classify it as performance-sensitive."
