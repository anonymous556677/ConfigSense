    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'cross_node_timeout' is classified as performance-sensitive. The code context shows that this configuration parameter is used to determine whether to apply a cross-node timeout logic. This logic can have a significant impact on request processing times under overload conditions, as it affects how replicas handle requests. Therefore, the configuration directly and substantially affects system performance at the system level, making it performance-sensitive."
