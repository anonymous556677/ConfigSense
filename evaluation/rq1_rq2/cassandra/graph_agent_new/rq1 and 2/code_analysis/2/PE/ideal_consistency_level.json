{
    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'ideal_consistency_level' is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the 'ideal_consistency_level' directly affects the performance of the system at the system level by tracking the ideal consistency level in the write response handler. The code snippet related to the 'ideal_consistency_level' configuration involves operations that are time-expensive, such as constructing delegate response handlers based on the ideal consistency level. These operations lead to notable performance variations at the system level, making the configuration performance-sensitive."
