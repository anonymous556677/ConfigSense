    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'max_hints_delivery_threads' is performance-sensitive. This is because the 'max_hints_delivery_threads' value is directly used to determine the number of threads for delivering hints in the HintsDispatchExecutor. The number of delivery threads can have a significant impact on the system's performance, especially in scenarios with high hint delivery loads. Therefore, any changes to 'max_hints_delivery_threads' can lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
