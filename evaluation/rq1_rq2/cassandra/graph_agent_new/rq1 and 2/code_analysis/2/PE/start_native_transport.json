    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'start_native_transport' is performance-sensitive. The code context provided shows that this configuration directly impacts the starting of the native transport server, which involves time-expensive operations such as validating if transports can start and starting the native transport service. This can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, making it performance-sensitive."
