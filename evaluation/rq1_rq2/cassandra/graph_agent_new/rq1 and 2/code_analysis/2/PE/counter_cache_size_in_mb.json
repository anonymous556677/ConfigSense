    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'counter_cache_size_in_mb' is performance-sensitive. The code context provided shows that the size of the counter cache in megabytes directly impacts the capacity of the cache, which in turn affects memory consumption. The method 'getCounterCacheSizeInMB()' is used to retrieve this configuration value and is crucial in determining the cache capacity. Since the size of the cache directly influences memory consumption and potentially execution time, any changes to this configuration can lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
