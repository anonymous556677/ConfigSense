    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'snapshot_before_compaction' is performance-sensitive. This is because the code related to this configuration involves time-expensive and memory-expensive operations that directly impact system performance at the system level. The 'snapshotWithoutFlush' method called when 'DatabaseDescriptor.isSnapshotBeforeCompaction()' is true, creates a snapshot of the current state of the system which can be memory-intensive. Additionally, the compaction process itself involves significant operations like scanning, merging, and writing new SSTables, all of which are time-expensive and memory-expensive. These operations can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, making the 'snapshot_before_compaction' configuration performance-sensitive."
