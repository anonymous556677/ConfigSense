    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'tombstone_failure_threshold' is not performance-sensitive. The code related to this configuration does not involve any performance-sensitive operations that could lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The configuration is a simple method that retrieves the tombstone failure threshold value from the Database Descriptor, which is not directly impacting system performance."
