    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'streaming_connections_per_host' is performance-sensitive. This is because the 'streaming_connections_per_host' configuration directly affects the number of streaming connections allowed per host, which can have a significant impact on system performance. The code context shows that this configuration parameter is used in the 'bootstrap' and 'rebuild' methods, which involve streaming data and communication between nodes. The number of streaming connections per host can affect the efficiency and speed of data transfer, making it a performance-sensitive configuration."
