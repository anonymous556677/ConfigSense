{
    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'concurrent_materialized_view_writes' is performance-sensitive. The code context provided includes operations such as acquiring locks, updating views, and building views, which are time-expensive and memory-expensive operations. These operations directly impact system performance at the system level by affecting the execution time and memory consumption. Additionally, the configuration involves handling mutations and partition updates, which can lead to notable performance variations. Therefore, based on the code analysis, the configuration is classified as performance-sensitive."
