    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'streaming_keep_alive_period_in_secs' is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the configuration directly affects the keep-alive period for streaming, which involves time-expensive operations related to sending keep-alive messages at regular intervals. This can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, especially if the keep-alive period is set too low or too high, impacting the overall streaming performance. The code context also emphasizes the importance of this configuration by suggesting to increase the keep-alive period if response delays occur, indicating its significant impact on system performance."
