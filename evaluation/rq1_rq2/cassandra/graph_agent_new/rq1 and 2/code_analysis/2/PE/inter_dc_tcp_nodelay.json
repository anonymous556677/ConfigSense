    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'inter_dc_tcp_nodelay' is performance-sensitive. The code context provided shows that the configuration setting is used to determine whether to enable TCP_NODELAY for inter-datacenter communication. Enabling or disabling TCP_NODELAY can have a significant impact on network performance by affecting packet size, overhead, and latency for cross-datacenter responses. This directly influences system performance at the network level, making it a performance-sensitive configuration."
