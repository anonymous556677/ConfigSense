    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'file_cache_size_in_mb' is performance-sensitive. The code context shows that the 'file_cache_size_in_mb' configuration directly affects the calculation of the 'cacheSize' variable, which is used to determine the size of the cache. The 'cacheSize' variable is a key factor in the performance of the ChunkCache class as it determines the maximum weight of the cache. Any changes in the 'file_cache_size_in_mb' configuration will have a direct and substantial impact on the system performance at the system level by affecting the cache size and memory consumption."
