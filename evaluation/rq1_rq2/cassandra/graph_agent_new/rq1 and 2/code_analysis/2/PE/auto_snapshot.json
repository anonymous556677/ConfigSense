    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'auto_snapshot' is performance-sensitive. The code context provided shows that the 'auto_snapshot' configuration directly affects the system performance by taking a snapshot of the data before truncation. This operation involves time-expensive and memory-expensive operations such as flushing memtables, truncating indexes, and saving truncation records, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Additionally, the code snippet indicates that the 'auto_snapshot' configuration is crucial for ensuring data consistency and preventing data loss during truncation, further emphasizing its performance sensitivity."
