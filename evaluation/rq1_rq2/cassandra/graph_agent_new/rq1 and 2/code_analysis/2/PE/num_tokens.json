{
    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'num_tokens' is performance-sensitive. The code context provided contains operations that directly impact system performance, such as checking the number of tokens, validating replication factors, and joining the token ring. These operations involve time-expensive and memory-expensive tasks that can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Additionally, the configuration directly affects the distribution of data across the cluster, which is crucial for system performance. Therefore, based on the code analysis, the 'num_tokens' configuration is classified as performance-sensitive."
