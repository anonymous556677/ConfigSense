    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'initial_token' configuration option is performance-sensitive. This is because the 'initial_tokens' collection is directly used in the code to determine the tokens to be used for bootstrap operations. The presence and size of 'initial_tokens' directly impact the execution flow of the method and can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Additionally, the method includes conditional logic based on the 'initial_tokens' collection, which further emphasizes the performance sensitivity of this configuration."
