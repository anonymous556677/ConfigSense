    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'memtable_heap_space_in_mb' is performance-sensitive. The code context shows that this configuration directly impacts the memory allocation for memtables, which can have a significant effect on system performance. The method 'getMemtableHeapSpaceInMb' retrieves the value for this configuration setting, indicating its importance in determining memory usage. Since memtable allocation plays a crucial role in database performance, any changes to this configuration can lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
