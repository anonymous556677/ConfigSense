    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option internode_application_send_queue_reserve_endpoint_capacity_in_bytes is performance-sensitive. This is because the code context shows that this configuration directly affects the application's reserve send queue capacity in bytes, which can have a substantial impact on the system's performance at the system level. The configuration involves performance-related operations that determine the capacity limits for message queuing, which can significantly impact execution time and memory consumption. Additionally, the method getInternodeApplicationSendQueueReserveEndpointCapacityInBytes directly retrieves this configuration value, further emphasizing its performance sensitivity."
