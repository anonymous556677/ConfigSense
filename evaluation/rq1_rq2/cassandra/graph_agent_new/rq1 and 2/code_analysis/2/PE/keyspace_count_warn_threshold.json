    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'keyspace_count_warn_threshold' is performance-sensitive. The code context provided shows that this configuration is used to determine when a client warning should be sent based on the number of keyspaces in the cluster. Having a large number of keyspaces can significantly slow down schema-dependent cluster operations, as mentioned in the warning message. This configuration directly impacts system performance by affecting the execution time of schema-dependent operations, making it performance-sensitive."
