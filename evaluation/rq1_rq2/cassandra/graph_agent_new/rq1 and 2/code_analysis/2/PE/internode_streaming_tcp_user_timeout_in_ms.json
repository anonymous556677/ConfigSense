    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'internode_streaming_tcp_user_timeout_in_ms' is classified as performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly affects the timeout for processing incoming stream messages in the 'receive' method. The 'receive' method involves time-expensive operations such as processing incoming stream messages and checking if the processing time exceeds the configured timeout value. If the processing time exceeds the timeout value, a warning message is logged, indicating a potential performance impact on the system level. Therefore, the configuration is performance-sensitive as it directly and substantially affects system performance by potentially closing streaming connections due to timeout constraints."
