    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'concurrent_materialized_view_builders' is performance-sensitive. The 'concurrent_materialized_view_builders' configuration directly affects the system's performance by setting the number of concurrent view builders. This configuration impacts the system level by controlling the number of tasks that can run concurrently, which can significantly affect performance. The code context shows that this configuration is used to get and set the number of concurrent view builders, which are essential for managing compaction tasks efficiently. Therefore, any changes to this configuration can have notable performance implications at the system level."
