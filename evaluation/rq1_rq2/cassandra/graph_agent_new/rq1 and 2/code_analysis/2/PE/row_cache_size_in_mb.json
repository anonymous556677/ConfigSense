    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'row_cache_size_in_mb' is performance-sensitive. This is because the 'row_cache_size_in_mb' configuration directly affects the capacity of the row cache in memory, which can have a significant impact on system performance. The code context shows that the row cache size is used to set the capacity of the cache, and the size of the cache can impact the execution time and memory consumption of the system. Therefore, any changes to the 'row_cache_size_in_mb' configuration can lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
