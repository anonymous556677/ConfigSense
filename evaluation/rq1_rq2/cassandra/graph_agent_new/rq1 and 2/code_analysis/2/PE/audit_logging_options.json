    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'audit_logging_options' is performance-sensitive. The code context provided shows that the configuration directly affects the behavior of the AuditLogManager and BinAuditLogger classes, which are crucial components for enabling and managing audit logging. The configuration settings impact the creation of AuditLogger objects, which can have a significant performance impact depending on the parameters provided. Additionally, the enableAuditLog method uses the configuration settings to enable audit logging with specific parameters, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Therefore, the 'audit_logging_options' configuration is considered performance-sensitive based on its direct influence on performance-related operations within the code."
