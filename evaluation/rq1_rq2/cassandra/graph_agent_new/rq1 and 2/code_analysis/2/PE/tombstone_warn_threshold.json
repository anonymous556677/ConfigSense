    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'tombstone_warn_threshold' is not performance-sensitive. The code context related to this configuration does not involve any performance-related operations that are time-expensive or memory-expensive. The configuration is used to retrieve the tombstone warning threshold value from the DatabaseDescriptor, which is a static configuration setting. This setting does not directly and substantially affect system performance at the system level, and it does not lead to notable performance variations."
