    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'dynamic_snitch_reset_interval_in_ms' is performance-sensitive. This is because the 'dynamicResetInterval' configuration directly affects the scheduling of tasks that involve time-expensive operations. The code snippet shows that the 'resetSchedular' is scheduled with a fixed delay based on the 'dynamicResetInterval' value, which indicates that changes in this configuration can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Additionally, the 'reset' task is crucial for allowing hosts to recover and change their score, which can impact system performance significantly. Therefore, the configuration is considered performance-sensitive based on its direct and substantial impact on system performance through time-expensive operations."
