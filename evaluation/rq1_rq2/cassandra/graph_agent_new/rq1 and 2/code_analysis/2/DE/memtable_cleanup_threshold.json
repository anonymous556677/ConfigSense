A larger memtable_cleanup_threshold value will result in larger flushes and less compaction, but also less concurrent flush activity. This can make it difficult to keep the disks fed under heavy write load. The default calculation for memtable_cleanup_threshold is 1 / (memtable_flush_writers + 1), which is the only reasonable choice according to the configuration description."
