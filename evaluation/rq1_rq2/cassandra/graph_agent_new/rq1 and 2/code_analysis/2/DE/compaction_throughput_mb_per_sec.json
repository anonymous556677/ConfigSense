The faster you insert data, the faster you need to compact in order to keep the sstable count down, but in general, setting this to 16 to 32 times the rate you are inserting data is more than sufficient. Setting this to 0 disables throttling. Note that this accounts for all types of compaction, including validation compaction (building Merkle trees for repairs).",

    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The configuration is triggered whenever a compaction operation is performed in the system. The frequency of triggering depends on the rate of data insertion and the need for compaction to keep the sstable count down.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "Setting the 'compaction_throughput_mb_per_sec' to a higher value can increase the speed of compaction operations, which can help in managing the sstable count efficiently. However, setting it too high may lead to resource contention and performance issues. On the other hand, setting it to 0 disables throttling, which can potentially overwhelm the system with compaction tasks."
