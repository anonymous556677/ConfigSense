    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The configuration 'internode_tcp_connect_timeout_in_ms' is used to determine the amount of time to wait for internode tcp connections to establish in Cassandra. The method 'tcpConnectTimeoutInMS' returns the value of 'tcpConnectTimeoutInMS' if it is not null, otherwise it calls 'getInternodeTcpConnectTimeoutInMS' method from DatabaseDescriptor.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The triggering frequency of the 'internode_tcp_connect_timeout_in_ms' configuration depends on the network conditions and the frequency of internode tcp connections being established in the system. It is typically triggered when nodes in the Cassandra cluster need to establish internode tcp connections.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the 'internode_tcp_connect_timeout_in_ms' configuration option is crucial for protecting Cassandra from true network partitions. Setting an appropriate timeout value can help prevent network-related issues and improve the stability of the Cassandra cluster. However, setting it too high may result in longer connection establishment times and potential performance degradation."
