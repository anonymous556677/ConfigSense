    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The 'incremental_backups' configuration in the code enables Cassandra to create a hard link to each sstable flushed or streamed locally in a backups/ subdirectory of the keyspace data. This is done by calling the maybeIncrementallyBackup method which checks if incremental backups are enabled and then creates links for each sstable in the provided Iterable.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The triggering frequency of the 'incremental_backups' configuration depends on how often the maybeIncrementallyBackup method is called in the system. This would typically occur when sstables are flushed or streamed locally.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the 'incremental_backups' configuration option is that it allows for efficient backups by creating hard links to sstables instead of copying the entire data. This can save storage space and reduce the time required for backups. However, it is important to note that removing these links is the operator's responsibility."
