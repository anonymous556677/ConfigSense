    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The configuration 'internode_compression' is used in the code to determine whether the connection between nodes should be compressed. It checks if the internodeCompression setting in the DatabaseDescriptor is set to 'all' or 'dc' and if the connection is within the local datacenter.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The triggering frequency of the 'internode_compression' configuration depends on the number of inter-node communications happening in the system. If there are frequent communications between nodes, this configuration will be triggered more often.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the 'internode_compression' configuration option on the system is that it can reduce the amount of data transferred between nodes by compressing the traffic. This can lead to improved network performance and reduced bandwidth usage, especially in scenarios where there is high inter-node communication."
