    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The 'commitlog_compression' configuration is used to specify the compression to apply to the commit log. The code initializes the CommitLog object with the compression configuration obtained from DatabaseDescriptor. The supported compressors are LZ4, Snappy, and Deflate. If the compression configuration is omitted, the commit log will be written uncompressed.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The triggering frequency of the 'commitlog_compression' configuration depends on when the CommitLog object is initialized. Typically, this configuration is triggered during the initialization of the CommitLog object, which may happen when the system starts up or when the CommitLog service is restarted.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the 'commitlog_compression' configuration option on the system is related to the size of the commit log files. Using compression can reduce the size of the commit log files, which can lead to savings in storage space and potentially improve performance by reducing disk I/O operations. However, compression and decompression operations may introduce additional CPU overhead."
