    "config_description": "Total permitted memory to use for memtables. Cassandra will stop accepting writes when the limit is exceeded until a flush completes, and will trigger a flush based on memtable_cleanup_threshold If omitted, Cassandra will set both to 1/4 the size of the heap.",
    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The 'memtable_heap_space_in_mb' configuration is used to set the total permitted memory to use for memtables in Cassandra. The code snippet provided shows how the configuration value is read from the 'DatabaseDescriptor' class and used to calculate the heapLimit and offHeapLimit for creating the MemtablePool.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The triggering frequency of the 'memtable_heap_space_in_mb' configuration depends on the memtable_cleanup_threshold value set in the Cassandra configuration. When the total memory used by memtables exceeds the limit specified by 'memtable_heap_space_in_mb', Cassandra will stop accepting writes until a flush completes. The frequency of triggering a flush is based on the memtable_cleanup_threshold value.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the 'memtable_heap_space_in_mb' configuration option on the system is significant. If the configured memory limit is too low, Cassandra may frequently trigger flushes, impacting write performance. On the other hand, if the limit is set too high, it may lead to excessive memory usage and potential out-of-memory errors. It is crucial to set this configuration carefully based on the workload and available system resources."
