    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The configuration 'batch_size_fail_threshold_in_kb' is used to set the threshold for failing any multiple-partition batch that exceeds the specified value. It is retrieved using the method getBatchSizeFailureThreshold() which internally calls DatabaseDescriptor.getBatchSizeFailThresholdInKB().",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The triggering frequency of the 'batch_size_fail_threshold_in_kb' configuration depends on the batch size of the operations being performed. If a multiple-partition batch exceeds the specified threshold value, the configuration will be triggered to fail the batch.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the 'batch_size_fail_threshold_in_kb' configuration option on the system is that it helps in preventing large batches from causing performance issues or failures. By setting an appropriate threshold, the system can handle batches more efficiently and avoid potential bottlenecks."
