    "config_description": "Per sstable indexed key cache entries (the collation index in memory mentioned above) exceeding this size will not be held on heap. This means that only partition information is held on heap and the index entries are read from disk.  Note that this size refers to the size of the serialized index information and not the size of the partition.",
    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The configuration 'column_index_cache_size_in_kb' is used to determine the size limit for sstable indexed key cache entries. If the size of the entries exceeds this limit, they will not be held in heap memory and will be read from disk instead.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The triggering frequency of this configuration depends on the amount of indexed key cache entries being stored and accessed in the system. If the size of the entries exceeds the configured limit, the configuration will be triggered.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the 'column_index_cache_size_in_kb' configuration option is that it affects the memory usage and performance of the system. If the size limit is set too low, it may result in more disk reads and potentially slower performance. On the other hand, setting it too high may lead to increased memory usage."
