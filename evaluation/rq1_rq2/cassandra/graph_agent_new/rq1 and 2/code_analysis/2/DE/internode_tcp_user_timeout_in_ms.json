The amount of time to wait for internode tcp connections to establish. internode_tcp_connect_timeout_in_ms: 2000  The amount of time unacknowledged data is allowed on a connection before we throw out the connection Note this is only supported on Linux + epoll, and it appears to behave oddly above a setting of 30000 (it takes much longer than 30s) as of Linux 4.12. If you want something that high set this to 0 which picks up the OS default and configure the net.ipv4.tcp_retries2 sysctl to be ~8.",
    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The configuration 'internode_tcp_user_timeout_in_ms' is used to determine the amount of time to wait for internode TCP connections to establish in Cassandra. The code snippet provided shows that the 'tcpUserTimeoutInMS' method checks if the configuration value is set, and if not, it retrieves the value based on the connection category (messaging or streaming) from the DatabaseDescriptor.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The triggering frequency of the 'internode_tcp_user_timeout_in_ms' configuration in the system depends on the frequency of establishing internode TCP connections in Cassandra. This configuration is triggered whenever a new internode TCP connection is being established, either for messaging or streaming purposes.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the 'internode_tcp_user_timeout_in_ms' configuration option on the system is significant as it determines the amount of time allowed for internode TCP connections to establish. Setting this configuration too low may result in connection timeouts and potential network issues, while setting it too high may lead to longer connection establishment times. It is crucial to configure this value appropriately based on the network environment and system requirements to ensure smooth operation of Cassandra."
