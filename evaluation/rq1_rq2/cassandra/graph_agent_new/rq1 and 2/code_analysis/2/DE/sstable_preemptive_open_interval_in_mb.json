    "config_description": "When compacting, the replacement sstable(s) can be opened before they are completely written, and used in place of the prior sstables for any range that has been written. This helps to smoothly transfer reads between the sstables, reducing page cache churn and keeping hot rows hot",
    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The configuration 'sstable_preemptive_open_interval_in_mb' is used to calculate the open interval for preemptive opening of SSTables. The method calculateOpenInterval() multiplies the value of 'sstable_preemptive_open_interval_in_mb' by 1MB (1L << 20) to get the interval. If certain conditions are met, the interval is set to Long.MAX_VALUE.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The triggering frequency of the 'sstable_preemptive_open_interval_in_mb' configuration depends on the frequency of compacting operations in the system. Whenever compacting occurs, this configuration is used to determine the open interval for preemptive opening of SSTables.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the 'sstable_preemptive_open_interval_in_mb' configuration is that it helps in smoothly transferring reads between SSTables during compaction, reducing page cache churn and keeping hot rows hot. By opening replacement SSTables before they are completely written, it optimizes the read performance of the system."
