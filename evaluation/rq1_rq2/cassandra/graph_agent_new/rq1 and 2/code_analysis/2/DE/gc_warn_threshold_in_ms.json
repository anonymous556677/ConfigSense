    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The configuration 'gc_warn_threshold_in_ms' is used to set a threshold for logging GC pauses at WARN level. If the GC pauses exceed this threshold, they will be logged at WARN level. The configuration can be adjusted based on the application's throughput requirement, and setting it to 0 will deactivate the feature.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The configuration is triggered whenever a GC pause occurs that exceeds the threshold set by 'gc_warn_threshold_in_ms'. The frequency of triggering depends on the frequency and duration of GC pauses in the system.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the 'gc_warn_threshold_in_ms' configuration option on the system is that it affects the logging level of GC pauses. Setting a higher threshold may result in fewer GC pauses being logged at WARN level, while setting a lower threshold may result in more GC pauses being logged. This can impact the system's performance monitoring and troubleshooting capabilities."
