    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The configuration 'batch_size_warn_threshold_in_kb' is used to set a threshold value for warning log messages when a multiple-partition batch size exceeds the specified value. The method getBatchSizeWarnThreshold() retrieves the value of this configuration from DatabaseDescriptor.",

    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "Increasing the size of the 'batch_size_warn_threshold_in_kb' configuration can lead to node instability as it allows larger batch operations to be processed. This can potentially increase the load on the system and affect its performance. It is important to carefully consider the impact of changing this configuration to avoid any negative consequences."
