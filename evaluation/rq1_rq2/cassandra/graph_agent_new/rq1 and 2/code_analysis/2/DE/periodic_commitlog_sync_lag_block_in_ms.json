    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The configuration 'periodic_commitlog_sync_lag_block_in_ms' is used in the PeriodicCommitLogService class to determine the amount of time to block writes while waiting for a slow disk flush to complete. It calculates the expected sync time based on the current time and the configured block time in nanoseconds.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The triggering frequency of the 'periodic_commitlog_sync_lag_block_in_ms' configuration depends on the system's disk flush performance and the frequency of writes to the commit log. If the disk flush is slow or there are frequent writes, this configuration will be triggered more often.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the 'periodic_commitlog_sync_lag_block_in_ms' configuration on the system is that it can potentially block write operations for the specified number of milliseconds, affecting the overall performance and latency of write operations. If the configured block time is too long, it may lead to increased latency for write operations."
