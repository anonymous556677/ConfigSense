    "config_description": "Throttles all streaming file transfer between the datacenters, this setting allows users to throttle inter dc stream throughput in addition to throttling all network stream traffic as configured with stream_throughput_outbound_megabits_per_sec When unset, the default is 200 Mbps or 25 MB/s",
    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The configuration 'inter_dc_stream_throughput_outbound_megabits_per_sec' is used to throttle all streaming file transfer between the datacenters. It allows users to throttle inter dc stream throughput in addition to throttling all network stream traffic as configured with 'stream_throughput_outbound_megabits_per_sec'. The configuration value is set and retrieved using the provided methods.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The configuration is triggered whenever the 'setInterDCStreamThroughputMbPerSec' method is called to set a new value for the inter DC stream throughput. The 'calculateInterDCRateInBytes' method also triggers the configuration when calculating the inter DC rate in bytes.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the 'inter_dc_stream_throughput_outbound_megabits_per_sec' configuration option is that it controls the rate at which data is transferred between datacenters. Setting a lower value will limit the throughput, potentially affecting the speed of data transfer between datacenters. Setting a higher value may increase the throughput but could also lead to network congestion and performance issues."
