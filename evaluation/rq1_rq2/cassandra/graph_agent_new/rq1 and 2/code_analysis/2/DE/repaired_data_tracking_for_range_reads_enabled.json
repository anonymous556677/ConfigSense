    "config_description": "Enable tracking of repaired state of data during reads and comparison between replicas Mismatches between the repaired sets of replicas can be characterized as either confirmed or unconfirmed. In this context, unconfirmed indicates that the presence of pending repair sessions, unrepaired partition tombstones, or some other condition means that the disparity cannot be considered conclusive. Confirmed mismatches should be a trigger for investigation as they may be indicative of corruption or data loss. There are separate flags for range vs partition reads as single partition reads are only tracked when CL > 1 and a digest mismatch occurs. Currently, range queries don't use digests so if enabled for range reads, all range reads will include repaired data tracking. As this adds some overhead, operators may wish to disable it whilst still enabling it for partition reads",
    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The configuration 'repaired_data_tracking_for_range_reads_enabled' works by enabling the tracking of repaired state of data during reads and comparison between replicas. It checks if the flag is enabled and if there are multiple full replicas to compare results from, then it tracks the repaired status.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The triggering frequency of the 'repaired_data_tracking_for_range_reads_enabled' configuration depends on the number of range reads with multiple full replicas to compare results from. If there are frequent range reads with multiple full replicas, then this configuration will be triggered more often.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "Enabling the 'repaired_data_tracking_for_range_reads_enabled' configuration adds overhead to the system as it involves tracking repaired data during reads and comparison between replicas. This can impact system performance, especially if there are frequent range reads with multiple full replicas, as it adds additional processing for tracking and comparing repaired data."
