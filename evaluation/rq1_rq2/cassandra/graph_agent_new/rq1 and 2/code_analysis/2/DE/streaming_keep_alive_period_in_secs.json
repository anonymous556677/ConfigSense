It determines how often a node will send a keep-alive message to its peer.

A shorter period may lead to more frequent keep-alive messages being sent, potentially reducing the risk of session timeouts but increasing network traffic. On the other hand, a longer period may reduce network traffic but increase the risk of session timeouts if peers do not respond in time."
