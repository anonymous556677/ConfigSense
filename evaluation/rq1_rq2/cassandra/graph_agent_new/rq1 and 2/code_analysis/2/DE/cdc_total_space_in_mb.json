If space gets above this value, Cassandra will throw WriteTimeoutException on Mutations including tables with CDC enabled. A CDCCompactor is responsible for parsing the raw CDC logs and deleting them when parsing is completed.  The default value is the min of 4096 mb and 1/8th of the total space of the drive where cdc_raw_directory resides.",
    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The configuration code 'cdc_total_space_in_mb' is used to determine the total space allocated for change-data-capture logs on disk. It retrieves the value set for CDC space in MB from the DatabaseDescriptor and converts it to bytes by multiplying by 1024*1024.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The configuration 'cdc_total_space_in_mb' is triggered whenever there is a need to check the available space for change-data-capture logs on disk. This could happen when writing mutations to tables with CDC enabled and the space allocated for CDC logs is being reached.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the 'cdc_total_space_in_mb' configuration option is significant as it determines the threshold for space allocation for CDC logs. If the space allocated gets above this value, Cassandra will throw WriteTimeoutException on Mutations including tables with CDC enabled. This can impact the performance and reliability of the system as it may lead to data loss or inconsistency if CDC logs cannot be written due to space constraints."
