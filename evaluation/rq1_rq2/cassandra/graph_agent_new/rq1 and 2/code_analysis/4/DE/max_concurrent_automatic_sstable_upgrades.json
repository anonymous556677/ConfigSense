    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The configuration 'max_concurrent_automatic_sstable_upgrades' controls the maximum number of concurrent automatic sstable upgrades that can be triggered. The code snippet provided shows that the configuration is used to limit the number of upgrade tasks that can run concurrently. The 'maybeRunUpgradeTask' method checks if the current number of background upgrading tasks is less than or equal to the value specified in 'max_concurrent_automatic_sstable_upgrades' before executing an upgrade task.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The triggering frequency of the configuration depends on the workload and the availability of upgrade tasks. If there are no ordinary compaction tasks to perform, the system will trigger automatic sstable upgrades based on the value specified in 'max_concurrent_automatic_sstable_upgrades'. The frequency of triggering will vary based on the number of upgrade tasks available and the workload on the system.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the 'max_concurrent_automatic_sstable_upgrades' configuration option on the system is that it can control the concurrency of sstable upgrades. Setting a higher value for this configuration can potentially increase the system's performance by allowing more upgrades to be processed concurrently. However, setting a very high value may also lead to resource contention and affect the overall system stability. Therefore, it is important to tune this configuration based on the system's workload and resources."
