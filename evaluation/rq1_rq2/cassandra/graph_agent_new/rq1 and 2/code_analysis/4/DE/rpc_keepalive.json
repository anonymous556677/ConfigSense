    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The rpc_keepalive configuration in the code determines whether keepalive is enabled or disabled on rpc/native connections. It is used to configure the behavior of the connections in terms of keepalive functionality.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The rpc_keepalive configuration is triggered when the Server class is instantiated and the configuration is applied during the initialization of the server. The triggering frequency depends on how often new server instances are created in the system.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "Enabling or disabling keepalive on rpc/native connections can impact the system's network performance and resource utilization. Enabling keepalive can help maintain persistent connections and reduce connection setup overhead, but it may also consume more resources. Disabling keepalive may save resources but can result in more frequent connection setups."
