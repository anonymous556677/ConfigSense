Depending on the value of this configuration, different types of MemtablePool objects are created with specific parameters like heapLimit, offHeapLimit, cleaningThreshold, and cleaner function.",

Choosing different allocation types can impact the performance and memory usage of the system, with options like offheap_buffers and offheap_objects potentially offering better performance but requiring more careful memory management."
