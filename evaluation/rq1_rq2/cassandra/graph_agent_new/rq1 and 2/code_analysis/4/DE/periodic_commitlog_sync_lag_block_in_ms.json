    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The 'periodic_commitlog_sync_lag_block_in_ms' configuration is used in the PeriodicCommitLogService class to calculate the expected sync time for a commit log segment. It determines the number of milliseconds to block writes while waiting for a slow disk flush to complete.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The triggering frequency of the 'periodic_commitlog_sync_lag_block_in_ms' configuration depends on the frequency of writes to the commit log and the speed of disk flush operations. It is triggered whenever a new commit log segment is allocated and a sync operation is required.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the 'periodic_commitlog_sync_lag_block_in_ms' configuration on the system is that it can potentially slow down write operations if the disk flush operations are slow. It helps in ensuring data durability by blocking writes until the sync operation is completed, but it may also introduce latency in the write path."
