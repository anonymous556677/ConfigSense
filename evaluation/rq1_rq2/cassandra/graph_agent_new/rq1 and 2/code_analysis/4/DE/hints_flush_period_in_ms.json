    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The configuration 'hints_flush_period_in_ms' is used to determine how often hints should be flushed from the internal buffers to disk. This is done by scheduling a task to flush the buffer pool at fixed intervals specified by the value of 'hints_flush_period_in_ms'.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The configuration is triggered in the system by scheduling a task with a fixed delay specified by the value of 'hints_flush_period_in_ms'. This means that the flushing of hints from the internal buffers to disk occurs at regular intervals determined by the value of 'hints_flush_period_in_ms'.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the 'hints_flush_period_in_ms' configuration option on the system is that it determines how often hints are persisted to disk. A smaller value for 'hints_flush_period_in_ms' will result in more frequent flushing of hints to disk, potentially increasing disk I/O operations. On the other hand, a larger value for 'hints_flush_period_in_ms' will result in less frequent flushing of hints to disk, which may lead to a higher memory usage in the internal buffers."
