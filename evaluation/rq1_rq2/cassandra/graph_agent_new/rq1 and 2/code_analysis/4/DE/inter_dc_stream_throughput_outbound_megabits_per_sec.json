    "config_description": "Throttles all streaming file transfer between the datacenters, this setting allows users to throttle inter dc stream throughput in addition to throttling all network stream traffic as configured with stream_throughput_outbound_megabits_per_sec When unset, the default is 200 Mbps or 25 MB/s",
    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The configuration 'inter_dc_stream_throughput_outbound_megabits_per_sec' is used to throttle all streaming file transfer between the datacenters. It allows users to throttle inter dc stream throughput in addition to throttling all network stream traffic as configured with 'stream_throughput_outbound_megabits_per_sec'. The code provided includes methods to set and get the value of this configuration, as well as a method to calculate the inter DC rate in bytes based on the configured throughput.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The configuration is triggered whenever the 'setInterDCStreamThroughputMbPerSec' method is called to set a new value for the inter DC stream throughput. This could happen whenever a user or system administrator decides to change the throttling settings for inter DC stream throughput.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the 'inter_dc_stream_throughput_outbound_megabits_per_sec' configuration option is significant as it directly affects the rate at which data is transferred between datacenters. Setting a lower value for this configuration can limit the throughput between datacenters, potentially affecting the overall performance of the system in terms of data replication and synchronization. On the other hand, setting a higher value could potentially saturate the network links between datacenters, leading to congestion and potential performance degradation."
