    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The 'commit_failure_policy' configuration is used to determine the action to take when a commit error occurs. The code snippet provided shows that when a commit error is encountered, the system inspects the commit log error and then checks the commit failure policy set in the configuration. Depending on the policy (die, stop, stop_commit, ignore), different actions are taken such as stopping transports, logging error messages, or killing the JVM.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The triggering frequency of the 'commit_failure_policy' configuration depends on the occurrence of commit errors in the system. The configuration is triggered whenever a commit error is encountered during the processing of the commit log.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the 'commit_failure_policy' configuration option on the system is significant as it determines the behavior of the system when commit errors occur. Depending on the policy set, the system may shut down, stop certain operations, or ignore errors. This can affect the availability and reliability of the system in handling commit failures."
