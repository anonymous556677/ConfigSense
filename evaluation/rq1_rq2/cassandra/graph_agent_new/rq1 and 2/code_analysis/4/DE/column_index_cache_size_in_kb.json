This means that only partition information is held on heap and the index entries are read from disk.  Note that this size refers to the size of the serialized index information and not the size of the partition.",
    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The configuration 'column_index_cache_size_in_kb' is used to determine the size limit for sstable indexed key cache entries. Entries exceeding this size will not be held on heap, meaning only partition information is held on heap and index entries are read from disk.",

Setting a higher value may increase memory usage but improve performance by keeping more entries in memory, while setting a lower value may reduce memory usage but increase disk reads for index entries."
