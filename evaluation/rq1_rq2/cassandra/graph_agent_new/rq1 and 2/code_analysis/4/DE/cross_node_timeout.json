If disabled, replicas will assume that requests were forwarded to them instantly by the coordinator, which means that under overload conditions we will waste that much extra time processing already-timed-out requests.  Warning: It is generally assumed that users have setup NTP on their clusters, and that clocks are modestly in sync, since this is a requirement for general correctness of last write wins.",
    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The configuration 'cross_node_timeout' is checked in the method getExpiresAtNanos to determine if operation timeout information exchange between nodes should be enabled. If the DatabaseDescriptor hasCrossNodeTimeout() returns false or the createdAtNanos is greater than the currentTimeNanos, the createdAtNanos is set to the currentTimeNanos. The method then returns the sum of createdAtNanos and expirationPeriodNanos.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The triggering frequency of the 'cross_node_timeout' configuration depends on the frequency of calls to the getExpiresAtNanos method in the system. This would vary based on the frequency of operations that require timeout information exchange between nodes.",

If disabled, replicas will assume that requests were forwarded instantly by the coordinator, potentially leading to wasted processing time for already-timed-out requests under overload conditions. It is crucial for the correctness and efficiency of the system to have this configuration enabled, assuming that users have synchronized clocks through NTP for general correctness of last write wins."
