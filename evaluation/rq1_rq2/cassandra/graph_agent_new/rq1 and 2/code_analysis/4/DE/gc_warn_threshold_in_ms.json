The frequency of triggering depends on the frequency of GC events and the duration of the pauses.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the 'gc_warn_threshold_in_ms' configuration option on the system is that it can affect the logging behavior of GC pauses. Setting a higher threshold may result in fewer warnings being logged, potentially missing important performance issues. On the other hand, setting a lower threshold may increase the volume of warnings logged, potentially impacting system performance due to increased logging overhead."
