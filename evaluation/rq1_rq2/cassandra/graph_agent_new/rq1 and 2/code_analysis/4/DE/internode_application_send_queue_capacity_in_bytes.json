    "config_description": "Global, per-endpoint and per-connection limits imposed on messages queued for delivery to other nodes and waiting to be processed on arrival from other nodes in the cluster.  These limits are applied to the on-wire size of the message being sent or received.  The basic per-link limit is consumed in isolation before any endpoint or global limit is imposed. Each node-pair has three links: urgent, small and large.  So any given node may have a maximum of N*3*(internode_application_send_queue_capacity_in_bytes+internode_application_receive_queue_capacity_in_bytes) messages queued without any coordination between them although in practice, with token-aware routing, only RF*tokens nodes should need to communicate with significant bandwidth.  The per-endpoint limit is imposed on all messages exceeding the per-link limit, simultaneously with the global limit, on all links to or from a single node in the cluster. The global limit is imposed on all messages exceeding the per-link limit, simultaneously with the per-endpoint limit, on all links to or from any node in the cluster. ",
    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The configuration code retrieves the application send queue capacity in bytes. It first checks if the value is not null, then returns the value. If the value is null, it retrieves the value from the DatabaseDescriptor.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The configuration is triggered whenever the application needs to send messages to other nodes in the cluster. The triggering frequency depends on the volume of messages being sent and the size of the application send queue capacity in bytes.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The configuration option 'internode_application_send_queue_capacity_in_bytes' impacts the system by setting limits on the messages queued for delivery to other nodes and waiting to be processed on arrival from other nodes. It helps in managing the on-wire size of the messages being sent or received, and ensures that the system does not get overwhelmed with queued messages. By setting appropriate values for this configuration, the system can maintain efficient communication and prevent overload."
