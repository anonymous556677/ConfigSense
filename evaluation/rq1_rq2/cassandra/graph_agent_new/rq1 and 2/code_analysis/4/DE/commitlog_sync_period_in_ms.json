    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The configuration 'commitlog_sync_period_in_ms' is used in the code to determine the periodic commit log sync block time. If the 'periodic_commitlog_sync_lag_block_in_ms' configuration value is not set, the block time is calculated as 1.5 times the commit log sync period. If the value is set, the block time is taken as the configured value.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The triggering frequency of the 'commitlog_sync_period_in_ms' configuration depends on how often the periodic commit log sync operation is called in the system. This could vary based on the workload and data changes in the system.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the 'commitlog_sync_period_in_ms' configuration option is significant as it determines the block time for periodic commit log sync. A longer block time may delay the sync process and impact data consistency and durability, while a shorter block time may increase the overhead on the system. It is important to tune this configuration based on the system requirements and workload."
