    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The configuration 'max_hints_file_size_in_mb' is used to set the maximum size for a single hints file in megabytes. In the provided code snippet, the value of 'maxHintsFileSize' is retrieved using 'DatabaseDescriptor.getMaxHintsFileSize()' and is used to determine when to break the session loop based on the size of the hints file being written.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The triggering frequency of the 'max_hints_file_size_in_mb' configuration depends on the size of the hints file being written. Whenever the session position exceeds the configured maximum size, the loop breaks, triggering the configuration check.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the 'max_hints_file_size_in_mb' configuration option is that it limits the size of a single hints file, preventing it from growing beyond the specified limit. This helps in managing the size of hints files and prevents them from becoming too large, which could potentially impact the performance and storage capacity of the system."
