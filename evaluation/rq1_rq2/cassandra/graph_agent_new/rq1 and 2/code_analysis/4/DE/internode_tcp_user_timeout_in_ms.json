The amount of time to wait for internode tcp connections to establish. internode_tcp_connect_timeout_in_ms: 2000  The amount of time unacknowledged data is allowed on a connection before we throw out the connection Note this is only supported on Linux + epoll, and it appears to behave oddly above a setting of 30000 (it takes much longer than 30s) as of Linux 4.12. If you want something that high set this to 0 which picks up the OS default and configure the net.ipv4.tcp_retries2 sysctl to be ~8.",
    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The configuration 'internode_tcp_user_timeout_in_ms' is used in the code to set the amount of time to wait for internode tcp connections to establish. The method tcpUserTimeoutInMS(ConnectionCategory category) checks if the tcpUserTimeoutInMS value is not null, it returns that value. Otherwise, it returns different values based on the connection category (MESSAGING or STREAMING) by calling DatabaseDescriptor.getInternodeTcpUserTimeoutInMS() or DatabaseDescriptor.getInternodeStreamingTcpUserTimeoutInMS().",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The triggering frequency of the 'internode_tcp_user_timeout_in_ms' configuration depends on how often new internode tcp connections are established in the system. If new connections are frequently established, this configuration will be triggered more often.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the 'internode_tcp_user_timeout_in_ms' configuration option is significant for protecting Cassandra from true network partitions. It determines the amount of time allowed for internode tcp connections to establish, which can affect the overall performance and reliability of the system. Setting this value too low may result in connection timeouts, while setting it too high may lead to longer connection establishment times."
