    "config_description": "Global, per-endpoint and per-connection limits imposed on messages queued for delivery to other nodes and waiting to be processed on arrival from other nodes in the cluster.  These limits are applied to the on-wire size of the message being sent or received.  The basic per-link limit is consumed in isolation before any endpoint or global limit is imposed. Each node-pair has three links: urgent, small and large.  So any given node may have a maximum of N*3*(internode_application_send_queue_capacity_in_bytes+internode_application_receive_queue_capacity_in_bytes) messages queued without any coordination between them although in practice, with token-aware routing, only RF*tokens nodes should need to communicate with significant bandwidth.  The per-endpoint limit is imposed on all messages exceeding the per-link limit, simultaneously with the global limit, on all links to or from a single node in the cluster. The global limit is imposed on all messages exceeding the per-link limit, simultaneously with the per-endpoint limit, on all links to or from any node in the cluster.  internode_application_send_queue_capacity_in_bytes: 4194304                       #4MiB internode_application_send_queue_reserve_endpoint_capacity_in_bytes: 134217728    #128MiB",
    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The configuration 'internode_application_send_queue_reserve_global_capacity_in_bytes' sets global, per-endpoint, and per-connection limits on messages queued for delivery between nodes in the cluster. These limits are applied to the on-wire size of the message being sent or received. The configuration is used to control the amount of queued messages and ensure efficient message processing and delivery.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The configuration is triggered when messages are queued for delivery between nodes in the cluster. The frequency of triggering depends on the volume of messages being sent and received, as well as the size of the messages. The configuration is enforced whenever messages exceed the specified limits set by the configuration.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The configuration option 'internode_application_send_queue_reserve_global_capacity_in_bytes' impacts the system by controlling the amount of memory allocated for queued messages. Setting this configuration too low may result in message queue overflow and potential message loss, while setting it too high may lead to increased memory usage and potential performance degradation. It is important to tune this configuration based on the expected message volume and system resources to ensure optimal performance."
