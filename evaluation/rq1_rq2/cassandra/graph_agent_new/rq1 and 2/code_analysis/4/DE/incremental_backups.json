    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The 'incremental_backups' configuration is checked in the maybeIncrementallyBackup method to determine if incremental backups are enabled. If enabled, it creates hard links to each SSTable flushed or streamed locally in a backups/ subdirectory of the keyspace data.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The triggering frequency of the 'incremental_backups' configuration depends on the frequency of SSTable flushes or streams in the system. Whenever a new SSTable is created or streamed, the maybeIncrementallyBackup method is called to potentially create incremental backups.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of enabling the 'incremental_backups' configuration is that it creates hard links to SSTables, which can consume additional disk space. However, it provides a way to have incremental backups without duplicating the data, which can be useful for backup and restore operations."
