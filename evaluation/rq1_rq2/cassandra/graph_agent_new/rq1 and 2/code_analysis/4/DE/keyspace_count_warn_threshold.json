The frequency of triggering depends on how often keyspaces are added or removed in the cluster.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of setting a keyspace count warning threshold is to alert users when the number of keyspaces in the cluster exceeds a certain limit. This is important because having a large number of keyspaces can significantly slow down schema-dependent cluster operations, affecting overall performance."
