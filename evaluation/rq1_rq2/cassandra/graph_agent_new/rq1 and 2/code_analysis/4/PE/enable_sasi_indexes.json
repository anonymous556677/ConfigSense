    "Reason": "The configuration option 'enable_sasi_indexes' is not performance-sensitive based on the provided code context. The code snippet does not contain any performance-related operations that are time-expensive or memory-expensive. The configuration check for 'DatabaseDescriptor.getEnableSASIIndexes()' is a simple boolean check and does not involve any complex or resource-intensive operations. Additionally, the code snippet mainly focuses on validation and metadata handling, which does not directly impact system performance at a notable level."
