    "classification_result": "Performance-insensitive with 100% confidence",
    "Reason": "The partitioner configuration option is related to distributing rows across nodes in the cluster based on a partition key. Changing the partitioner requires reloading all data and should not be done for new clusters. This configuration does not directly impact system performance or involve time-dependent aspects of system operation."
