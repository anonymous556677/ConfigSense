    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'cas_contention_timeout_in_ms' is performance-sensitive. The code context provided shows that this configuration directly impacts the retry logic for CAS operations in a Paxos session. The 'CASContentionTimeout' configuration determines how long the system will continue to retry CAS operations that contend with other proposals. This timeout directly affects the performance of the system by influencing the duration of retries and potentially impacting the overall execution time. Therefore, the configuration is performance-sensitive as it involves time-expensive operations that can lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
