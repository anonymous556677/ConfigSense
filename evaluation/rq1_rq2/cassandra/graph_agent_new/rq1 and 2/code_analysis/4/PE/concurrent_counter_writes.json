    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'concurrent_counter_writes' is performance-sensitive. The 'CounterMutation' class contains methods like 'applyCounterMutation', 'grabCounterLocks', 'updateWithCurrentValuesFromCache', 'updateWithCurrentValuesFromCFS', which involve time-expensive and memory-expensive operations like acquiring locks, reading values, and updating counters. These operations directly impact system performance at the system level by introducing notable performance variations. Therefore, the configuration is considered performance-sensitive."
