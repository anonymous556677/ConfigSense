    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'file_cache_enabled' is performance-sensitive. The 'file_cache_enabled' configuration directly affects the system's performance by determining whether the sstable chunk cache is enabled or not. This configuration is crucial as it influences the creation and usage of the ChunkCache instance, which in turn impacts memory consumption and execution time at the system level. Additionally, the 'enabled' flag is used to conditionally instantiate the ChunkCache instance based on the value of 'file_cache_enabled', indicating a direct relationship between this configuration and performance-related operations within the code."
