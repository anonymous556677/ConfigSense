    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The 'role_manager' configuration option is not performance-sensitive. The configuration-related code primarily deals with authentication, authorization, and role management, which are essential for security and access control but do not directly impact system performance. The code snippets provided focus on validating user permissions, setting up authentication mechanisms, and handling user roles, which are crucial for security but do not involve time-expensive or memory-expensive operations that would significantly impact system performance."
