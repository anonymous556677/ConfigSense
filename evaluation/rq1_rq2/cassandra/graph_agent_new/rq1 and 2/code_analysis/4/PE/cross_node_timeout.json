    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'cross_node_timeout' is performance-sensitive. The code context shows that the 'cross_node_timeout' configuration directly influences the behavior of the method 'hasCrossNodeTimeout', which in turn affects the operation timeout information exchange between nodes. This operation is crucial for system performance as it determines whether replicas will assume forwarded requests instantly or not. Therefore, any changes in the 'cross_node_timeout' configuration can lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
