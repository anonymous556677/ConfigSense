    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'internode_application_send_queue_reserve_endpoint_capacity_in_bytes' is performance-sensitive. This is because the code snippet provided involves retrieving the value of this configuration parameter and using it to set the applicationReserveSendQueueEndpointCapacityInBytes, which directly impacts the capacity of messages queued for delivery to other nodes in the cluster. Any changes in this configuration parameter can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, making it performance-sensitive."
