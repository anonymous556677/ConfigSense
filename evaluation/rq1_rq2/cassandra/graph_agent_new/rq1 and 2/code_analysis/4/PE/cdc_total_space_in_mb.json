    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'cdc_total_space_in_mb' is classified as performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the 'cdc_total_space_in_mb' configuration directly affects the amount of space allocated for change-data-capture logs on disk. The code snippet provided shows that this configuration is multiplied by 1024 * 1024, indicating that it has a direct impact on memory consumption. Additionally, the method getCDCSpaceInMB() retrieves this configuration value for further processing, suggesting that it plays a crucial role in the performance of the system at the system level."
