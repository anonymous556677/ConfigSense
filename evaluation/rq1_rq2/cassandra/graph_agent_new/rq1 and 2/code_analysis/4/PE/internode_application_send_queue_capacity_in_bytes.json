    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'internode_application_send_queue_capacity_in_bytes' is performance-sensitive. The code context shows that this configuration directly impacts the application's send queue capacity, which can have a significant effect on system performance. The method 'applicationSendQueueCapacityInBytes' retrieves the value of this configuration, and if it is not set, it falls back to a default value from 'DatabaseDescriptor'. This configuration is crucial for managing the application's communication and can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, making it performance-sensitive."
