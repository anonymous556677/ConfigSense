    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'column_index_cache_size_in_kb' is performance-sensitive. The code context shows that this configuration directly impacts the size of the column index cache, which can have a significant effect on system performance. The method 'getColumnIndexCacheSize' retrieves this configuration parameter, indicating that it is crucial for determining the cache size. Since the size of the cache can affect memory consumption and query performance, any changes to this configuration can lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
