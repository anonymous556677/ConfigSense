    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'initial_token' configuration option is performance-sensitive. This is because the 'initial_token' configuration directly impacts the token generation process in the system, which is crucial for the performance of the distributed system. The code snippet provided shows that the 'initial_token' configuration is used to determine the tokens to be used for bootstrap operations. Depending on the presence of 'initial_tokens' and 'allocationKeyspace', different token generation strategies are employed, which can significantly affect the performance of the system. Therefore, the 'initial_token' configuration involves performance-related operations that are time-expensive and memory-expensive, leading to notable performance variations at the system level."
