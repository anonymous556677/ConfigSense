{
    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'tracetype_query_ttl' is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the 'Tracing' class contains methods and operations that directly impact system performance at the system level. For example, the 'traceOutgoingMessage' method performs tracing data capture for outbound messages, which can be time-expensive and memory-expensive. Additionally, the 'newSession' method creates new trace sessions, which involve memory-intensive operations like creating new objects and adding them to a ConcurrentHashMap. These operations contribute to notable performance variations at the system level, making the 'tracetype_query_ttl' configuration performance-sensitive."
