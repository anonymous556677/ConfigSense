    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'native_transport_max_threads' is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the 'native_transport_max_threads' configuration directly impacts the number of threads allocated for handling native transport requests. The code snippet provided initializes an executor service with the value of 'DatabaseDescriptor.getNativeTransportMaxThreads()', which indicates that this configuration setting controls the number of threads used for processing native transport requests. Since the number of threads directly affects the concurrency and performance of handling incoming requests, any changes to this configuration can lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
