    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'network_authorizer' configuration is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the 'networkAuthCache' instance is created using 'DatabaseDescriptor.getNetworkAuthorizer()', which involves performance-related operations that are time-expensive and memory-expensive. Additionally, the 'hasLocalAccess()' method directly accesses the 'networkAuthCache' to check if the user has local access, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Therefore, the configuration directly and substantially affects system performance, making it performance-sensitive."
