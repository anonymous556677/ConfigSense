    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'streaming_connections_per_host' is performance-sensitive. This is because the 'streaming_connections_per_host' parameter directly impacts the number of connections per host for streaming operations. The code context shows that this parameter is used in the 'bootstrap' and 'rebuild' methods, which are critical for data streaming and rebuilding processes in the system. Adjusting this parameter can have a notable performance impact on the system level by affecting the efficiency of streaming operations and data transfer rates."
