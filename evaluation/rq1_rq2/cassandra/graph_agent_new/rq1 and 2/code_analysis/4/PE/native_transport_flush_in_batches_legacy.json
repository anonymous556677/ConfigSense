    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option native_transport_flush_in_batches_legacy is performance-sensitive. The method useNativeTransportLegacyFlusher() directly accesses this configuration parameter to determine whether to use native transport TCP message coalescing. This configuration can impact throughput and is recommended for evaluation if throughput decreases after upgrading to version 4.0. Since the configuration directly affects network communication and potentially throughput, it can lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
