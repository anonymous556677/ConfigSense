    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'allocate_tokens_for_local_replication_factor' is performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration involves operations that directly impact system performance, such as token allocation and token generation. The code snippet provided shows that the configuration determines token allocation based on specified keyspace or local replication factor, which can significantly affect the performance of the system by influencing data distribution and replication. Additionally, the configuration includes time-expensive operations like token allocation and token generation, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
