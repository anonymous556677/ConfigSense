    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'enable_transient_replication' is performance-sensitive. This is because the 'hasTransientReplicas()' method in the code context directly checks if transient replicas are enabled and if not, throws a ConfigurationException. This operation is time-expensive and can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Additionally, the 'isTransientReplicationEnabled()' method from DatabaseDescriptor is called to determine if transient replication is enabled, which involves accessing configuration settings and can have a significant impact on system performance."
