    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'enable_user_defined_functions' is performance-sensitive. This is because the 'assertUdfsEnabled' method checks if user-defined functions are enabled in cassandra.yaml by calling 'DatabaseDescriptor.enableUserDefinedFunctions()'. If user-defined functions are disabled, an exception is thrown. This configuration directly affects the system performance by enabling or disabling user-defined functions, which can have a significant impact on the execution time and memory consumption of the system."
