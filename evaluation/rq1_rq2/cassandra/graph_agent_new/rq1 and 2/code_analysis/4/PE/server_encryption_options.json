{
    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'server_encryption_options' is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the 'server_encryption_options' configuration involves performance-related operations that are time-expensive and memory-expensive within the related code. Specifically, the creation of SSL contexts, handling of SSL certificates, and setting up client SSL connections are all operations that have a notable performance impact at the system level. These operations directly affect system performance and can lead to significant performance variations, making the 'server_encryption_options' configuration performance-sensitive."
