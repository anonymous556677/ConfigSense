    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'native_transport_max_frame_size_in_mb' is performance-sensitive. This is because the 'native_transport_max_frame_size_in_mb' configuration directly affects the maximum total length of the message envelope in the system. The 'MAX_TOTAL_LENGTH' constant in the 'Decoder' class is set based on this configuration, and if the total length exceeds this value, it triggers a discarding mechanism that impacts system performance. Additionally, the 'decode' method in the 'Decoder' class performs operations that are time-expensive and memory-expensive, contributing to notable performance variations at the system level."
