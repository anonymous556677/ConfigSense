    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'max_hints_delivery_threads' is performance-sensitive. This is because the 'maxDeliveryThreads' variable directly influences the number of threads used for delivering hints in the HintsService class. The number of delivery threads can significantly impact the performance of hint delivery operations, especially in scenarios with high load or multi-data center deployments. Therefore, any changes to this configuration can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, making it a performance-sensitive configuration."
