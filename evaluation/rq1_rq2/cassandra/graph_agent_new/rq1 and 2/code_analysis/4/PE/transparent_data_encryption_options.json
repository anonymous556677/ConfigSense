    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'transparent_data_encryption_options' is not performance-sensitive. The code related to this configuration does not contain any performance-related operations that are time-expensive or memory-expensive. The configuration mainly deals with creating and handling encryption components, reading commit log segments, and handling CDC replay completion, which do not directly and substantially affect system performance at the system level."
