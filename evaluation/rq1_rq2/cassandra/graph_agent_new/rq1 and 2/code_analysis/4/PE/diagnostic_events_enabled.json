{
    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'diagnostic_events_enabled' is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the 'diagnostic_events_enabled' configuration directly affects the system performance at the system level. The code context provided shows that the 'diagnostic_events_enabled' configuration is checked multiple times in performance-related operations such as publishing events and checking if events are enabled. These operations are time-expensive and directly impact the system performance. Therefore, the configuration is considered performance-sensitive."
