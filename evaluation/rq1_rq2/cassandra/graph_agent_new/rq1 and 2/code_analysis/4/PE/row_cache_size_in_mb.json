    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'row_cache_size_in_mb' is performance-sensitive. The code context shows that the value of 'row_cache_size_in_mb' directly influences the capacity of the row cache in memory, which can have a significant impact on system performance. The configuration-related code involves memory-expensive operations like setting cache capacity based on the value of 'row_cache_size_in_mb'. Any changes to this configuration can lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
