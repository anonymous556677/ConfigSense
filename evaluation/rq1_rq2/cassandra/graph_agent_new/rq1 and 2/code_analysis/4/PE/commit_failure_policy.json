    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'commit_failure_policy' configuration is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the 'handleCommitError' method contains code that switches based on the 'commit_failure_policy' configuration, which directly impacts the behavior of the system. Depending on the value of 'commit_failure_policy', different actions are taken that can have a notable performance impact, such as stopping transports or terminating threads. These performance-related operations within the code contribute to significant performance variations at the system level."
