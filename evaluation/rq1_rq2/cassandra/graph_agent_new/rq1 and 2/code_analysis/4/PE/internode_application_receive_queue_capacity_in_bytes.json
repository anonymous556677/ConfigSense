    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'internode_application_receive_queue_capacity_in_bytes' is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the configuration directly affects the system's performance at the system level. The code context shows that the 'applicationReceiveQueueCapacityInBytes' configuration parameter is being checked against a minimum value, and if it does not meet the minimum requirement, an exception is thrown. This indicates that the configuration has a direct impact on the system's behavior and performance. Additionally, the configuration involves performance-related operations such as socket buffer size checks and application queue capacity checks, which are time-expensive and memory-expensive operations that can lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
