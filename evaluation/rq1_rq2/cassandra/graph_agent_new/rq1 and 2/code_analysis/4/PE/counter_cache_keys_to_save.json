    "classification_result": "Performance-insensitive with 100% confidence",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'Number of keys from the counter cache to save' is related to saving keys in the counter cache, which is not a performance-sensitive operation. It does not involve any performance-related operations or affect system performance, and is unrelated to any time-dependent aspects of system operation."
