    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'ideal_consistency_level' is performance-sensitive. The ideal consistency level directly affects the behavior of the system's write response handling, as seen in the code context provided. The 'ideal_consistency_level' configuration parameter is used to determine the consistency level for tracking purposes in the write response handling logic. Depending on the comparison with the replica plan's consistency level, different response handlers are constructed, impacting the execution time and memory consumption of write operations. Therefore, changes in the 'ideal_consistency_level' configuration can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, making it performance-sensitive."
