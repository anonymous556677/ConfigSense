    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'inter_dc_stream_throughput_outbound_megabits_per_sec' is classified as performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly affects the inter-DC stream throughput in megabits per second, which in turn impacts the system's data transfer rate between data centers. The code context provided shows that changing this configuration triggers the update of the inter-DC throughput and calculates the rate in bytes based on the configured throughput value. These operations are time-expensive and memory-expensive, leading to notable performance variations at the system level."
