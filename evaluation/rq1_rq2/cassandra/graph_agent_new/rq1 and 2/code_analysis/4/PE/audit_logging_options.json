    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'audit_logging_options' configuration is performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly affects the system performance by enabling or disabling audit logging, which involves operations that can be time-expensive and memory-expensive. The code snippets related to the 'audit_logging_options' configuration show that it initializes audit logging options, creates audit loggers, and enables audit logging based on various parameters. These operations can have a notable performance impact at the system level, especially when audit logging is enabled with additional parameters such as included keyspaces, excluded keyspaces, etc. Therefore, the 'audit_logging_options' configuration is considered performance-sensitive."
