    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'repaired_data_tracking_for_range_reads_enabled' is performance-sensitive. The code snippet provided shows that this configuration directly affects the behavior of the 'query' method, where it determines whether repaired data tracking for range reads is enabled. This tracking involves additional operations that can impact the performance of range reads significantly, especially when there are multiple full replicas to compare results from. Therefore, enabling or disabling this configuration can lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
