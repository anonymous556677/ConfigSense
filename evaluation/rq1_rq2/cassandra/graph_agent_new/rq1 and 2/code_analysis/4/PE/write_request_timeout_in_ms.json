{
    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'write_request_timeout_in_ms' is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the 'write_request_timeout_in_ms' configuration directly affects the performance of write operations in the system. The 'write_request_timeout_in_ms' configuration is used in various methods like 'applyInternal' to determine the timeout for write operations. The timeout value impacts the overall performance of write operations by setting a limit on how long a write operation can take before timing out. This directly affects the system performance at the system level by controlling the time taken for write operations to complete, making it a performance-sensitive configuration."
