{
    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'sstable_preemptive_open_interval_in_mb' is performance-sensitive. The code context shows that this configuration directly affects the calculation of the open interval for SSTables, which is a critical operation in the system. The method 'calculateOpenInterval' uses this configuration to determine the interval, and any changes in the value of 'sstable_preemptive_open_interval_in_mb' can lead to significant performance variations at the system level. Additionally, the method 'getSSTablePreemptiveOpenIntervalInMB' retrieves the value of this configuration, indicating its importance in system performance."
