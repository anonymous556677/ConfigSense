    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'allocate_tokens_for_keyspace' is performance-sensitive. This is because the 'allocateTokens' method is called based on the value of 'allocationKeyspace' which directly affects the token allocation algorithm and the number of tokens generated. The allocation of tokens is a time-expensive operation that can significantly impact system performance at the system level. Additionally, the code snippet checks for various conditions and configurations before deciding on the token allocation strategy, indicating that the configuration is crucial for performance optimization."
