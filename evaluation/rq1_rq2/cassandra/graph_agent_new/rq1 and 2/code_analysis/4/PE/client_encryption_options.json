{
    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'client_encryption_options' is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the 'SSLFactory' class contains methods that involve creating and managing SSL contexts, which are time-expensive and memory-expensive operations. These operations directly impact system performance at the system level, especially considering the creation and caching of SSL contexts in the 'SSLFactory' class. Additionally, the 'SSLFactory' class deals with SSL certificates, hot reloading, and validation, all of which are performance-sensitive operations that can lead to notable performance variations."
