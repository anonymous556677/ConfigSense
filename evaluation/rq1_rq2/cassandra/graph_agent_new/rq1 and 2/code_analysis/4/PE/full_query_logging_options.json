    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'full_query_logging_options' is classified as performance-sensitive. This classification is based on the fact that the 'getFullQueryLoggerOptions' method involves retrieving and setting various options related to full query logging, which can have a direct impact on system performance. The method 'enableFullQueryLogger' also involves setting multiple parameters that can affect performance, such as log size, queue weight, and archive retries. These operations contribute to notable performance variations at the system level, making the configuration performance-sensitive."
