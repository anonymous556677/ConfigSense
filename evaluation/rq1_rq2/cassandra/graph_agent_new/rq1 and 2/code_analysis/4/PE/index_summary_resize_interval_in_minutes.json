    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'index_summary_resize_interval_in_minutes' is performance-sensitive. This is because the value of 'index_summary_resize_interval_in_minutes' directly affects the resize interval of the index summary manager, which in turn impacts the memory usage and execution time of the system. The code context shows that this configuration parameter is used to set the resize interval of the index summary manager, which can have a notable performance impact on the system level."
