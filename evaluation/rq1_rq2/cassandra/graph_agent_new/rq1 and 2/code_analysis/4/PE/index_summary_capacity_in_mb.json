    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'index_summary_capacity_in_mb' is classified as performance-sensitive. The code context provided shows that the configuration setting directly affects the memory pool size for index summaries, which can have a significant impact on system performance. The method 'getIndexSummaryCapacityInMB()' is used to retrieve this configuration value, indicating that it plays a crucial role in determining memory consumption. Therefore, any changes to this configuration can lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
