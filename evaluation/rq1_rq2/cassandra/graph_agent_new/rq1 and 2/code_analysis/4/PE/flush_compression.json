    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'flush_compression' is classified as performance-sensitive. The code context provided shows that the 'flush_compression' configuration directly impacts the compression algorithm used during the flushing process of SSTables. The choice of compression algorithm can significantly affect the throughput of the system during flushes, especially for large tables, potentially blocking writes. The code snippet includes a switch statement that changes the compressionParams based on the value of 'DatabaseDescriptor.getFlushCompression()', indicating that different compression algorithms can be applied. This dynamic selection of compression algorithm based on the configuration setting directly affects system performance at the system level, making it performance-sensitive."
