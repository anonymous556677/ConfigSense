{
    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'internode_tcp_connect_timeout_in_ms' is classified as performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the 'tcpConnectTimeoutInMS' method directly returns the value of 'tcpConnectTimeoutInMS' if it is not null, otherwise it retrieves the value from 'DatabaseDescriptor.getInternodeTcpConnectTimeoutInMS()'. This configuration involves performance-related operations that can have a notable impact on system performance, as it directly affects the timeout duration for internode TCP connections. Changes in this configuration can lead to significant performance variations at the system level."
