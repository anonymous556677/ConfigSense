    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'streaming_keep_alive_period_in_secs' is performance-sensitive. The code context provided shows that this configuration directly affects the scheduling of keep-alive tasks in the system. The value of 'streaming_keep_alive_period_in_secs' is retrieved from the configuration file and used in the code to schedule keep-alive tasks at fixed intervals. Changing this configuration can directly impact the system's performance by affecting the frequency of keep-alive tasks, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
