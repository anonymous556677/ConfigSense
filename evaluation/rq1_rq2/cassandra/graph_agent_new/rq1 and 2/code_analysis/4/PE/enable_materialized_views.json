    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'enable_materialized_views' is not performance-sensitive. The code related to this configuration does not involve any performance-related operations that are time-expensive or memory-expensive. The code mainly focuses on validation and processing of data related to materialized views, which does not directly and substantially affect system performance at the system level. Therefore, the configuration can be classified as not performance-sensitive."
