{
    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'internode_tcp_user_timeout_in_ms' is classified as performance-sensitive. This is because the 'tcpUserTimeoutInMS' method directly returns the 'internode_tcp_user_timeout_in_ms' value based on the connection category, which can have a notable impact on system performance. The method involves accessing the 'internode_tcp_user_timeout_in_ms' value from the DatabaseDescriptor, which indicates a direct relationship between the configuration and system performance. Additionally, the method is time-expensive as it involves conditional checks and value retrieval, which can contribute to performance variations at the system level."
