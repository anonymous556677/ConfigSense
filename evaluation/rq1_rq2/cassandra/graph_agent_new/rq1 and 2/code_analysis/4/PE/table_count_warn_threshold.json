{
    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'table_count_warn_threshold' is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the 'table_count_warn_threshold' configuration directly affects the system performance at the system level. The code context provided shows that if the number of tables exceeds the 'table_count_warn_threshold', it will significantly slow down schema-dependent cluster operations, leading to notable performance variations. Additionally, the 'tableCountWarnThreshold' method retrieves the 'table_count_warn_threshold' value from the configuration, indicating a direct relationship between the configuration and performance impact."
