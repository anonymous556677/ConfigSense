    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'key_cache_size_in_mb' is performance-sensitive. The code context provided initializes the key cache with a capacity specified in megabytes. The keyCacheInMemoryCapacity calculation based on the key cache size in MB indicates a memory-expensive operation. The size of the key cache directly impacts the memory consumption of the system, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Additionally, the method getKeyCacheSizeInMB is directly related to retrieving the key cache size in megabytes, further emphasizing the performance sensitivity of this configuration."
