    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'file_cache_size_in_mb' is performance-sensitive. The 'file_cache_size_in_mb' configuration directly impacts the calculation of the 'cacheSize' in the 'ChunkCache' class, which is used to determine the maximum weight for the cache. The 'cacheSize' calculation involves a time-expensive operation that can significantly affect system performance by determining the amount of memory allocated for caching. Any changes to 'file_cache_size_in_mb' will have a notable performance variation at the system level due to its direct influence on memory consumption within the cache. Therefore, the configuration is considered performance-sensitive based on its impact on memory usage and cache size calculation."
