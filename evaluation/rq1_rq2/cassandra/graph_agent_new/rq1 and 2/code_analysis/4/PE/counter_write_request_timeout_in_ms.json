    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'counter_write_request_timeout_in_ms' is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the 'counter_write_request_timeout_in_ms' configuration directly affects the timeout values used in various RPC operations within the code context provided. These timeout values are crucial for the performance of the system as they determine the maximum time allowed for certain operations to complete. Any changes in the 'counter_write_request_timeout_in_ms' configuration can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, making it a performance-sensitive configuration."
