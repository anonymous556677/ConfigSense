    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'cached_rows_warn_threshold' is performance-sensitive. The code context shows that this configuration parameter directly affects the behavior of the system by setting a threshold for the number of rows that can be materialized on-heap during queries. Adjusting this threshold can impact the memory consumption and execution time of the system significantly, leading to notable performance variations at the system level. Additionally, the method 'getCachedReplicaRowsWarnThreshold' retrieves this configuration value, indicating its importance in system performance."
