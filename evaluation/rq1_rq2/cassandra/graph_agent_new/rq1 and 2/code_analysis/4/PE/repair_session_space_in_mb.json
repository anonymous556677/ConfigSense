    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'repair_session_space_in_mb' is performance-sensitive. This is because the 'repair_session_space_in_mb' configuration directly impacts the amount of memory allocated for creating Merkle trees in the 'createMerkleTrees' method. The calculation of 'availableBytes' based on 'DatabaseDescriptor.getRepairSessionSpaceInMegabytes()' affects the memory budget for creating Merkle trees. The memory-intensive operations involved in calculating the 'rangeAvailableBytes' and 'estimatedMaxDepth' based on the 'repair_session_space_in_mb' value contribute significantly to the performance of the system at the memory level. Therefore, any changes in the 'repair_session_space_in_mb' configuration can lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
