    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'stream_entire_sstables' is performance-sensitive. The code context provided shows that this configuration directly impacts the decision to stream entire SSTables based on certain conditions. Streaming entire SSTables can be a time-expensive operation, especially if full SSTable transfers are enabled. This can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, making it a performance-sensitive configuration."
