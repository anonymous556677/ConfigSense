    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'dynamic_snitch_update_interval_in_ms' is performance-sensitive. This is because the 'dynamicUpdateInterval' and 'dynamicResetInterval' values directly affect the scheduling of tasks that involve time-expensive operations (such as 'update' and 'reset') at the system level. These values are dynamically updated based on the configuration changes from DatabaseDescriptor, and the scheduling of tasks with fixed delays in milliseconds can significantly impact the system's performance. Therefore, the configuration involves performance-related operations that are time-extensive within its related code and lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
