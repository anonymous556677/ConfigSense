    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'internode_streaming_tcp_user_timeout_in_ms' is performance-sensitive. This is because the value of 'internode_streaming_tcp_user_timeout_in_ms' directly affects the timeout for processing incoming stream messages in the 'receive' method. If the processing time exceeds the timeout value, a warning is logged and the streaming connection might be closed. This timeout value can have a significant impact on the overall system performance, making it a performance-sensitive configuration."
