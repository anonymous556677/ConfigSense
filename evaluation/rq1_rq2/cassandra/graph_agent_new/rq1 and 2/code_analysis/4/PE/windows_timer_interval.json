    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'windows_timer_interval' is performance-sensitive. The code context reveals that the configuration directly affects the system performance by adjusting the system timer on Windows from the default 15ms down to the minimum of 1ms. This adjustment impacts timer intervals, thread scheduling, driver interrupts, etc., which are time-expensive operations. The method 'getWindowsTimerInterval' retrieves the value of the configuration parameter, indicating its importance in controlling system performance. Therefore, the configuration is considered performance-sensitive as it involves performance-related operations that lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
