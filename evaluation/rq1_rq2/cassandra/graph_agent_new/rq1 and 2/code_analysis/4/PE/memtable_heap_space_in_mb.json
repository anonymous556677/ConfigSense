    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'memtable_heap_space_in_mb' is performance-sensitive. This is because the value of 'memtable_heap_space_in_mb' directly influences the heapLimit used in creating the MemtablePool, which in turn affects the memory consumption of the system. The code snippet provided shows that the value of 'memtable_heap_space_in_mb' is shifted left by 20 to convert it to bytes, indicating a significant impact on memory usage. Additionally, the switch statement based on 'memtableAllocationType' further demonstrates the importance of 'memtable_heap_space_in_mb' in determining the type of memory allocation used, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
