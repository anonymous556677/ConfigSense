    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'concurrent_writes' configuration is performance-sensitive. The configuration involves the use of Striped locks based on the number of concurrent writers, which can directly impact system performance by affecting the concurrency of write operations. The code context shows that the 'prepare', 'propose', and 'commit' methods involve time-expensive operations such as acquiring locks, loading Paxos state, and making mutations, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. These operations contribute significantly to execution time and memory consumption, making the 'concurrent_writes' configuration performance-sensitive."
