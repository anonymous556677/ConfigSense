    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'periodic_commitlog_sync_lag_block_in_ms' is performance-sensitive. This is because the value of 'blockWhenSyncLagsNanos' is calculated based on the configuration value 'DatabaseDescriptor.getPeriodicCommitLogSyncBlock()', which directly affects the expected sync time in the 'maybeWaitForSync' method. The 'maybeWaitForSync' method involves time-expensive operations like calculating 'expectedSyncTime' and waiting for sync, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Therefore, the configuration is considered performance-sensitive."
