    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'stream_throughput_outbound_megabits_per_sec' is classified as performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly affects the outbound stream throughput in megabits per second, which can have a substantial impact on the system's performance. The code context provided shows that changing the value of this configuration triggers the update of the stream throughput and rate limiter, indicating that it plays a crucial role in managing data transfer rates. Additionally, the 'calculateRateInBytes' method demonstrates that the configuration value is used to calculate the rate in bytes, further emphasizing its importance in performance optimization."
