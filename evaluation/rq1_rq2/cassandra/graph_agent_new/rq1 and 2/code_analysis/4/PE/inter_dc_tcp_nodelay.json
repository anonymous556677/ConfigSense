    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'inter_dc_tcp_nodelay' is classified as performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the 'tcpNoDelay' method directly impacts the performance of inter-dc communication by determining whether to enable or disable tcp_nodelay based on the datacenter information. This decision affects the execution time and memory consumption of inter-dc communication, leading to notable performance variations at the system level."
