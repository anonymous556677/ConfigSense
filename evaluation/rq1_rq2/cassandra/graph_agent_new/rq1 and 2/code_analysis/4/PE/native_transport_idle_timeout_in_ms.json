    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'native_transport_idle_timeout_in_ms' is performance-sensitive. The code context shows that this configuration is used to set the idle timeout for client connections in the native transport. Idle connections are closed after the specified timeout, which can have a direct impact on system performance by managing resource utilization. The 'IdleStateHandler' added to the pipeline based on this configuration can lead to notable performance variations at the system level by closing idle connections. Therefore, the configuration involves performance-related operations that are time-expensive and directly affect system performance."
