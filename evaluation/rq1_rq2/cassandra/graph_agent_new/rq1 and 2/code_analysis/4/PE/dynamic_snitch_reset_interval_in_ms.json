    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'dynamic_snitch_reset_interval_in_ms' is performance-sensitive. This is because the 'dynamicResetInterval' configuration parameter directly affects the scheduling of tasks that involve time-expensive operations. The 'reset' method is scheduled to run at fixed intervals based on this configuration, which can have a notable impact on system performance. Additionally, changes to the 'dynamicResetInterval' configuration trigger the cancellation and rescheduling of tasks, indicating a direct and substantial impact on system performance at the system level."
