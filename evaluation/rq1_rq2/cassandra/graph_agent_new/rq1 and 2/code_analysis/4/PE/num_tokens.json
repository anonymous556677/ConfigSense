    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'num_tokens' is performance-sensitive. The method 'validateTransientReplication' contains code that checks the value of 'num_tokens' and throws a ConfigurationException if it is greater than 1. This check directly impacts the system performance by restricting certain operations based on the value of 'num_tokens'. Additionally, the method 'getBootstrapTokens' also uses the value of 'num_tokens' to determine the number of tokens to generate, which can affect the bootstrap process and overall system performance."
