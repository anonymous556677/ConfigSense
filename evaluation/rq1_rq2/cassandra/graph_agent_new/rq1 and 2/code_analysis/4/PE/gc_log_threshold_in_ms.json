{
    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'gc_log_threshold_in_ms' is classified as performance-sensitive. This is because the 'GCInspector' constructor initializes the 'gcStates' map with information about Garbage Collectors, which involves time-expensive operations like querying MBeanServer and creating new PlatformMXBeanProxy. These operations directly impact system performance by consuming memory and execution time. Additionally, the configuration 'gc_log_threshold_in_ms' is related to Garbage Collection logging threshold, which can have a significant impact on system performance based on the code context."
