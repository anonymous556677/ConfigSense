    "classification_result": "Performance-insensitive with 100% confidence",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'Row cache implementation class name' is related to the type of row cache implementation in Cassandra. This configuration does not directly impact system performance as it only specifies the implementation class name for the row cache. Different implementations may have different memory usage or efficiency, but it does not involve any time-dependent aspects or performance-sensitive operations."
