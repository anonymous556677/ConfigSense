    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'max_concurrent_automatic_sstable_upgrades' is performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly limits the number of concurrent sstable upgrades, which can have a significant impact on system performance. The code context shows that this configuration is used to control the number of upgrade tasks that can run concurrently, which can affect the overall system performance by potentially increasing or decreasing the workload on the system. Therefore, any changes to this configuration can lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
