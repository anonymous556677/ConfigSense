    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'keyspace_count_warn_threshold' is performance-sensitive. This is because the value of 'keyspaceCount' is compared to the 'keyspace_count_warn_threshold' retrieved from the configuration file. If the 'keyspaceCount' exceeds the 'keyspace_count_warn_threshold', a warning message is logged, indicating that having a large number of keyspaces will significantly slow down schema-dependent cluster operations. This comparison and warning message generation based on the configuration value directly impact system performance at the system level, making it performance-sensitive."
