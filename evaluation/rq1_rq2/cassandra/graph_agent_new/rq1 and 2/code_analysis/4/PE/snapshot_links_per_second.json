    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'snapshot_links_per_second' is classified as performance-sensitive. From the system level perspective, this configuration directly impacts the rate at which snapshot links are processed, which can have a significant performance impact on the system. From the configuration-related code perspective, the method 'getSnapshotLinksPerSecond' includes a conditional check that determines the value based on the configuration parameter 'snapshot_links_per_second'. This configuration parameter is crucial for throttling snapshot links to prevent performance issues on consumer grade SSDs, indicating its performance sensitivity."
