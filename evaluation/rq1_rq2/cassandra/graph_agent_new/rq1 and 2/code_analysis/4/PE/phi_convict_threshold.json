    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'phi_convict_threshold' is performance-sensitive. This is because the 'phi_convict_threshold' value is directly used in the 'convict' method to make a comparison that influences the decision to mark a host down. The comparison operation in the 'convict' method is crucial for failure detection and can have a significant impact on system performance at the system level. Therefore, any changes in the 'phi_convict_threshold' configuration can lead to notable performance variations in the system."
