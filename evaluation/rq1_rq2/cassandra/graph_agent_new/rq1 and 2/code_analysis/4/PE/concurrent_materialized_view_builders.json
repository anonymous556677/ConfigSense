{
    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'concurrent_materialized_view_builders' is performance-sensitive. This classification is based on the fact that the configuration directly affects the number of concurrent view builders, which can impact system performance by managing the workload distribution for materialized view building tasks. The code context shows that this configuration is used to set and get the number of concurrent view builders, which can have a notable performance impact at the system level by influencing the execution of materialized view building tasks."
