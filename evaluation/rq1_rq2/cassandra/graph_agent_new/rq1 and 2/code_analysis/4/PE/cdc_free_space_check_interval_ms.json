    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'cdc_free_space_check_interval_ms' is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the configuration involves performance-related operations that are time-extensive within its related code. Specifically, the 'CDCSizeTracker' class calculates the total disk usage of the CDC subsystem, which includes atomic increment/decrement operations and directory size recalculations. These operations directly impact system performance at the system level by managing the allocation and deletion of CDC segments, which can lead to notable performance variations."
