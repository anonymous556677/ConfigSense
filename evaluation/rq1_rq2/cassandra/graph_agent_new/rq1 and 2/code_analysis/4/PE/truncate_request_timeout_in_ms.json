    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'truncate_request_timeout_in_ms' is classified as performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the 'getTruncateRpcTimeout' method involves time-expensive operations related to truncating data, which directly affects system performance. The method calculates a timeout value based on the difference between the configured truncate timeout and the current system time, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Additionally, the 'get' method utilizes the truncate timeout for handling timeout exceptions, indicating that the configuration directly impacts the performance of truncate operations."
