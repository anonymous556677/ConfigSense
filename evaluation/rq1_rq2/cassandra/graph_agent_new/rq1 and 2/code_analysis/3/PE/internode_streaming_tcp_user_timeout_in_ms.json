    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'internode_streaming_tcp_user_timeout_in_ms' is performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly affects the timeout for processing incoming stream messages in the 'receive' method. The code snippet checks if the processing time exceeds the configured timeout value and logs a warning if it does. This timeout value can have a significant impact on the overall system performance, especially in scenarios where the processing time is critical for maintaining system stability and responsiveness."
