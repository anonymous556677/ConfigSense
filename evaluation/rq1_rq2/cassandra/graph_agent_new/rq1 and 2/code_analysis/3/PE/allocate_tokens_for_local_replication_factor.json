    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'allocate_tokens_for_local_replication_factor' is performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration involves the allocation of tokens based on certain conditions which can directly impact the performance of the system. The code context shows that the configuration determines the tokens to be used for bootstrap operations, and depending on the specified keyspace or local replication factor, different token allocation algorithms are used. This allocation process can have a significant impact on the performance of the system, making it a performance-sensitive configuration."
