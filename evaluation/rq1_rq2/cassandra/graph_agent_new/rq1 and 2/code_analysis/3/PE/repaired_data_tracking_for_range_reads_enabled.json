    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'repaired_data_tracking_for_range_reads_enabled' is performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly affects the tracking of repaired data during range reads, which involves time-expensive operations like filtering and comparing results from multiple full replicas. The code context shows that the configuration setting is used to determine whether to request repaired data tracking info from full replicas, impacting the execution flow and memory consumption. Therefore, the configuration leads to notable performance variations at the system level."
