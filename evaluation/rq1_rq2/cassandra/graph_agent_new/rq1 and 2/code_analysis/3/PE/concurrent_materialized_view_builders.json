    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'concurrent_materialized_view_builders' is performance-sensitive. The code context reveals that this configuration directly affects the number of concurrent view builders, which can impact system performance by managing ongoing compactions and other tasks. The configuration is related to managing compaction tasks, which are time-expensive and memory-expensive operations. Additionally, the configuration involves setting the rate limiter for compaction, which further emphasizes its performance impact at the system level."
