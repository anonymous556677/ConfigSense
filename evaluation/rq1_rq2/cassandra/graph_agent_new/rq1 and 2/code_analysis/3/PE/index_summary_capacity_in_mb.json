{
    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'index_summary_capacity_in_mb' is classified as performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the 'indexSummarySizeInMB' variable is directly assigned the value of 'DatabaseDescriptor.getIndexSummaryCapacityInMB()', which indicates that this configuration parameter directly influences the memory pool size used by the IndexSummaryManager. This memory pool size allocation can have a significant impact on memory consumption at the system level, making it performance-sensitive. Additionally, the 'setMemoryPoolCapacityInMB' method call further confirms the direct impact of this configuration on memory usage within the related code context."
