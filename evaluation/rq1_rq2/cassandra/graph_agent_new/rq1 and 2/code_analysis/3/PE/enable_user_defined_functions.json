    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'enable_user_defined_functions' is performance-sensitive. This is because the 'assertUdfsEnabled' method checks if user-defined functions are enabled in Cassandra by calling 'DatabaseDescriptor.enableUserDefinedFunctions()' which in turn reads the 'enable_user_defined_functions' configuration. Enabling or disabling user-defined functions can have a notable performance impact at the system level, as it affects the execution of user-defined functions which can be time-expensive. Therefore, any changes to this configuration can lead to significant performance variations in the system."
