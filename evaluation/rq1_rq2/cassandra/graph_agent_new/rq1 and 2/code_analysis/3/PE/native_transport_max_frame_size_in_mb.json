    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'native_transport_max_frame_size_in_mb' is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the 'native_transport_max_frame_size_in_mb' configuration directly affects the maximum total length of the message envelope in the system, as seen in the 'Decoder' class. The 'MAX_TOTAL_LENGTH' constant is used to limit the total length of the message, and exceeding this limit results in discarding the message, impacting system performance. Additionally, the 'extractHeader' method in the 'Decoder' class performs operations that are time-expensive and memory-expensive, contributing to notable performance variations at the system level."
