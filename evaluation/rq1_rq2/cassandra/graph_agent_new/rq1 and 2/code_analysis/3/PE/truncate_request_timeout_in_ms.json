    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'truncate_request_timeout_in_ms' is classified as performance-sensitive. This is because the 'getTruncateRpcTimeout' method involves time-expensive operations related to truncating data, which directly impacts system performance. The method calculates a timeout based on the difference between the configured timeout and the current system time, and throws exceptions if the operation does not complete within the specified time. These time-expensive operations within the method can lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
