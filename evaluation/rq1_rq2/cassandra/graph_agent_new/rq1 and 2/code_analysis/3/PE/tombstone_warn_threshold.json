    "Reason": "The configuration option 'tombstone_warn_threshold' is not performance-sensitive. The code context provided does not contain any performance-related operations that are time-expensive or memory-expensive within the configuration-related code. Additionally, the 'tombstone_warn_threshold' configuration is a static value fetched from the DatabaseDescriptor, which does not directly and substantially affect system performance at the system level."
