    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'cdc_total_space_in_mb' is considered performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the 'cdc_total_space_in_mb' configuration directly affects the amount of space allocated for change-data-capture logs on disk. The code snippet provided shows that this configuration value is multiplied by 1024 * 1024 in the allowableCDCBytes() method, indicating that it has a direct impact on memory consumption. Any changes to this configuration can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, making it performance-sensitive."
