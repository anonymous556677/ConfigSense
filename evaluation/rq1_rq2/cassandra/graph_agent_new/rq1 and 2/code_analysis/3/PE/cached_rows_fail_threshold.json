{
    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'cached_rows_fail_threshold' is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the 'cached_rows_fail_threshold' configuration directly affects the behavior of the 'ReplicaFilteringProtection' mechanism within the 'resolveWithReplicaFilteringProtection' method. This mechanism involves time-expensive operations such as short-read protection, lazy completion of potentially out-of-date rows, and caching of valid data. The 'cached_rows_fail_threshold' configuration is used to set a threshold for failing cached replica rows, which can significantly impact the performance of the system by determining when to stop processing potentially out-of-date rows. Therefore, any changes to this configuration can lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
