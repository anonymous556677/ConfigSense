{
    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'enable_materialized_views' is not performance-sensitive. The code related to this configuration does not contain any performance-intensive operations that would lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The configuration mainly involves basic dependency validations, processing SELECT and WHERE clauses, and building the materialized view. These operations are essential for creating materialized views in Cassandra but do not have a significant impact on system performance. Therefore, based on the code context and the lack of time-expensive or memory-expensive operations, the configuration is classified as not performance-sensitive."
