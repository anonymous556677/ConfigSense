    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'internode_tcp_user_timeout_in_ms' is classified as performance-sensitive. This is because the method 'tcpUserTimeoutInMS' directly returns the value of 'internode_tcp_user_timeout_in_ms' if it is not null, which indicates that this configuration is crucial for determining the timeout value for messaging and streaming connections. Additionally, the method 'getInternodeTcpUserTimeoutInMS' is called to get the value of 'internode_tcp_user_timeout_in_ms', further emphasizing the importance of this configuration in determining system performance at the system level."
