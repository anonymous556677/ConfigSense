    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'keyspace_count_warn_threshold' is performance-sensitive. The code context provided shows that the keyspace count is compared to the keyspace count warning threshold retrieved from the configuration. If the keyspace count exceeds the threshold, a warning message is logged, indicating that having a large number of keyspaces will significantly slow down schema-dependent cluster operations. This configuration directly affects system performance by impacting the execution time of schema-dependent cluster operations, making it performance-sensitive."
