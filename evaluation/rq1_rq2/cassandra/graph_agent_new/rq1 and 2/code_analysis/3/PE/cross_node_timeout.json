    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'cross_node_timeout' is classified as performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the 'hasCrossNodeTimeout' method checks the value of the 'cross_node_timeout' configuration parameter, which is used to enable or disable operation timeout information exchange between nodes. This configuration directly affects the system performance by determining whether timeout information exchange is enabled or not, which can have a notable impact on system performance at the system level. Additionally, the 'getExpiresAtNanos' method in the provided code context also depends on the value of 'DatabaseDescriptor.hasCrossNodeTimeout()' to make decisions, indicating that this configuration is crucial for determining system behavior and performance."
