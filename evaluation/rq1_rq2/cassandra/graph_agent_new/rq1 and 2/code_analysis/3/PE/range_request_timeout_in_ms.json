{
    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'range_request_timeout_in_ms' is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the 'getRangeRpcTimeout' method directly accesses the 'DatabaseDescriptor.getRangeRpcTimeout' method, which is a performance-related operation that retrieves the range RPC timeout value. This operation can have a notable performance impact at the system level, as it involves fetching a configuration value that directly affects the timeout for range requests. Additionally, the 'getRangeRpcTimeout' method is called in multiple places within the code context, indicating its importance in determining timeout values for range operations."
