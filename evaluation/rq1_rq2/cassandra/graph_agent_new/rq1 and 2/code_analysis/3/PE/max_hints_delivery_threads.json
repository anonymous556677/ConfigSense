    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'max_hints_delivery_threads' is performance-sensitive. This is because the 'maxDeliveryThreads' configuration directly affects the number of threads used for delivering hints, which can have a substantial impact on system performance. The code snippet related to this configuration initializes the 'dispatchExecutor' with the 'maxDeliveryThreads' value, which indicates that this configuration is crucial for the dispatching of hints and can significantly impact the system's performance at the system level."
