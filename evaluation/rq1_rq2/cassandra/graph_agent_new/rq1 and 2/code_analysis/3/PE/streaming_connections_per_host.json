    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'streaming_connections_per_host' is performance-sensitive. The code context shows that the value of 'DatabaseDescriptor.getStreamingConnectionsPerHost()' is used in the 'RangeStreamer' constructor, which is a critical component for streaming data between nodes. The number of streaming connections per host directly impacts the performance of data streaming operations, affecting the overall system performance at the system level. Additionally, the 'streamer.fetchAsync()' method is called, which initiates asynchronous streaming operations based on this configuration. Therefore, any changes in the 'streaming_connections_per_host' configuration can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, making it performance-sensitive."
