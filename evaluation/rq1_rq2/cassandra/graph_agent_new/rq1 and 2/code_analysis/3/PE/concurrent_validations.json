    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'concurrent_validations' is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the 'concurrent_validations' configuration directly impacts the system's performance by adjusting the pool size for validations. The 'adjustPoolSize' method in the 'CompactionManager' class sets the maximum and core pool size based on the 'concurrent_validations' configuration. This configuration directly affects the number of concurrent validations that can be performed, which in turn affects the system's overall performance by managing the resources allocated for validations."
