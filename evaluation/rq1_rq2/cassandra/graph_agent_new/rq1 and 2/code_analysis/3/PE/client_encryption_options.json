    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'client_encryption_options' is performance-sensitive. The configuration involves creating and caching SSL Contexts, which are expensive to create and consume a lot of resources, especially direct memory. Additionally, the configuration includes methods like 'createSSLContext' and 'createNettySslContext' that handle SSL context creation and initialization, which are time-expensive operations. These operations directly impact system performance at the system level due to their resource-intensive nature."
