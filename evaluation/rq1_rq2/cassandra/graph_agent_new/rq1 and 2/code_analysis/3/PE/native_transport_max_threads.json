    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option native_transport_max_threads is performance-sensitive. The code context reveals that this configuration directly impacts the number of threads used for handling requests in the native transport system. The usage of this configuration setting affects the execution time and resource utilization at the system level, as it determines the concurrency level for processing incoming requests. Therefore, any changes to this configuration can lead to notable performance variations, making it a performance-sensitive configuration."
