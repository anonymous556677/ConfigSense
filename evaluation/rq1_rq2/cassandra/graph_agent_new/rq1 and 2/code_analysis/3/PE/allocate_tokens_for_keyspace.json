    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'allocate_tokens_for_keyspace' is performance-sensitive. The code context provided shows that this configuration directly impacts the token allocation process, which is a performance-related operation. The method 'allocateTokens' is responsible for allocating tokens based on the keyspace or replication factor specified in the configuration. This process involves waiting for the schema to settle, checking the node's address, opening the keyspace, getting the replication strategy, and allocating tokens. These operations are time-expensive and memory-expensive, leading to notable performance variations at the system level."
