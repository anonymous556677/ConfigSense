    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'stream_entire_sstables' is performance-sensitive. The code context provided shows that this configuration controls whether Cassandra can zero-copy stream entire eligible SSTables between nodes. Enabling this feature can speed up network transfer and reduce GC pressure, which directly impacts system performance at the system level. Additionally, the code snippet contains performance-related operations that contribute positively to execution time and memory consumption, making it a performance-sensitive configuration."
