{
    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'concurrent_counter_writes' is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the 'CounterMutation' class contains methods such as 'applyCounterMutation' and 'grabCounterLocks' which involve time-expensive operations like acquiring locks, reading and writing counter values, and updating counter cache. These operations directly impact system performance at the system level by introducing notable performance variations due to their time-extensive nature. Additionally, the 'CounterMutation' configuration involves performance-related operations that contribute significantly to execution time and memory consumption, making it performance-sensitive."
