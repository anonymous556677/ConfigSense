{
    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'enable_sasi_indexes' is not performance-sensitive based on the provided code context. The code snippet does not contain any performance-related operations that are time-expensive or memory-expensive. The configuration check for SASI indexes being enabled in cassandra.yaml is a validation check and does not directly involve any performance-intensive operations. Additionally, the code snippet mainly deals with schema validation and index creation logic, which are not inherently performance-sensitive operations. Therefore, the configuration is classified as not performance-sensitive."
