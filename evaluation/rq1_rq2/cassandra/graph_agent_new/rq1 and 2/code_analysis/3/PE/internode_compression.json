    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'internode_compression' is performance-sensitive. The code snippet provided shows that the decision to compress the connection between nodes is based on the 'internodeCompression' configuration setting. This decision involves checking if the nodes are in the same datacenter using the method 'isInLocalDC'. Depending on the result of this check, the connection may or may not be compressed, which can have a significant impact on performance at the system level. Therefore, the configuration directly affects system performance and involves performance-related operations that are time-expensive, making it performance-sensitive."
