    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'sstable_preemptive_open_interval_in_mb' is performance-sensitive. The code context shows that this configuration directly affects the calculation of the open interval in bytes, which can have a significant impact on system performance. The method 'calculateOpenInterval' uses this configuration to determine the interval, and any changes in this configuration can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Additionally, the unclear method 'getSSTablePreemptiveOpenIntervalInMB' is related to this configuration and further confirms its performance sensitivity by checking the system platform and returning different values based on the configuration setting."
