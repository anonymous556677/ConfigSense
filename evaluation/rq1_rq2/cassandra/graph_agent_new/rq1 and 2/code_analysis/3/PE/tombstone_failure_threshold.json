    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'tombstone_failure_threshold' is not performance-sensitive. The code context related to this configuration does not contain any performance-related operations that are time-expensive or memory-expensive. The configuration itself does not directly and substantially affect system performance at the system level. The 'tombstone_failure_threshold' configuration is used to get the tombstone failure threshold value, which is not directly related to performance-sensitive operations."
