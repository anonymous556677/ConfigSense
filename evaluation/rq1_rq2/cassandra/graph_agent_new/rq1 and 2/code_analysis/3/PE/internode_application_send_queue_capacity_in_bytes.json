    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'internode_application_send_queue_capacity_in_bytes' is performance-sensitive. The code context provided shows that this configuration directly impacts the capacity of the application send queue in bytes. This capacity can have a significant impact on the performance of the system, especially in a distributed environment where messages need to be queued for delivery to other nodes in the cluster. The method 'applicationSendQueueCapacityInBytes' retrieves this configuration value, which indicates that it is crucial for determining the system's behavior and performance at the system level."
