{
    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'counter_write_request_timeout_in_ms' is classified as performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the 'counter_write_request_timeout_in_ms' configuration directly affects the system performance at the system level. The code context provided shows that this configuration is used in multiple methods that involve time-expensive operations, such as calculating timeouts based on different criteria. These time-expensive operations can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, making this configuration performance-sensitive."
