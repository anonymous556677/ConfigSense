    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'memtable_cleanup_threshold' is performance-sensitive. The code context provided shows that the 'memtable_cleanup_threshold' is used in the creation of a MemtablePool, which directly impacts memory allocation and cleanup strategies. The 'cleaningThreshold' parameter in the MemtablePool creation is derived from 'memtable_cleanup_threshold', indicating that this configuration setting plays a crucial role in determining how memory is managed for memtables. Any changes in 'memtable_cleanup_threshold' can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, making it a performance-sensitive configuration."
