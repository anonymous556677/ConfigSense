    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'snapshot_links_per_second' is classified as performance-sensitive. From the system level perspective, this configuration directly affects the rate at which snapshots are created or cleared, which can have a significant impact on system performance, especially on SSDs. From the configuration-related code perspective, the 'getSnapshotLinksPerSecond' method retrieves the value from the configuration and uses it to create a RateLimiter, indicating that the value has a direct impact on controlling the rate of snapshot operations, which are time-expensive."
