    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'inter_dc_tcp_nodelay' is classified as performance-sensitive. This is because the 'tcpNoDelay' method directly impacts the system performance by determining whether to use the 'INTRADC_TCP_NODELAY' setting or the 'inter_dc_tcp_nodelay' setting based on whether the communication is within the same datacenter or not. This decision involves performance-related operations that can lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
