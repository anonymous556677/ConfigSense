    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'index_summary_resize_interval_in_minutes' is performance-sensitive. The configuration setting directly affects the frequency at which index summaries are resampled, which can have a significant impact on system performance. The code context shows that this configuration is used to set the interval for resizing index summaries, which involves memory-expensive operations. Changes in this configuration can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, making it performance-sensitive."
