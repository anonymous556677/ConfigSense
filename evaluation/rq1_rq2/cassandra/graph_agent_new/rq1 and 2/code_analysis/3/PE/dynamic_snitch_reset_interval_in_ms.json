    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'dynamic_snitch_reset_interval_in_ms' is performance-sensitive. The code context provided shows that this configuration directly affects the system performance by setting the update and reset intervals for the DynamicEndpointSnitch. These intervals are used to schedule tasks that impact the system's performance by updating scores and resetting bad hosts. Changing these intervals can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, making it a performance-sensitive configuration."
