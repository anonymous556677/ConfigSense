    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'repair_session_space_in_mb' is performance-sensitive. This is because the 'repair_session_space_in_mb' configuration directly affects the amount of available memory for creating MerkleTrees in the 'createMerkleTrees' method. The calculation of 'availableBytes' based on 'DatabaseDescriptor.getRepairSessionSpaceInMegabytes()' plays a crucial role in determining the memory allocation for the MerkleTrees. This memory allocation has a direct impact on the performance of the system as it influences the depth and size of the MerkleTrees, which in turn affects the overall memory consumption and execution time of the system-level operations. Therefore, any changes in the 'repair_session_space_in_mb' configuration can lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
