    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'file_cache_enabled' is performance-sensitive. The 'file_cache_enabled' configuration directly affects the system performance at the system level by enabling or disabling the ChunkCache instance based on the value of 'enabled'. The 'enabled' variable is calculated based on the 'DatabaseDescriptor.getFileCacheEnabled()' method and 'cacheSize' value. If 'enabled' is true, it creates a new ChunkCache instance, which involves time-expensive and memory-expensive operations. This directly impacts the system performance by caching chunks and managing buffer pools, leading to notable performance variations."
