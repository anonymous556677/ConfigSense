    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'ideal_consistency_level' is performance-sensitive. This is because the 'ideal_consistency_level' configuration directly affects the performance of the system at the system level. The 'ideal_consistency_level' configuration is used in the code context to determine the consistency level for replication, which is a critical factor in the performance of distributed systems. The code snippet shows that the 'ideal_consistency_level' is used to construct response handlers based on the specified consistency level, which can have a significant impact on the performance of write operations. Therefore, any changes or variations in the 'ideal_consistency_level' configuration can lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
