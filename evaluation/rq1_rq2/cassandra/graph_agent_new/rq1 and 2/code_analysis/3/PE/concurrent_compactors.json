    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'concurrent_compactors' is performance-sensitive. The code context includes methods related to compaction management, such as submitting background tasks for compaction, performing scrub, garbage collection, and anti-compaction. These operations directly impact system performance by managing the concurrency of compaction tasks. The 'concurrent_compactors' configuration parameter determines the number of simultaneous compactions allowed, which can significantly affect system performance by optimizing read performance and preventing accumulation of small sstables during compaction. Therefore, based on the code context and its direct impact on system performance, the configuration is classified as performance-sensitive."
