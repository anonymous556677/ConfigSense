    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'cdc_free_space_check_interval_ms' is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the 'CDCSizeTracker' class, which is related to this configuration, involves performance-related operations that are time-extensive and memory-expensive. The 'CDCSizeTracker' class calculates the total disk usage of the CDC subsystem, which directly impacts system performance at the system level. Additionally, the 'CDCSizeTracker' class uses a ThreadPoolExecutor and RateLimiter for asynchronous size recalculation, which can have a notable performance impact on the system."
