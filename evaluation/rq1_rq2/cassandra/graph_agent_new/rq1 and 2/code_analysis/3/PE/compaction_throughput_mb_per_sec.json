    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'compaction_throughput_mb_per_sec' is classified as performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the 'compaction_throughput_mb_per_sec' setting directly affects the rate at which compaction operations are performed in the system. The code context provided shows that this configuration setting is used to set the rate limiter for compaction operations, indicating that it plays a crucial role in controlling the performance of compaction processes. Since compaction operations can have a significant impact on system performance, any changes to the compaction throughput rate can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Therefore, this configuration is considered performance-sensitive."
