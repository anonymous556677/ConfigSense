{
    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'table_count_warn_threshold' is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the 'tableCount' variable in the code context is compared to the 'table_count_warn_threshold' configuration value, which directly impacts the behavior of the system. If the number of tables exceeds the threshold, a warning message is logged, indicating a potential performance issue. This configuration involves a performance-related operation (comparing table count) that can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, making it performance-sensitive."
