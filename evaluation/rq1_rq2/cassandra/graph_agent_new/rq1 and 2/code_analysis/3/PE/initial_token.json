    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'initial_token' configuration option is classified as performance-sensitive. This is because the 'initial_token' configuration directly impacts the token generation process, which is a critical operation for system performance. The code context shows that depending on the presence of 'initial_tokens' and 'allocationKeyspace', different token generation algorithms are used, which can significantly affect the system's performance at the system level. The presence of time-expensive and memory-expensive operations related to token generation within the code indicates that this configuration can lead to notable performance variations."
