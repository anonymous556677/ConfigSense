    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'internode_authenticator' configuration option is performance-sensitive. This is because the 'internode_authenticator' configuration directly affects the system performance at the system level by setting the internode authenticator for network communication. The code snippet related to this configuration involves operations that are time-expensive and memory-expensive, such as constructing the internode authenticator and setting it using 'DatabaseDescriptor.setInternodeAuthenticator'. These operations can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, making the 'internode_authenticator' configuration performance-sensitive."
