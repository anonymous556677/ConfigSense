    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'native_transport_idle_timeout_in_ms' is classified as performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the idle timeout value set by this configuration directly impacts the behavior of client connections in the native transport layer. The code snippet provided shows that this configuration is used to set the idle timeout for client connections, and if the idle timeout is greater than 0, a handler is added to the channel pipeline to close idle connections after the specified timeout. This operation is time-expensive and can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, as it directly affects the handling of client connections in the system."
