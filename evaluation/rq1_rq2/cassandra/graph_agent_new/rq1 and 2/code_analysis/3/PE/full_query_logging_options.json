    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'full_query_logging_options' is classified as performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the 'getFullQueryLoggerOptions()' method involves retrieving various options for full query logging, which can have a notable impact on system performance depending on the values of these options. The method includes operations that access and set values for options such as 'roll_cycle', 'block', 'max_queue_weight', 'max_log_size', and 'archive_command', which can be time-expensive and memory-expensive. These operations directly affect the behavior of the full query logging feature, leading to notable performance variations at the system level."
