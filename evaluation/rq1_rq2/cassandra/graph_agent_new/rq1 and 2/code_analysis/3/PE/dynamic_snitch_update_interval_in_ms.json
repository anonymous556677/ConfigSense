    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'dynamic_snitch_update_interval_in_ms' is performance-sensitive. This is because the 'dynamicUpdateInterval' and 'dynamicResetInterval' values directly impact the scheduling of tasks that involve time-expensive operations in the code. These values are used to set the intervals for updating and resetting the dynamic endpoint snitch, which involves scheduling tasks that execute at fixed delays. The dynamicUpdateInterval and dynamicResetInterval configurations are crucial for determining how frequently these tasks run, and any changes to these values can have a notable impact on system performance at the system level by affecting the execution time of these tasks."
