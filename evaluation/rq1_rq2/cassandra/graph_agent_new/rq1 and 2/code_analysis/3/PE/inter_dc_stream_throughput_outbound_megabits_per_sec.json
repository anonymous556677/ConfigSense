    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'inter_dc_stream_throughput_outbound_megabits_per_sec' is classified as performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly affects the inter-DC stream throughput in megabits per second, which in turn impacts the data transfer rate between data centers. The code snippets provided show that changing this configuration triggers the update of the inter-DC throughput and calculates the rate in bytes based on the configured throughput. These operations are time-expensive and memory-expensive, leading to notable performance variations at the system level."
