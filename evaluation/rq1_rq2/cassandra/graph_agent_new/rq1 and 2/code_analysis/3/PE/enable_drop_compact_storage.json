{
    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'enable_drop_compact_storage' is classified as performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the configuration directly affects the system performance at the system level by controlling the usage of 'ALTER ... DROP COMPACT STORAGE' statements. The code related to this configuration involves time-expensive and memory-expensive operations such as validating table parameters, setting flags, and performing checks before altering table storage. These operations can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, making the configuration performance-sensitive."
