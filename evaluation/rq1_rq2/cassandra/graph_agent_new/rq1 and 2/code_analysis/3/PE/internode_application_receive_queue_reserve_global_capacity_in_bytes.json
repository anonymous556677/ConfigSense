    "Reason": "The configuration option 'internode_application_receive_queue_reserve_global_capacity_in_bytes' is not performance-sensitive based on the provided code context. The code snippet provided does not contain any performance-related operations that are time-expensive or memory-expensive. Additionally, the configuration does not directly and substantially affect system performance at the system level. Therefore, it does not lead to notable performance variations and should be classified as not performance-sensitive."
