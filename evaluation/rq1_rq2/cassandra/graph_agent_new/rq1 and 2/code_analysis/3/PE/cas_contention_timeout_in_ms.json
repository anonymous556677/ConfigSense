    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'cas_contention_timeout_in_ms' is performance-sensitive. The code context provided shows that this configuration directly affects the performance of the system at the system level. The 'doPaxos' method uses the 'cas_contention_timeout_in_ms' configuration to set the timeout for Paxos rounds. The timeout value directly impacts the retry behavior and performance of the Paxos algorithm, which is critical for system consistency and availability. Additionally, the 'beginAndRepairPaxos' method also uses the timeout value to control the preparation and repair process in Paxos rounds, further emphasizing the performance impact of this configuration."
