    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'num_tokens' configuration is performance-sensitive. The configuration directly impacts the system performance by checking the number of tokens in various parts of the code. Specifically, the validation of transient replication and the calculation of disk boundaries are time-expensive operations that contribute significantly to system performance. The 'num_tokens' configuration involves operations that are memory-expensive and time-expensive, leading to notable performance variations at the system level."
