    "classification_result": "Performance-insensitive with 100% confidence",
    "Reason": "The configuration option of whether or not to take a snapshot before each compaction is performance-insensitive because it does not directly impact system performance or involve any time-dependent aspects of system operation. It is related to data management and not critical for overall system performance."
