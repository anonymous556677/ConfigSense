    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'counter_cache_size_in_mb' is classified as performance-sensitive. This is because the 'counter_cache_size_in_mb' configuration directly affects the capacity of the counter cache in memory, which can have a significant impact on system performance. The code context shows that the size of the counter cache is used to initialize the cache with a specific capacity in bytes. This capacity directly influences memory consumption and can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Therefore, the configuration is considered performance-sensitive."
