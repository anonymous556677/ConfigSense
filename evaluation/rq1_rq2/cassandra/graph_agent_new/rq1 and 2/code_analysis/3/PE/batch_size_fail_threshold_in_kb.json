{
    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'batch_size_fail_threshold_in_kb' is classified as performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the configuration directly affects the batch size failure threshold, which can have a significant impact on system performance. The code context shows that the configuration setting is retrieved and returned, indicating that it is a critical parameter for determining system behavior. Changes in this configuration can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, making it performance-sensitive."
