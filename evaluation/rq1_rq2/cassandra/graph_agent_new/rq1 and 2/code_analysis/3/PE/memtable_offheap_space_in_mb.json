    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'memtable_offheap_space_in_mb' is performance-sensitive. This is because the value of 'memtable_offheap_space_in_mb' directly determines the off-heap memory limit for memtables in Cassandra, which can have a significant impact on system performance. The code context shows that this configuration is used to calculate the offHeapLimit, which is crucial for memory allocation in the MemtablePool. Any changes to this configuration can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, making it performance-sensitive."
