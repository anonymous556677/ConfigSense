    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'streaming_keep_alive_period_in_secs' is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the configuration directly affects the keep-alive period for streaming, which is crucial for maintaining connections and preventing timeouts. The code context shows that the value of 'streaming_keep_alive_period_in_secs' is used in scheduling keep-alive tasks with specific time intervals. Any changes to this configuration can have a significant impact on the performance of streaming operations, leading to notable performance variations at the system level."
