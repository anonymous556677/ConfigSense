{
    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'internode_tcp_connect_timeout_in_ms' is classified as performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the 'tcpConnectTimeoutInMS' method directly retrieves the internode TCP connect timeout value, which can have a notable impact on system performance. The method involves a performance-related operation of fetching the timeout value, which is time-expensive and can lead to significant performance variations at the system level."
