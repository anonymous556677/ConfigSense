    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'audit_logging_options' configuration is performance-sensitive. The configuration directly impacts the system performance by enabling audit logging and creating an AuditLogger based on the provided options. The code snippets related to the configuration involve time-expensive operations such as creating audit logs, setting log paths, and handling log parameters. These operations can have a notable performance impact at the system level, especially when audit logging is enabled, leading to significant performance variations."
