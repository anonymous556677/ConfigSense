    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'cached_rows_warn_threshold' configuration is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the configuration directly affects the performance of the system at the system level. The code snippet provided shows that the 'cached_rows_warn_threshold' configuration is used in the ReplicaFilteringProtection class to set the threshold for warning about cached replica rows. This threshold value can impact the behavior of the system in resolving partitions with replica filtering protection, which involves time-extensive operations like merging potentially out-of-date rows and completing rows by querying silent replicas. Therefore, changes in the 'cached_rows_warn_threshold' configuration can lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
