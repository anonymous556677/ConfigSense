    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'internode_application_receive_queue_reserve_endpoint_capacity_in_bytes' is performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly affects the capacity of the application send queue reserve for each endpoint in the internode communication system. The code context reveals that this configuration is crucial for managing the memory utilization limits on individual endpoints and preventing overwhelming a host with enqueued, undelivered messages. The configuration involves performance-related operations that are memory-expensive and lead to notable performance variations at the system level by imposing strict memory utilization limits. Therefore, it directly and substantially affects system performance, making it performance-sensitive."
