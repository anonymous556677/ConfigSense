    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'file_cache_size_in_mb' is performance-sensitive. The 'file_cache_size_in_mb' configuration directly affects the calculation of the 'cacheSize' in the 'ChunkCache' class, which is a critical parameter for determining the size of the cache. The 'cacheSize' is used to set the maximum weight for the cache in the 'Caffeine' builder, impacting the memory consumption and performance of the cache operations. Any changes in the 'file_cache_size_in_mb' configuration value will lead to notable performance variations at the system level due to the direct impact on memory allocation and cache size."
