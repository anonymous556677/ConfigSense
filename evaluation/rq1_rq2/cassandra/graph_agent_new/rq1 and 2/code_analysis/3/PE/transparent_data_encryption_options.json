    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'transparent_data_encryption_options' is not performance-sensitive. The code related to this configuration does not contain any performance-related operations that are time-extensive or memory-extensive. The configuration initialization and handling methods do not directly and substantially affect system performance at the system level. The operations within the code related to this configuration are more focused on handling file operations, encryption, and handling commit log segments, which do not lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
