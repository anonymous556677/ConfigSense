{
    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'write_request_timeout_in_ms' is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the configuration directly affects the timeout duration for write requests to complete, which is a critical factor in system performance. The code context includes methods like 'applyInternal' and 'getTimeout' that handle write operations and timeout calculations, indicating the importance of the configuration in managing system performance at the write operation level."
