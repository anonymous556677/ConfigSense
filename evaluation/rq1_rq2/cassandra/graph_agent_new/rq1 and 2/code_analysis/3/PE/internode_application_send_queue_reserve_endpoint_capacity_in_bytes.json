{
    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'internode_application_send_queue_reserve_endpoint_capacity_in_bytes' is classified as performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the configuration directly impacts the application reserve send queue endpoint capacity in bytes, which is crucial for outbound connections. The code snippet provided shows that this configuration is used to set the application reserve send queue endpoint capacity, which can have a significant impact on the performance of outbound connections at the system level. Additionally, the method 'getInternodeApplicationSendQueueReserveEndpointCapacityInBytes' directly retrieves this configuration value, further emphasizing its importance in performance optimization."
