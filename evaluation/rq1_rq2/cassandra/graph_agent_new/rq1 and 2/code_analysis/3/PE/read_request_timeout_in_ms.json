{
    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'read_request_timeout_in_ms' is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the configuration involves performance-related operations such as calculating minimum RPC timeout, initializing memtables, loading SSTables, creating compaction strategies, registering MBeans, initializing metrics, setting up server internals, enabling auto-compaction, and scheduling background tasks. These operations directly impact system performance by affecting read and write latencies, memory usage, compaction efficiency, and overall system stability. Additionally, the configuration interacts with critical system components like Memtable, SSTableReader, CompactionStrategyManager, SecondaryIndexManager, TableMetrics, CommitLog, and StorageService, further emphasizing its performance sensitivity."
