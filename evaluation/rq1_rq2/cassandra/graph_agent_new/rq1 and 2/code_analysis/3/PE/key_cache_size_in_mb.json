    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'key_cache_size_in_mb' is performance-sensitive. The code snippet provided initializes a key cache with a specific capacity in MBs, which directly impacts the memory consumption of the system. The 'keyCacheInMemoryCapacity' calculation based on the 'key_cache_size_in_mb' configuration shows that the size of the key cache in memory is directly influenced by this configuration. Additionally, the 'create' method from the Caffeine library, used in the code snippet, involves memory-expensive operations related to cache initialization, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
