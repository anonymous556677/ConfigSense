    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'server_encryption_options' is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the 'server_encryption_options' configuration directly impacts the SSL/TLS encryption settings used in the system, which can have a notable performance impact at the system level. The code related to this configuration involves creating SSL contexts, validating SSL certificates, and setting up SSL/TLS connections, which are time-expensive and memory-expensive operations. These operations, such as creating SSL contexts and validating certificates, can lead to significant performance variations in the system due to their resource-intensive nature."
