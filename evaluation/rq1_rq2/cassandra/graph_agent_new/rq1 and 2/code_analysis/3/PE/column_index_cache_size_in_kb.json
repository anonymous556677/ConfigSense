    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'column_index_cache_size_in_kb' is performance-sensitive. This is because the 'getColumnIndexCacheSize' method directly retrieves the value of 'column_index_cache_size_in_kb' from the configuration object, which is used to determine the size of the column index cache for sstable indexed key cache entries. This configuration directly impacts the performance of the system by affecting the size of the cache, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
