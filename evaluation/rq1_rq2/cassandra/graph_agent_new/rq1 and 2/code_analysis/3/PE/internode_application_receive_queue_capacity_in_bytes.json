    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'internode_application_receive_queue_capacity_in_bytes' is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the 'applicationReceiveQueueCapacityInBytes' configuration directly affects the system's performance at the system level. The code snippet shows that this configuration is checked against a minimum value of 1 << 10, which indicates that it has a significant impact on memory consumption. Additionally, the configuration is part of the 'InboundConnectionSettings' class, which is crucial for handling inbound messages and routing them to the appropriate handlers. Therefore, any variations in the 'applicationReceiveQueueCapacityInBytes' configuration can lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
