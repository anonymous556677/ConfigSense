    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'memtable_heap_space_in_mb' is performance-sensitive. This is because the 'memtable_heap_space_in_mb' configuration directly affects the heap space allocated for memtables, which can have a significant impact on memory consumption and overall system performance. The code snippet provided shows that the configuration value is used to calculate heapLimit, which is crucial for memory allocation. Additionally, the different cases in the switch statement show that the configuration can lead to different memory allocation strategies, further emphasizing its performance sensitivity."
