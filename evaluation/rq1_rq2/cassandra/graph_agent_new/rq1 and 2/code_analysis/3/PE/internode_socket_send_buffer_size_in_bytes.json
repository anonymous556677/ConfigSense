{
    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'internode_socket_send_buffer_size_in_bytes' is classified as performance-sensitive. The code context provided shows that this configuration directly impacts the socket send buffer size for internode communication. This can have a significant impact on system performance, especially in scenarios where internode communication is frequent and critical. The method 'socketSendBufferSizeInBytes' retrieves this configuration value, indicating its importance in determining performance-related operations. Therefore, the configuration involves performance-related operations that are time-expensive and memory-expensive, leading to notable performance variations at the system level."
