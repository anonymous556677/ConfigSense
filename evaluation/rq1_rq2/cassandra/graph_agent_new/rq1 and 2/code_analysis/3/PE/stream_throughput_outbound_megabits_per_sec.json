    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'stream_throughput_outbound_megabits_per_sec' is classified as performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the 'setStreamThroughputMbPerSec' method directly modifies the stream throughput outbound megabits per second value, which in turn affects the rate of data transfer. The 'calculateRateInBytes' method calculates the rate in bytes based on the outbound megabits per second value, showing a direct impact on system performance. Therefore, any changes to this configuration can lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
