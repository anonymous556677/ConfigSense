    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'incremental_backups' is performance-sensitive. The code context provided shows that the configuration is directly related to enabling or disabling incremental backups, which involves creating links for SSTableReader objects. Enabling or disabling incremental backups can have a significant impact on system performance, as it affects the backup process for SSTableReader objects. Therefore, this configuration can lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
