{
    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'row_cache_size_in_mb' is classified as performance-sensitive. This is because the 'row_cache_size_in_mb' value is directly used to determine the capacity of the row cache in memory, affecting the memory consumption of the system. The code snippets related to the configuration involve operations that contribute to memory consumption, such as setting the capacity of the cache based on the 'row_cache_size_in_mb' value. This can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, making it performance-sensitive."
