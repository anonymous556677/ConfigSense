    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'native_transport_flush_in_batches_legacy' is performance-sensitive. The method useNativeTransportLegacyFlusher() directly retrieves this configuration parameter, which determines whether to use native transport TCP message coalescing. This configuration can impact system throughput, especially during an upgrade to version 4.0, and developers can optimize performance based on kernel version and client connections. Therefore, this configuration involves performance-related operations that are time-extensive and memory-extensive, leading to notable performance variations at the system level."
