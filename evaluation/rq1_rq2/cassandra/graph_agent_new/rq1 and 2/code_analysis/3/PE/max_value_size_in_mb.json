    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'max_value_size_in_mb' is performance-sensitive. The code snippets related to this configuration involve operations that read arrays from input streams and deserialize data, which are time-expensive and memory-expensive operations. These operations directly impact the system performance at the system level by handling large byte arrays based on the 'max_value_size_in_mb' configuration. Therefore, the configuration is considered performance-sensitive."
