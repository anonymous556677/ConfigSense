    "config_description": "Policy for commit disk failures:  die shut down the node and kill the JVM, so the node can be replaced.  stop shut down the node, leaving the node effectively dead, but can still be inspected via JMX.  stop_commit shutdown the commit log, letting writes collect but continuing to service reads, as in pre-2.0.5 Cassandra  ignore ignore fatal errors and let the batches fail",
    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The configuration 'commit_failure_policy' determines the behavior of the system when a commit disk failure occurs. The code snippet provided shows that when a commit error is encountered, the system inspects the commit log throwable and then checks the commit failure policy to decide the action to take. Depending on the policy (die, stop, stop_commit, ignore), different actions are taken such as stopping transports, logging errors, or terminating threads.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The triggering frequency of the 'commit_failure_policy' configuration depends on the occurrence of commit disk failures in the system. The configuration is triggered whenever a commit error is encountered during the system operation.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the 'commit_failure_policy' configuration option on the system is significant as it determines how the system handles commit disk failures. Depending on the chosen policy, the system may shut down, stop certain operations, or ignore errors. This can impact the availability and reliability of the system in case of commit failures."
