    "config_description": "Controls when idle client connections are closed. Idle connections are ones that had neither reads nor writes for a time period.  Clients may implement heartbeats by sending OPTIONS native protocol message after a timeout, which will reset idle timeout timer on the server side. To close idle client connections, corresponding values for heartbeat intervals have to be set on the client side.  Idle connection timeouts are disabled by default.",
    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The configuration 'native_transport_idle_timeout_in_ms' controls when idle client connections are closed. If the idle timeout value is set to a positive value, an IdleStateHandler is added to the channel's pipeline. This handler will trigger a channelIdle event when the channel has been idle for the specified timeout period, resulting in the client connection being closed.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The triggering frequency of the 'native_transport_idle_timeout_in_ms' configuration depends on the idle behavior of client connections. If clients do not send any reads or writes within the specified idle timeout period, the IdleStateHandler will trigger the channelIdle event and close the connection. The frequency of triggering will depend on the client behavior and the configured idle timeout value.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the 'native_transport_idle_timeout_in_ms' configuration option on the system is related to the management of idle client connections. Setting a lower idle timeout value may result in more frequent closure of idle connections, which can help in freeing up resources and maintaining connection limits. However, setting a very low timeout value may also lead to premature closure of connections, impacting client-server communication. It is important to balance the idle timeout value based on the system's requirements and client behavior."
