    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The configuration 'phi_convict_threshold' is used in the code to determine the phi value that must be reached for a host to be marked down. It is used in the 'convict' method to check if the phi value is below a certain threshold before taking action.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The triggering frequency of the 'phi_convict_threshold' configuration depends on the failure detection mechanism and the phi values calculated for each host. It is triggered when a host's phi value exceeds 2 times the configured threshold.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the 'phi_convict_threshold' configuration option is significant as it determines when a host is marked as down in the system. Setting this threshold too low may result in false positives and unnecessary node replacements, while setting it too high may delay the detection of failed nodes."
