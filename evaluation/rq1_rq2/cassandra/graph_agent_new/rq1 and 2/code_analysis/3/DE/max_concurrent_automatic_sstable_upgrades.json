    "config_description": "Automatically upgrade sstables after upgrade - if there is no ordinary compaction to do, the oldest non-upgraded sstable will get upgraded to the latest version automatic_sstable_upgrade: false Limit the number of concurrent sstable upgrades",
    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The configuration 'max_concurrent_automatic_sstable_upgrades' controls the maximum number of concurrent sstable upgrades that can be automatically triggered in the system. The code snippet provided checks if the number of currently running background upgrade tasks is less than or equal to the value specified in 'max_concurrent_automatic_sstable_upgrades' from the DatabaseDescriptor. If so, it finds the oldest non-upgraded sstable and upgrades it to the latest version.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The triggering frequency of the configuration depends on the availability of upgrade tasks and the current number of running background upgrade tasks. If there are upgrade tasks available and the number of currently running tasks is less than the value specified in 'max_concurrent_automatic_sstable_upgrades', the configuration will be triggered.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the 'max_concurrent_automatic_sstable_upgrades' configuration option on the system is that it limits the number of concurrent sstable upgrades that can be automatically triggered. This helps in controlling the system resources and ensures that the upgrades are managed efficiently without overwhelming the system with too many concurrent upgrade tasks."
