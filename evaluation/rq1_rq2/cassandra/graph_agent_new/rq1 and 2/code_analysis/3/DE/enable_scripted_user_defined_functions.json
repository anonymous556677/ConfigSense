    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The configuration 'enable_scripted_user_defined_functions' is checked in the assertUdfsEnabled method to ensure that scripted user-defined functions are enabled in cassandra.yaml. If the configuration is not enabled, an InvalidRequestException is thrown.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The triggering frequency of the 'enable_scripted_user_defined_functions' configuration depends on how often the assertUdfsEnabled method is called in the system. This would typically happen when user-defined functions are being used in queries that require scripted UDFs.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "Enabling the 'enable_scripted_user_defined_functions' configuration allows the system to use scripted user-defined functions in addition to Java UDFs. This can provide more flexibility in writing custom functions for queries, but it also introduces security risks that need to be considered."
