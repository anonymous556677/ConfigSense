For 'batch' and 'group' options, the triggering frequency may vary based on the implementation of the respective CommitLog service.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the 'commitlog_sync' configuration option on the system is significant as it determines how frequently the CommitLog is synced. The choice of 'commitlog_sync' option can affect the performance and durability of write operations in the system. For example, choosing 'periodic' may provide better latency for writes but may have a higher risk of data loss in case of failures, while 'batch' or 'group' options may provide better durability at the cost of increased latency."
