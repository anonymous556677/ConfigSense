    "config_description": "Limit memory usage for Merkle tree calculations during repairs of a certain table and common token range. Repair commands targetting multiple tables or virtual nodes can exceed this limit depending on concurrent_merkle_tree_requests.  The default is 1/16th of the available heap. The main tradeoff is that smaller trees have less resolution, which can lead to over-streaming data. If you see heap pressure during repairs, consider lowering this, but you cannot go below one mebibyte. If you see lots of over-streaming, consider raising this or using subrange repair.  For more details see https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CASSANDRA-14096. ",
    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The 'repair_session_space_in_mb' configuration is used to limit memory usage for Merkle tree calculations during repairs of a certain table and common token range. The configuration value is retrieved using DatabaseDescriptor.getRepairSessionSpaceInMegabytes() method and is used to calculate the available space for holding RF trees in memory during validation compaction.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The triggering frequency of the 'repair_session_space_in_mb' configuration depends on the repair operations that target specific tables and token ranges. It is triggered whenever a repair session is initiated and the Merkle tree calculations are performed during the repair process.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the 'repair_session_space_in_mb' configuration option is significant as it directly affects the memory usage during repair operations. Setting a higher value can increase memory usage but provide more resolution in Merkle trees, while setting a lower value can reduce memory usage but may lead to over-streaming data. It is recommended to adjust this configuration based on the heap pressure observed during repairs and the need for resolution in Merkle trees."
