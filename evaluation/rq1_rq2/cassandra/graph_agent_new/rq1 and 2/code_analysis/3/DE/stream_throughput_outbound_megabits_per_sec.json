    "config_description": "Throttles all streaming file transfer between the datacenters, this setting allows users to throttle inter dc stream throughput in addition to throttling all network stream traffic as configured with",
    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The configuration 'stream_throughput_outbound_megabits_per_sec' controls the outbound stream throughput in megabits per second for streaming file transfers between datacenters. The setStreamThroughputMbPerSec method sets the value of the throughput, the getStreamThroughputMbPerSec method retrieves the current value, and the calculateRateInBytes method calculates the rate in bytes based on the throughput setting.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The configuration is triggered whenever the setStreamThroughputMbPerSec method is called to set a new value for the stream throughput. The frequency of triggering depends on how often this method is invoked in the system.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the configuration option is significant as it directly affects the rate at which streaming file transfers occur between datacenters. A higher throughput setting will result in faster data transfer, while a lower setting will throttle the transfer speed. It is important to carefully adjust this configuration based on the network capacity and performance requirements to optimize data transfer efficiency."
