    "config_description": "Throttles all streaming file transfer between the datacenters, this setting allows users to throttle inter dc stream throughput in addition to throttling all network stream traffic as configured with stream_throughput_outbound_megabits_per_sec When unset, the default is 200 Mbps or 25 MB/s",
    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The configuration 'inter_dc_stream_throughput_outbound_megabits_per_sec' is used to throttle all streaming file transfer between datacenters. It allows users to set a limit on the inter dc stream throughput, in addition to the limit set for all network stream traffic with 'stream_throughput_outbound_megabits_per_sec'. The configuration value is used to calculate the rate in bytes for inter dc streaming.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The configuration is triggered whenever the 'setInterDCStreamThroughputMbPerSec' method is called to set a new value for the inter dc stream throughput. It is also triggered when the rate in bytes for inter dc streaming is calculated using the 'calculateInterDCRateInBytes' method.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the configuration option is significant as it directly affects the throughput of streaming file transfers between datacenters. Setting a lower value for the configuration will limit the inter dc stream throughput, potentially affecting the overall performance of the system in terms of data transfer speed between datacenters."
