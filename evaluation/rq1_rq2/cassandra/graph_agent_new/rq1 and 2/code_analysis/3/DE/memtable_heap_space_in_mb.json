When the total memory used by memtables exceeds the configured limit, Cassandra will stop accepting writes until a flush completes. The frequency of triggering a flush is determined by the memtable_cleanup_threshold value.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the 'memtable_heap_space_in_mb' configuration option on the system is significant. If the configured memory limit is too low, it can lead to frequent flushes and potentially impact the write performance of the system. On the other hand, if the memory limit is set too high, it can lead to increased memory usage and potential out-of-memory errors."
