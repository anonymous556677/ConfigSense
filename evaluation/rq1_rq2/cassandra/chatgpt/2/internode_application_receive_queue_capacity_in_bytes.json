    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'internode_application_receive_queue_capacity_in_bytes' in the 'cassandra' software project is performance-sensitive because changing its value can significantly impact the system's performance. This configuration determines the capacity of the receive queue for inter-node communication, and a lower capacity may lead to increased message dropping and delays in communication, while a higher capacity may result in increased memory consumption and potential bottlenecks in message processing, both of which can affect overall system performance."
