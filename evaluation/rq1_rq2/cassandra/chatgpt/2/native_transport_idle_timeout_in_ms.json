    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The native_transport_idle_timeout_in_ms configuration in the Cassandra software project is performance-sensitive because changing its value can significantly impact the system's performance. This configuration determines the idle timeout for native transport connections, and a lower value can lead to quicker connection termination, potentially affecting overall system performance and resource utilization."
