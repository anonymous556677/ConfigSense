    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'incremental_backups' configuration option in the Cassandra software project is performance-sensitive because enabling incremental backups can significantly impact system performance. Incremental backups involve only backing up data that has changed since the last backup, which can lead to increased CPU and I/O usage during the backup process. This can result in variations in execution time and resource consumption, making it a performance-sensitive configuration."
