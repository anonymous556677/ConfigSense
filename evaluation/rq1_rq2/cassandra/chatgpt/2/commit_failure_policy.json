    "Reason": "The 'commit_failure_policy' configuration in the Cassandra software project is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the system's behavior in handling commit failures. A change in this configuration can lead to significant variations in system performance, such as affecting the durability of data and potentially increasing the time taken for commit operations, which can impact overall system throughput and response times."
