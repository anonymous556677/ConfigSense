    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'max_concurrent_automatic_sstable_upgrades' in the Cassandra software project is performance-sensitive because changing its value can significantly impact system performance. Increasing the maximum number of concurrent automatic sstable upgrades can lead to higher CPU and memory usage, potentially causing performance degradation due to increased resource contention and slower response times."
