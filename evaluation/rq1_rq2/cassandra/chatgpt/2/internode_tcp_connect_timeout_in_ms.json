    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The internode_tcp_connect_timeout_in_ms configuration in the Cassandra software project is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the communication latency between nodes in a distributed system. A longer timeout value can lead to increased delays in establishing connections between nodes, potentially affecting overall system performance and response times. Conversely, a shorter timeout value can result in quicker connection establishment but may also increase the likelihood of connection failures, impacting system reliability. Therefore, any changes to this configuration can have a significant impact on system performance and should be carefully considered."
