    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The dynamic_snitch_reset_interval_in_ms configuration in the Cassandra software project is performance-sensitive because changing its value can significantly impact the system's performance. This configuration determines how often the dynamic snitch resets its internal state, affecting how nodes are perceived in the cluster. A lower interval may lead to more frequent recalculations and potentially higher overhead, while a higher interval may result in slower adaptation to changing node behaviors. Therefore, any change in this configuration can cause notable variations in query response times and overall system performance."
