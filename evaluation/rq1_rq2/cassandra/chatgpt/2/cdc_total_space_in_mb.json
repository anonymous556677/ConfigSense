    "Reason": "The configuration option cdc_total_space_in_mb in the cassandra software project is performance-sensitive because changing its value can directly impact the amount of space allocated for change data capture (CDC) logs. If the allocated space is insufficient, it can lead to increased disk I/O operations, potentially causing delays in data processing and affecting overall system performance."
