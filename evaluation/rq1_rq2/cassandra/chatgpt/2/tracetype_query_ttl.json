    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'tracetype_query_ttl' in the Cassandra software project is performance-sensitive because it determines the time-to-live (TTL) for trace events in the system. Changing this value can significantly impact the performance of the system by affecting the amount of memory consumed for storing trace data and the overhead for processing and managing trace events. Therefore, variations in the 'tracetype_query_ttl' value can lead to notable variations in system performance, making it a performance-sensitive configuration."
