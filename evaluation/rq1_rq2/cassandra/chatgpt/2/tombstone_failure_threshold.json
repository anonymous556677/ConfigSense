    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'tombstone_failure_threshold' in the Cassandra software project is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the system's ability to handle tombstone failures. A lower threshold may result in more tombstone failures, leading to increased read latency and potentially higher memory consumption. On the other hand, a higher threshold may delay the detection and handling of tombstone failures, impacting system performance as well. Therefore, changes in the value of this configuration can significantly affect system performance, making it performance-sensitive."
