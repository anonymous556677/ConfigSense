    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The enable_scripted_user_defined_functions configuration option in the Cassandra software project is performance-sensitive because enabling this feature allows users to write custom functions in scripting languages like JavaScript, which can significantly impact system performance. When scripted user-defined functions are enabled, the system needs to interpret and execute these scripts at runtime, leading to potential increases in execution time and memory consumption. Therefore, changes in the value of this configuration can have a notable effect on overall system performance."
