    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'index_summary_capacity_in_mb' in the Cassandra software project is performance-sensitive because changing its value can significantly impact the system's performance. This configuration controls the amount of memory allocated for index summaries, which directly affects the efficiency of index lookups and overall query performance. A higher value can lead to increased memory consumption and potentially slower query execution times, while a lower value may result in faster queries but could also cause increased disk I/O operations. Therefore, any changes to this configuration can have a noticeable impact on the system's performance."
