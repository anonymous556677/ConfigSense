    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'num_tokens' configuration in the Cassandra software project determines the number of tokens assigned to each node in the cluster, affecting the distribution of data across the cluster. A change in the 'num_tokens' value can significantly impact the performance of the system by altering the data distribution, potentially leading to uneven load distribution, increased network traffic, and varying latencies in read and write operations."
