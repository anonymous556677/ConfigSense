    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'server_encryption_options' configuration in the Cassandra software project is performance-sensitive because changing encryption options can significantly impact system performance. Encryption algorithms can introduce overhead in terms of CPU usage and memory consumption, leading to variations in execution time and overall system performance. Therefore, any changes to encryption options should be carefully considered to ensure optimal performance."
