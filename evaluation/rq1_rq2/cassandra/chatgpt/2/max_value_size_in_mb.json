    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'max_value_size_in_mb' in the Cassandra software project is performance-sensitive because changing this value can have a significant impact on system performance. Increasing the max value size can lead to increased memory consumption and potentially slower execution times, especially when dealing with large data sets. On the other hand, decreasing the max value size can improve performance by reducing memory usage and speeding up data processing. Therefore, any changes to this configuration option can have noticeable effects on the overall performance of the system."
