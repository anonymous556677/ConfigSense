    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The key_cache_keys_to_save configuration in Cassandra determines the number of keys to save in memory for the key cache. Changing this value can have a significant impact on system performance as it directly affects the efficiency of key lookups. Increasing the number of keys to save can improve read performance by reducing the number of disk accesses, while decreasing it can lead to more frequent disk reads and slower performance. Therefore, this configuration is considered performance-sensitive."
