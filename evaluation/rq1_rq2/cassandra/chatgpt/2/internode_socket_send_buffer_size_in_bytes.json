    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The internode_socket_send_buffer_size_in_bytes configuration in the Cassandra software project is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the communication between nodes in the cluster. Changing the value of this configuration can significantly affect the network throughput and latency, which in turn can impact the overall performance of the system. A larger buffer size may improve communication speed but also increase memory consumption, while a smaller buffer size may lead to slower communication and potential bottlenecks. Therefore, any changes to this configuration can have notable variations in execution time and memory consumption, making it a performance-sensitive configuration."
