    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'phi_convict_threshold' in the Cassandra software project is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the failure detection mechanism in the system. A change in the value of this configuration can significantly affect the time taken to detect and react to node failures, leading to variations in system performance and potentially affecting overall system stability and reliability."
