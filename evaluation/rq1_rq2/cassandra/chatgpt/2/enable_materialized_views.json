    "Reason": "The enable_materialized_views configuration option in the Cassandra software project is performance-sensitive because enabling materialized views can significantly impact system performance. Materialized views require additional storage and maintenance overhead, which can lead to increased memory consumption and potentially slower query execution times. Therefore, changing the value of this configuration can have a notable effect on system performance."
