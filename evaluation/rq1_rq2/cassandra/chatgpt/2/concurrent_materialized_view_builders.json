    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'concurrent_materialized_view_builders' in the 'cassandra' software project is performance-sensitive because changing its value can significantly impact system performance. Increasing the number of concurrent materialized view builders can lead to higher resource utilization, potentially causing contention and slowing down the overall execution time of the system. On the other hand, decreasing the number of concurrent builders may result in underutilization of resources and inefficient processing of materialized views. Therefore, any change in this configuration can have a notable effect on system performance."
