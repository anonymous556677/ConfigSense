    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'inter_dc_tcp_nodelay' configuration in the 'cassandra' software project is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the TCP connection behavior between data centers. Enabling TCP_NODELAY can reduce latency by disabling Nagle's algorithm, which can significantly improve the performance of inter-data center communication. Disabling TCP_NODELAY, on the other hand, can introduce delays and impact the overall system performance, especially in scenarios where low latency is crucial for data replication and consistency across data centers."
