    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'request_timeout_in_ms' in the 'cassandra' software project is performance-sensitive because changing its value can significantly impact the system's performance. A lower timeout value may lead to quicker response times but could also increase the likelihood of timeouts and retries, affecting overall system throughput. On the other hand, a higher timeout value may reduce the chances of timeouts but could result in longer response times and potentially higher resource consumption, impacting system performance as well."
