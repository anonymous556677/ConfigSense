    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'native_transport_max_frame_size_in_mb' in the Cassandra software project is performance-sensitive because changing its value can have a significant impact on system performance. This configuration determines the maximum frame size for native transport connections, and adjusting it can affect the amount of memory used for data transmission and processing. A higher value may lead to increased memory consumption and potentially slower execution times, while a lower value could improve performance by reducing memory overhead."
