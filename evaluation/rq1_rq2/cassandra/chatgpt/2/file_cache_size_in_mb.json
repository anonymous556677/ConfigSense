    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'file_cache_size_in_mb' configuration in the Cassandra software project is performance-sensitive because changing its value can have a significant impact on system performance. This configuration determines the size of the file cache used for storing frequently accessed data, and increasing or decreasing this size can directly affect the amount of memory consumed and the speed of read operations. A larger cache size may improve read performance but consume more memory, while a smaller cache size may lead to more frequent disk reads and slower performance."
