    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'native_transport_allow_older_protocols' configuration option in the Cassandra software project is performance-sensitive because changing its value can significantly impact system performance. Allowing older protocols may introduce compatibility issues or security vulnerabilities that can affect execution time and memory consumption. Therefore, any changes to this configuration should be carefully evaluated to ensure optimal system performance."
