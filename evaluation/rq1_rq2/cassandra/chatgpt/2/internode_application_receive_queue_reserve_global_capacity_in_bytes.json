    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'internode_application_receive_queue_reserve_global_capacity_in_bytes' in the Cassandra software project is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the capacity allocated for receiving application data between nodes. Changing this value can significantly affect the system's performance by either increasing or decreasing the amount of memory allocated for this purpose, leading to potential variations in execution time and overall system efficiency."
