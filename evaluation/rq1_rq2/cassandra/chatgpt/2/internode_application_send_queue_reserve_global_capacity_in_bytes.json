    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'internode_application_send_queue_reserve_global_capacity_in_bytes' in the 'cassandra' software project is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the global capacity for sending application data between nodes. Changing this value can significantly affect the system's network performance, potentially leading to variations in data transmission speeds and overall system throughput."
