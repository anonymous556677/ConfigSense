    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The internode_compression configuration option in the Cassandra software project is performance-sensitive. Changing the value of this configuration can significantly impact system performance by affecting the amount of data that needs to be compressed and decompressed during inter-node communication. This can lead to variations in execution time and memory consumption, making it a critical configuration for performance optimization."
