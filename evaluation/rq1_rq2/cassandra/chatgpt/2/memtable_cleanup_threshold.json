    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'memtable_cleanup_threshold' configuration in the Cassandra software project is performance-sensitive because changing its value can significantly impact the memory consumption of the system. This configuration determines the threshold at which memtables are flushed to disk, affecting the amount of memory used for in-memory data storage. A lower threshold may lead to more frequent flushes and increased memory usage, while a higher threshold may delay flushes and potentially cause memory pressure issues. Therefore, any change in the 'memtable_cleanup_threshold' value can have a noticeable impact on system performance in terms of memory utilization."
