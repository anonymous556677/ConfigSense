    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'auto_snapshot' configuration in the Cassandra software project is performance-sensitive because enabling or disabling automatic snapshots can have a significant impact on system performance. When auto_snapshot is enabled, the system will automatically take snapshots of data at regular intervals, which can consume additional resources such as CPU and disk space. This can lead to variations in execution time and memory consumption, making it a performance-sensitive configuration."
