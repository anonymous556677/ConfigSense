    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The enable_sasi_indexes configuration in the Cassandra project is performance-sensitive because enabling or disabling secondary indexes can have a significant impact on query performance. When secondary indexes are enabled, it can increase the execution time and memory consumption of queries that use those indexes. Therefore, changing the value of enable_sasi_indexes can result in notable variations in system performance."
