    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'diagnostic_events_enabled' configuration option in the Cassandra software project is performance-sensitive because enabling diagnostic events can significantly impact system performance. When diagnostic events are enabled, the system may generate additional logs or perform extra monitoring tasks, which can increase the execution time and memory consumption of the system. This additional overhead can cause notable variations in system performance, making this configuration option performance-sensitive."
