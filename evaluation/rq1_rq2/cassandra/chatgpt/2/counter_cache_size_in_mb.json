    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The counter_cache_size_in_mb configuration in the cassandra software project is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the memory consumption of the system. Increasing the counter cache size can lead to more data being stored in memory, potentially causing memory pressure and affecting overall system performance. Similarly, decreasing the counter cache size may result in less data being cached, leading to more frequent disk reads and slower performance. Therefore, changes to this configuration can significantly affect system performance, making it performance-sensitive."
