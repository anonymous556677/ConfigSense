    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'authenticator' configuration in the Cassandra software project is performance-sensitive because changing the authentication mechanism can significantly impact system performance. For example, using a more complex authentication method may increase the time taken for authentication, leading to slower overall system performance. Additionally, certain authentication mechanisms may require more memory resources, affecting memory consumption and potentially causing performance degradation."
