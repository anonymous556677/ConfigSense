    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The rpc_keepalive configuration in the Cassandra software project is performance-sensitive because changing its value can significantly impact the communication overhead between nodes in the cluster. A lower keepalive value may lead to more frequent connection checks, increasing network traffic and potentially affecting overall system performance. Conversely, a higher keepalive value may result in longer intervals between connection checks, which could impact the responsiveness and reliability of the system during node communication."
