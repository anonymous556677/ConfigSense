    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'cross_node_timeout' configuration in the Cassandra software project is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the communication and coordination between nodes in a distributed system. A change in the value of this configuration can significantly affect the overall system performance by potentially causing delays in data transmission, synchronization, and coordination among nodes. This can lead to increased latency, timeouts, and potential system instability, making it a critical configuration to consider for performance optimization."
