    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'counter_cache_keys_to_save' in the Cassandra software project is performance-sensitive because changing its value can significantly impact system performance. This configuration determines the number of keys to save in the counter cache, which directly affects memory consumption and cache efficiency. A higher value can lead to increased memory usage and potentially slower performance, while a lower value may result in cache misses and slower read operations."
