    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'internode_tcp_user_timeout_in_ms' in the 'cassandra' software project is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the timeout duration for inter-node communication over TCP. A change in this value can significantly affect the overall system performance, especially in a distributed environment where communication latency plays a crucial role in system responsiveness and throughput. A longer timeout may lead to increased delays in communication, potentially causing bottlenecks and performance degradation, while a shorter timeout may result in frequent connection failures and retries, impacting system stability and efficiency."
