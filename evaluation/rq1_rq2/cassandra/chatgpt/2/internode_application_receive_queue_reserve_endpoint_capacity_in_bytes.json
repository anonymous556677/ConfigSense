    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'internode_application_receive_queue_reserve_endpoint_capacity_in_bytes' in the 'cassandra' software project is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the capacity allocated for receiving data between nodes in the cluster. Changing this value can significantly affect the system's network throughput and latency, leading to variations in overall system performance."
