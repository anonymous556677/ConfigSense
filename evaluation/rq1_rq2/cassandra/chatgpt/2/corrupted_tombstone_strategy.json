    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'corrupted_tombstone_strategy' in the Cassandra software project is performance-sensitive because changing its value can significantly impact system performance. This configuration determines how Cassandra handles corrupted tombstones, which are markers for deleted data. Depending on the strategy chosen, it can affect the read and write performance of the system, as well as the overall storage and memory usage. Therefore, any changes to this configuration can lead to notable variations in execution time and memory consumption, making it a performance-sensitive option."
