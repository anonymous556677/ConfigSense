    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'streaming_connections_per_host' configuration in the Cassandra software project is performance-sensitive because changing its value can have a significant impact on system performance. This configuration determines the number of streaming connections allowed per host, and increasing or decreasing this value can directly affect the amount of network traffic and resources utilized during data streaming operations. A higher value may lead to increased network congestion and resource consumption, while a lower value may result in slower data transfer speeds. Therefore, any changes to this configuration can cause notable variations in execution time and overall system performance."
