    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'role_manager' configuration in the Cassandra software project is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the authentication and authorization processes within the system. Changes to the role_manager configuration can significantly affect the access control mechanisms, leading to variations in execution time and memory consumption during user authentication and authorization operations. Therefore, any modifications to the role_manager configuration should be carefully tested and monitored to ensure optimal system performance."
