    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'streaming_keep_alive_period_in_secs' configuration in the Cassandra software project is performance-sensitive because changing its value can significantly impact the streaming functionality of the system. A lower value may lead to more frequent keep-alive messages being sent, increasing network traffic and potentially affecting overall system performance. Conversely, a higher value may result in longer intervals between keep-alive messages, potentially causing delays in detecting network failures and impacting system reliability."
