    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'snapshot_before_compaction' in the Cassandra software project is performance-sensitive because changing its value can significantly impact system performance. When set to true, it causes the system to take a snapshot before compaction, which can increase memory consumption and execution time. This additional operation can lead to noticeable variations in system performance, making it a critical configuration to consider for performance optimization."
