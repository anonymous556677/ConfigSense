    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'file_cache_enabled' configuration option in the Cassandra software project is performance-sensitive because enabling or disabling file caching can have a significant impact on system performance. File caching affects how data is read and written to disk, which can directly impact the execution time and memory consumption of the system. Enabling file caching can improve read/write performance by storing frequently accessed data in memory, reducing disk I/O operations. On the other hand, disabling file caching can result in increased disk I/O operations, leading to slower performance and higher memory usage. Therefore, changes to the 'file_cache_enabled' configuration can cause notable variations in system performance, making it a performance-sensitive option."
