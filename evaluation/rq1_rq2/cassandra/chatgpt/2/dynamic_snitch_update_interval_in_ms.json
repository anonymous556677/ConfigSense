    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The dynamic_snitch_update_interval_in_ms configuration in the Cassandra software project is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the dynamic snitch behavior, which affects how nodes in the cluster are chosen for read and write operations. A small change in this configuration value can lead to significant variations in node selection and ultimately impact system performance in terms of latency and throughput."
