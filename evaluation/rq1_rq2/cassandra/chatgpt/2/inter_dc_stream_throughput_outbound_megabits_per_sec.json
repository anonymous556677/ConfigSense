    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'inter_dc_stream_throughput_outbound_megabits_per_sec' in the 'cassandra' software project is performance-sensitive because changing its value can significantly impact the throughput of data transfer between data centers. This can directly affect system performance by either increasing or decreasing the overall latency and throughput of data replication, leading to notable variations in execution time and resource utilization."
