    "Reason": "The disk_failure_policy configuration in the Cassandra software project is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the system's data durability and fault tolerance mechanisms. Changing this configuration can significantly affect the system's performance by determining how data is replicated and stored, which can lead to variations in execution time and resource consumption."
