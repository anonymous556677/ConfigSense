    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'internode_application_send_queue_capacity_in_bytes' in the 'cassandra' software project is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the capacity for sending application data between nodes. A change in this value can significantly affect the throughput and latency of inter-node communication, leading to notable variations in system performance such as increased message queuing, delays in data transmission, and potential bottlenecks in the network communication."
