    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The initial_token configuration in the Cassandra software project is performance-sensitive because it determines the initial token for the partitioner, which in turn affects the distribution of data across the cluster. Changing the initial_token value can significantly impact the data distribution, potentially leading to uneven workload distribution and performance bottlenecks in the system."
