    "Reason": "The 'audit_logging_options' configuration in the Cassandra software project is performance-sensitive because enabling audit logging can significantly impact system performance. Audit logging involves writing logs for each operation, which can increase execution time and memory consumption. The additional overhead of logging can slow down the system and consume more resources, affecting overall performance."
