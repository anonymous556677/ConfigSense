    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'transparent_data_encryption_options' configuration in the Cassandra software project is performance-sensitive because enabling transparent data encryption can significantly impact system performance. Encrypting data at rest can increase CPU usage, memory consumption, and disk I/O, leading to notable variations in execution time and overall system performance."
