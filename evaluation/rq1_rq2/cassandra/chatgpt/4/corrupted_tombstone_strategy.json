    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'corrupted_tombstone_strategy' configuration in the Cassandra software project is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the handling of corrupted tombstones, which can affect read and write operations, potentially leading to increased execution time and memory consumption. Inefficient handling of corrupted tombstones can result in additional processing overhead and resource utilization, making it a critical configuration for system performance."
