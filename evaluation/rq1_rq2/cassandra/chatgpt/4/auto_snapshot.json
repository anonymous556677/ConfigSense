    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'auto_snapshot' configuration in the Cassandra software project is performance-sensitive because enabling or disabling automatic snapshots can have a significant impact on system performance. When auto_snapshot is enabled, the system will automatically take snapshots of data at regular intervals, which can consume additional system resources and affect overall performance. Disabling auto_snapshot can reduce the overhead of taking snapshots and improve system performance. Therefore, the value change of this configuration option can lead to notable variations in execution time and memory consumption."
