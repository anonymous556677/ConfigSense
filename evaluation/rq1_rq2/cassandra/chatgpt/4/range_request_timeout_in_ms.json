    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'range_request_timeout_in_ms' in the Cassandra software project is performance-sensitive because changing its value can significantly impact system performance. This configuration determines the timeout for range requests, which can affect the overall response time and throughput of the system. A lower timeout value may lead to increased request failures and retries, while a higher timeout value may result in longer response times and potentially higher memory consumption due to increased resource usage during longer request processing."
