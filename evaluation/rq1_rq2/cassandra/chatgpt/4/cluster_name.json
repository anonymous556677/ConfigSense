    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'cluster_name' configuration in the Cassandra software project is performance-sensitive because changing the cluster name can impact the distribution of data across nodes in the cluster, affecting data replication, load balancing, and overall system performance. A different cluster name may lead to uneven data distribution, increased network traffic, and potential bottlenecks, all of which can significantly impact system performance."
