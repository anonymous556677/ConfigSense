    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'initial_token' configuration in the Cassandra software project is performance-sensitive because it determines the starting token for the partitioner, which can significantly impact the distribution of data across nodes in the cluster. A change in the initial token value can lead to uneven data distribution, affecting query performance and overall system throughput."
