    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'internode_tcp_connect_timeout_in_ms' in the 'cassandra' software project is performance-sensitive because changing its value can significantly impact the communication latency between nodes in a distributed system. A longer timeout can lead to delays in establishing connections, affecting overall system performance, while a shorter timeout can result in frequent connection failures and retries, also impacting performance. Therefore, the value of this configuration can have notable variations in execution time and system responsiveness."
