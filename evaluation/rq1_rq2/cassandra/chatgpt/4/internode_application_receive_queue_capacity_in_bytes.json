    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'internode_application_receive_queue_capacity_in_bytes' in the 'cassandra' software project is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the capacity for receiving application data between nodes. A change in this value can significantly affect the system's ability to handle incoming data efficiently, leading to potential bottlenecks, delays in data processing, and increased memory consumption. Therefore, monitoring and optimizing this configuration is crucial for maintaining optimal system performance."
