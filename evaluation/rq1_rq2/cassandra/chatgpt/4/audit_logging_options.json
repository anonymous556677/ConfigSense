    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The audit_logging_options configuration in the Cassandra software project is performance-sensitive because enabling audit logging can significantly impact system performance. When audit logging is enabled, the system needs to write additional logs for each operation, which can increase the execution time and memory consumption. This extra overhead can lead to notable variations in system performance, making this configuration performance-sensitive."
