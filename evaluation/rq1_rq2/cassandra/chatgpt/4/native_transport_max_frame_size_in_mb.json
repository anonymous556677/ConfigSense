    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'native_transport_max_frame_size_in_mb' in the Cassandra software project is performance-sensitive because changing its value can significantly impact system performance. This configuration determines the maximum frame size for native transport, affecting the efficiency of data transfer and potentially leading to variations in execution time and memory consumption."
