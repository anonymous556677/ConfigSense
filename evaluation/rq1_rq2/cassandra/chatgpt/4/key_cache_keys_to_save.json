    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'key_cache_keys_to_save' configuration in the Cassandra software project is performance-sensitive because changing its value can significantly impact system performance. This configuration determines the number of keys to save in the key cache, which directly affects the efficiency of key lookups and overall system performance. A higher value can lead to increased memory consumption and slower key lookups, while a lower value can result in more frequent cache misses and slower performance."
