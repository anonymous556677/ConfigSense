    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'tombstone_failure_threshold' in the Cassandra software project is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the read performance of the system. A lower threshold may result in increased tombstone creation, leading to slower read operations and increased memory consumption. Conversely, a higher threshold may delay tombstone creation, potentially impacting write performance and overall system stability."
