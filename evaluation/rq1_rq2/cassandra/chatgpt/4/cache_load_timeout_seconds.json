    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'cache_load_timeout_seconds' in the 'cassandra' software project is performance-sensitive because changing its value can significantly impact system performance. A lower value may lead to faster cache loading times but could also increase the risk of cache misses, resulting in higher latency and potentially increased memory consumption. On the other hand, a higher value may reduce the risk of cache misses but could also lead to longer cache loading times and potentially slower overall system performance."
