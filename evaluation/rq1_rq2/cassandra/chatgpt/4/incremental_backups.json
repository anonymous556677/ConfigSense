    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'incremental_backups' configuration option in the Cassandra software project is performance-sensitive because enabling incremental backups can significantly impact system performance. Incremental backups involve tracking changes since the last backup, which can increase CPU and memory usage during the backup process. This can lead to notable variations in execution time and memory consumption, making it a performance-sensitive configuration option."
