    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The dynamic_snitch_reset_interval_in_ms configuration in the Cassandra software project is performance-sensitive because it determines how often the dynamic snitch algorithm resets its internal state, affecting how nodes are perceived in the cluster. A lower value can lead to more frequent adjustments in node rankings, potentially impacting query routing and load balancing decisions, while a higher value may result in slower adaptation to changing node performance, impacting overall system performance."
