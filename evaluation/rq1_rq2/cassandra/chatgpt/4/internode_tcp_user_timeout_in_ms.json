    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The internode_tcp_user_timeout_in_ms configuration in the Cassandra software project is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the timeout duration for inter-node communication over TCP. A change in this value can significantly affect the overall system performance, especially in a distributed environment where communication between nodes is crucial for the system's operation. A longer timeout may lead to delays in communication and potential performance bottlenecks, while a shorter timeout may result in increased retransmissions and resource consumption. Therefore, any modification to this configuration can have a notable impact on system performance, making it a performance-sensitive parameter."
