    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'internode_application_send_queue_capacity_in_bytes' in the 'cassandra' software project is performance-sensitive. This configuration directly impacts the amount of data that can be sent between nodes in the cluster, affecting network utilization and potentially leading to bottlenecks or delays in data transmission. A change in this value can significantly impact system performance by either improving or degrading the overall throughput and latency of the system."
