    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'file_cache_enabled' configuration option in the Cassandra software project is performance-sensitive because enabling or disabling file caching can have a significant impact on system performance. When file caching is enabled, it can reduce disk I/O operations and improve read performance by storing frequently accessed data in memory. On the other hand, disabling file caching can lead to increased disk I/O operations and slower read performance, affecting overall system performance."
