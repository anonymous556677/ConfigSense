    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'counter_cache_keys_to_save' in the Cassandra software project is performance-sensitive because changing its value can significantly impact system performance. This configuration determines the number of counter cache keys to save, and a higher value can increase memory consumption and potentially slow down read and write operations. Therefore, any change in this configuration can lead to notable variations in execution time and memory usage, making it performance-sensitive."
