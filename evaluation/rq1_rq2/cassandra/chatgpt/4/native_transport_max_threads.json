    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The native_transport_max_threads configuration in Cassandra determines the maximum number of threads that can be used for handling incoming client connections. Changing this value can have a significant impact on system performance, as it directly affects the concurrency and throughput of client requests. Increasing the number of threads can improve performance by allowing more simultaneous connections to be processed, but it can also lead to increased resource consumption and potential contention for system resources. Conversely, decreasing the number of threads may reduce resource usage but can also result in slower response times for client requests. Therefore, the native_transport_max_threads configuration is considered performance-sensitive due to its direct impact on system performance metrics such as throughput, response time, and resource utilization."
