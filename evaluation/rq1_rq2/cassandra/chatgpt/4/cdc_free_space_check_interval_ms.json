    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'cdc_free_space_check_interval_ms' in the Cassandra software project is performance-sensitive. This configuration determines how frequently the system checks for free space in the commit log directory for change data capture (CDC) operations. A lower value for this configuration can lead to more frequent checks for free space, potentially impacting system performance by increasing the overhead of these checks. Conversely, a higher value may lead to delayed detection of low free space, which can result in performance degradation or system failures. Therefore, changes in the value of 'cdc_free_space_check_interval_ms' can significantly affect system performance, making it a performance-sensitive configuration."
