    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'streaming_keep_alive_period_in_secs' in the 'cassandra' software project is performance-sensitive because changing its value can significantly impact the system's performance. A lower value may result in more frequent keep-alive messages being sent, increasing network traffic and potentially affecting overall system performance. On the other hand, a higher value may lead to longer intervals between keep-alive messages, which could impact the system's ability to detect and handle failures in a timely manner, affecting system reliability and performance."
