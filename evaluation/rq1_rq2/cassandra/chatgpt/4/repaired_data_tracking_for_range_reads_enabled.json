    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'repaired_data_tracking_for_range_reads_enabled' in the Cassandra software project is performance-sensitive because enabling this option can significantly impact system performance. When enabled, the system tracks repaired data for range reads, which can increase memory consumption and potentially slow down execution time due to the additional overhead of tracking and managing this data. Therefore, changing the value of this configuration option can lead to notable variations in system performance."
