    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'cas_contention_timeout_in_ms' in the 'cassandra' software project is performance-sensitive because changing its value can significantly impact the system's performance. This configuration determines the timeout for contention during compare-and-swap operations, and a lower timeout can lead to increased contention and longer execution times, while a higher timeout can reduce contention but may also increase memory consumption. Therefore, any change in this configuration can have notable variations in execution time and memory usage, making it performance-sensitive."
