    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'enable_scripted_user_defined_functions' in the Cassandra software project is performance-sensitive because enabling scripted user-defined functions can significantly impact system performance. Scripted user-defined functions introduce additional complexity and overhead to the system, potentially leading to notable variations in execution time and memory consumption. Therefore, changes in the value of this configuration can have a significant impact on overall system performance."
