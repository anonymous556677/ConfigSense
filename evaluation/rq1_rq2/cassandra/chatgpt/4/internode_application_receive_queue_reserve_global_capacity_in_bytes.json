    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'internode_application_receive_queue_reserve_global_capacity_in_bytes' in the 'cassandra' software project is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the global capacity for receiving application data between nodes. Changing this value can significantly affect the system's ability to handle incoming data efficiently, leading to potential bottlenecks in data processing and communication between nodes, ultimately impacting system performance."
