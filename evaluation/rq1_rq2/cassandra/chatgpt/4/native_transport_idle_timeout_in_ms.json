    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The native_transport_idle_timeout_in_ms configuration in the Cassandra software project is performance-sensitive because changing its value can significantly impact the system's performance. This configuration determines the timeout for idle connections, and a lower value can lead to faster connection termination but may also increase the overhead of establishing new connections. On the other hand, a higher value can result in longer idle connections, potentially affecting system resources and performance. Therefore, any change in this configuration can have notable variations in execution time and memory consumption, making it performance-sensitive."
