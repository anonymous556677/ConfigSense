    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'max_value_size_in_mb' in the Cassandra software project is performance-sensitive because changing this value can significantly impact system performance. Increasing the maximum value size may lead to higher memory consumption and slower execution times, especially when dealing with large data sets. On the other hand, decreasing the maximum value size may improve performance by reducing memory usage and speeding up data processing. Therefore, any change in the 'max_value_size_in_mb' configuration can have a notable effect on system performance."
