    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The enable_sasi_indexes configuration in the cassandra software project is performance-sensitive because enabling SASI (SSTable Attached Secondary Indexes) indexes can significantly impact system performance. When SASI indexes are enabled, it can increase the amount of disk space and memory consumption required for indexing, leading to potential performance degradation in terms of query response time and overall system throughput."
