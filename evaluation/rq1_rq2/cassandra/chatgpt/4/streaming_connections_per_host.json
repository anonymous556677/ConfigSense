    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'streaming_connections_per_host' configuration in the Cassandra software project is performance-sensitive because changing its value can significantly impact system performance. This configuration determines the number of streaming connections allowed per host, and increasing or decreasing this value can directly affect the network traffic and resource utilization on the system. A higher value may lead to increased network congestion and resource consumption, impacting overall system performance, while a lower value may limit the system's ability to handle concurrent streaming connections efficiently."
