    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'index_summary_resize_interval_in_minutes' in the 'cassandra' software project is performance-sensitive because changing its value can significantly impact the system performance. This configuration controls the interval at which the index summary is resized, affecting the efficiency of index maintenance and lookup operations. A smaller interval may lead to more frequent resizing, increasing memory consumption and potentially slowing down query performance. On the other hand, a larger interval may delay resizing, impacting the responsiveness of index updates and queries. Therefore, any change in this configuration can have noticeable effects on system performance."
