    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The role_manager configuration in the Cassandra software project is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the access control and authorization mechanisms within the system. Changes to the role_manager configuration can lead to significant variations in the time taken to authenticate and authorize users, which can affect overall system performance. Additionally, if the role_manager configuration is not optimized for efficient access control, it can result in increased memory consumption and slower execution times for operations that require authentication and authorization checks."
