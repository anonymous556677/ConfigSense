    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The ideal_consistency_level configuration in Cassandra determines the level of consistency required for read and write operations. Changing this configuration can have a significant impact on system performance, as it directly affects the trade-off between consistency and performance. Setting a higher consistency level can increase latency and reduce throughput, while a lower consistency level can lead to data inconsistency but improve performance. Therefore, any change in the ideal_consistency_level configuration can result in notable variations in execution time and overall system performance."
