    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'internode_application_send_queue_reserve_global_capacity_in_bytes' in the 'cassandra' software project is performance-sensitive because changing its value can significantly impact the system's network communication efficiency. A higher value may lead to increased memory consumption and longer execution times, while a lower value may result in potential network congestion and slower data transfer rates between nodes, ultimately affecting overall system performance."
