    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'num_tokens' configuration in the Cassandra software project is performance-sensitive because changing the number of tokens significantly impacts the distribution of data across the cluster nodes. This can affect the load balancing, data replication, and overall performance of the system. A higher number of tokens can lead to more data movement and increased network traffic, while a lower number of tokens can result in uneven data distribution and potential hotspots. Therefore, any changes to the 'num_tokens' configuration can have a noticeable impact on system performance."
