    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'concurrent_materialized_view_builders' configuration in the Cassandra software project is performance-sensitive because changing its value can significantly impact system performance. This configuration determines the number of concurrent threads used for building materialized views, and increasing the number of concurrent builders can lead to higher CPU and memory usage, potentially affecting overall system performance and throughput."
