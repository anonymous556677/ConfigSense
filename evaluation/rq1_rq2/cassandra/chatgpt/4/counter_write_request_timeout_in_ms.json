    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'counter_write_request_timeout_in_ms' in the 'cassandra' software project is performance-sensitive because changing its value can significantly impact the system's performance. For example, increasing the timeout may lead to longer response times for write requests, affecting overall system throughput and latency. On the other hand, decreasing the timeout may result in more frequent request failures or retries, impacting system stability and resource utilization."
