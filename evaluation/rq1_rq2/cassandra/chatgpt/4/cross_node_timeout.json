    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'cross_node_timeout' configuration in the Cassandra software project is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the communication and coordination between nodes in a distributed system. A change in the value of this configuration can lead to significant delays in cross-node communication, potentially causing timeouts and increased latency in data transfer between nodes. This can result in degraded system performance and overall slower response times for queries and data operations."
