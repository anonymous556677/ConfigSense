    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'tracetype_query_ttl' in the Cassandra software project is performance-sensitive because changing its value can significantly impact system performance. This configuration determines the time-to-live (TTL) for query tracing data, which directly affects the amount of memory consumed and the overhead for tracing queries. A lower TTL value can reduce memory consumption but increase the frequency of trace data writes, potentially impacting system performance. Conversely, a higher TTL value can decrease the frequency of trace data writes but increase memory consumption, also affecting system performance. Therefore, any change in the 'tracetype_query_ttl' configuration can lead to notable variations in execution time and memory consumption, making it performance-sensitive."
