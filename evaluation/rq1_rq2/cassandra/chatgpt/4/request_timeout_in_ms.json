    "Reason": "The configuration option 'request_timeout_in_ms' in the Cassandra software project is performance-sensitive because changing its value can significantly impact the system's response time. A lower timeout value may lead to quicker request failures, while a higher timeout value may cause delays in request processing, both of which can affect overall system performance."
