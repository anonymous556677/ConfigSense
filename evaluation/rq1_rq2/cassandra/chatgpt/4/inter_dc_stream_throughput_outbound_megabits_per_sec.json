    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'inter_dc_stream_throughput_outbound_megabits_per_sec' in the Cassandra software project is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the throughput of data being sent between data centers. Changing this value can significantly affect the overall system performance by either increasing or decreasing the amount of data being transferred, leading to variations in execution time and resource consumption."
