    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The internode_compression configuration option in the Cassandra software project is performance-sensitive because changing its value can significantly impact system performance. Enabling compression can reduce the amount of data transmitted between nodes, leading to lower network bandwidth usage and potentially faster communication. However, the compression and decompression processes can also introduce additional CPU overhead, which may affect overall system performance, especially in high-throughput scenarios."
