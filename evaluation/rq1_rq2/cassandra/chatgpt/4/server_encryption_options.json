    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The server_encryption_options configuration in the Cassandra project is performance-sensitive because changing the encryption options can significantly impact system performance. Encryption/decryption processes can consume additional CPU resources and memory, leading to variations in execution time and memory consumption. Therefore, any changes to the encryption options can have a notable effect on the overall performance of the system."
