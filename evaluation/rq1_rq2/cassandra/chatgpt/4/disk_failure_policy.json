    "Reason": "The disk_failure_policy configuration in the Cassandra software project is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the system's data durability and fault tolerance mechanisms. Changing this configuration can significantly affect the system's performance by altering how data is replicated and stored on disk, leading to potential variations in execution time and memory consumption."
