    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'file_cache_size_in_mb' configuration in the Cassandra software project is performance-sensitive because changing its value can significantly impact system performance. This configuration determines the size of the file cache in memory, which directly affects the efficiency of reading and writing data to and from disk. A larger file cache size can improve read performance by reducing the frequency of disk accesses, while a smaller size may lead to increased disk I/O operations and slower data retrieval. Therefore, any changes to this configuration can have a noticeable impact on execution time and memory consumption."
