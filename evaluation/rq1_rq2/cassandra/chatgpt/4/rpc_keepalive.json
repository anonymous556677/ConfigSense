    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The rpc_keepalive configuration option in the Cassandra software project is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the communication and connection management between nodes in the cluster. Changing the value of rpc_keepalive can significantly affect the overall system performance by influencing the frequency of keep-alive messages exchanged between nodes, which in turn can impact the latency and throughput of data transfer operations. Therefore, any notable variations in the rpc_keepalive setting can lead to noticeable changes in system performance metrics such as response times and resource utilization."
