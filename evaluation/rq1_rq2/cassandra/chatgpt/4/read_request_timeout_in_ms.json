    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option read_request_timeout_in_ms in the Cassandra software project is performance-sensitive because changing its value can directly impact the response time of read requests. A lower timeout value may result in faster response times but could also lead to increased request failures, while a higher timeout value may increase response times but could also lead to potential resource wastage. Therefore, any change in this configuration can significantly affect the overall system performance."
