    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'cross_node_timeout' in the Cassandra software project is performance-sensitive because changing its value can significantly impact the communication and coordination between nodes in a distributed system. A longer timeout may lead to increased latency in cross-node communication, affecting overall system performance, while a shorter timeout may result in more frequent timeouts and retries, also impacting performance. Therefore, the value of 'cross_node_timeout' has a notable effect on system performance and is considered performance-sensitive."
