    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The disk_failure_policy configuration in the Cassandra software project determines how the system responds to disk failures. A change in this configuration can have a significant impact on system performance, as it directly affects data storage and replication strategies. For example, setting a more aggressive disk_failure_policy may increase the replication factor, leading to higher disk usage and potentially impacting read and write performance. Therefore, this configuration is considered performance-sensitive."
