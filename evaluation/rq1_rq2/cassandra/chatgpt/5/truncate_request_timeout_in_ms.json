    "Reason": "The configuration option 'truncate_request_timeout_in_ms' in the Cassandra software project is performance-sensitive because changing its value can significantly impact the system's performance. This configuration determines the timeout for truncating requests, and a longer timeout can lead to increased memory consumption and potentially longer execution times, affecting overall system performance."
