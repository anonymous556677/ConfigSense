    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'counter_cache_keys_to_save' in the Cassandra software project is performance-sensitive because changing its value can significantly impact system performance. This configuration determines the number of counter cache keys to save, which directly affects memory consumption and cache efficiency. A higher value can lead to increased memory usage and potentially slower performance, while a lower value may result in cache misses and decreased performance."
