    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The enable_sasi_indexes configuration in the Cassandra software project is performance-sensitive because enabling SASI indexes can significantly impact system performance by increasing the amount of memory consumption and potentially slowing down query execution times. SASI indexes are known to consume more memory and may require additional resources for indexing and querying, which can affect overall system performance."
