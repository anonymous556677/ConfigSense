    "Reason": "The 'windows_timer_interval' configuration in the Cassandra software project is performance-sensitive because changing its value can significantly impact system performance. This configuration determines the interval at which Windows timers are fired, affecting the timing and scheduling of various system tasks. A lower timer interval may lead to more frequent context switches and higher CPU usage, while a higher interval may cause delays in timer-based operations, impacting overall system responsiveness and performance."
