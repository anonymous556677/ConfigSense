    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'audit_logging_options' configuration in the Cassandra software project is performance-sensitive because enabling audit logging can significantly impact system performance. Writing audit logs to disk or sending them over the network can increase execution time and memory consumption, especially in high-traffic environments. This additional overhead can cause notable variations in system performance, making it a performance-sensitive configuration."
