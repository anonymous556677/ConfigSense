    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'native_transport_max_frame_size_in_mb' in the Cassandra project is performance-sensitive because changing its value can significantly impact the network performance of the system. A larger frame size can lead to increased network overhead and potential bottlenecks, while a smaller frame size can result in more frequent network packets and increased processing overhead. Therefore, any change in this configuration can have a notable effect on overall system performance."
