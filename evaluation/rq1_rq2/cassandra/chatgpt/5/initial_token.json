    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'initial_token' configuration in the Cassandra software project is performance-sensitive because it determines the starting token for the partitioner, which directly impacts the distribution of data across the cluster. Changing the initial_token value can lead to significant variations in data distribution, affecting system performance in terms of data access latency and overall cluster stability."
