    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'tracetype_query_ttl' in the Cassandra project is performance-sensitive because changing its value can significantly impact the system's performance. This configuration determines the time-to-live (TTL) for query tracing data, which directly affects the amount of memory consumed and the overhead of tracing queries. A lower TTL value can reduce memory consumption but increase the frequency of trace data flushing, potentially impacting system performance. Conversely, a higher TTL value can lead to increased memory usage but less frequent trace data flushing, affecting performance in a different way. Therefore, any change in the 'tracetype_query_ttl' configuration can have a noticeable impact on system performance."
