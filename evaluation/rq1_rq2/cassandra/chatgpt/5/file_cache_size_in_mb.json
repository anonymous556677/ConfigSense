    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'file_cache_size_in_mb' configuration in the Cassandra software project is performance-sensitive because changing its value can significantly impact system performance. This configuration determines the amount of memory allocated for file caching, which directly affects read and write operations on disk. Increasing the file cache size can improve read performance by reducing disk I/O operations, while decreasing it can lead to more frequent disk accesses and slower read/write operations. Therefore, changes in this configuration can cause notable variations in execution time and memory consumption, making it performance-sensitive."
