    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'enable_scripted_user_defined_functions' in the Cassandra software project is performance-sensitive because enabling scripted user-defined functions can significantly impact system performance. Scripted functions introduce additional overhead in terms of execution time and memory consumption, as the system needs to interpret and execute the scripts at runtime. This can lead to notable variations in execution time and resource utilization, making it a performance-sensitive configuration."
