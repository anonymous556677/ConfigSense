    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The dynamic_snitch_reset_interval_in_ms configuration in the Cassandra software project is performance-sensitive because changing its value can significantly impact the system's performance. This configuration determines how often the dynamic snitch resets its internal state, affecting how nodes are perceived in the cluster. A lower interval may lead to more frequent adjustments in node rankings, potentially impacting query routing and overall system stability. Conversely, a higher interval may result in outdated node information, leading to suboptimal performance. Therefore, any changes to this configuration can have notable variations in query response times and cluster efficiency."
