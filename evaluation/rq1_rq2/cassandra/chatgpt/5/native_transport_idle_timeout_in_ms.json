    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The native_transport_idle_timeout_in_ms configuration in the Cassandra software project is performance-sensitive because its value directly impacts the idle timeout for native transport connections. A lower timeout value can lead to more frequent connection closures and reconnections, potentially affecting system performance by increasing latency and resource consumption. On the other hand, a higher timeout value can result in longer idle periods for connections, which may also impact performance by tying up resources unnecessarily. Therefore, any change in the native_transport_idle_timeout_in_ms configuration can significantly affect system performance, making it a performance-sensitive configuration."
