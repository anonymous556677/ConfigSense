    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'phi_convict_threshold' in the Cassandra software project is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the failure detection mechanism in the system. Changing the value of this configuration can significantly affect the system's ability to detect and handle node failures, leading to variations in system performance, such as increased response time or resource consumption."
