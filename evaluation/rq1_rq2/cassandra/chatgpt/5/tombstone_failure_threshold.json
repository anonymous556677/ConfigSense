    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'tombstone_failure_threshold' in the Cassandra software project is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the system's ability to handle tombstone failures. A low threshold may result in increased tombstone creation and compaction overhead, leading to degraded system performance. On the other hand, a high threshold may delay tombstone removal, causing increased memory consumption and potentially impacting read performance. Therefore, changes to this configuration can significantly affect system performance in terms of execution time and memory usage."
