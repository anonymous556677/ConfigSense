    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'incremental_backups' configuration option in the Cassandra software project is performance-sensitive because enabling incremental backups can significantly impact system performance. Incremental backups involve only backing up data that has changed since the last backup, which can result in increased CPU and I/O usage during the backup process. This can lead to variations in execution time and memory consumption, making it a performance-sensitive configuration option."
