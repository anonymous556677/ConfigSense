    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'cluster_name' configuration in the Cassandra software project is performance-sensitive because changing the cluster name can impact the distribution of data across nodes in the cluster, affecting the overall performance of the system. A different cluster name may lead to changes in data replication, load balancing, and communication patterns, ultimately impacting system performance in terms of latency and throughput."
