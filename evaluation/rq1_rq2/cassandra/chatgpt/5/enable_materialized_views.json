    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The enable_materialized_views configuration in the Cassandra software project is performance-sensitive because enabling materialized views can have a significant impact on system performance. Materialized views consume additional memory and can increase query execution time, especially for complex queries or when dealing with a large amount of data. Therefore, changing the value of this configuration can lead to notable variations in execution time and memory consumption, making it performance-sensitive."
