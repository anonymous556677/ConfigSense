    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'range_request_timeout_in_ms' in the Cassandra software project is performance-sensitive because changing its value can significantly impact the system's performance. This configuration determines the timeout for range requests, which can affect the overall response time and throughput of the system. A lower timeout value may lead to increased request failures and retries, while a higher timeout value may result in longer response times and increased resource consumption."
