    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option cdc_total_space_in_mb in the Cassandra software project is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the amount of space allocated for change data capture (CDC) logs. A significant change in this value can lead to variations in memory consumption and potentially affect system performance, especially in scenarios where a large amount of CDC data needs to be stored."
