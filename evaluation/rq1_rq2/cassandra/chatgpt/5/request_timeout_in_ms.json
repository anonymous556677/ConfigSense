    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'request_timeout_in_ms' in the Cassandra software project is performance-sensitive because changing its value can significantly impact the system's response time. A lower timeout value may lead to quicker request timeouts, affecting overall system performance, while a higher timeout value may result in longer response times and potential resource wastage."
