    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'streaming_connections_per_host' configuration in the Cassandra software project is performance-sensitive because changing its value can significantly impact system performance. This configuration determines the number of streaming connections allowed per host, and increasing or decreasing this value can lead to notable variations in network traffic, resource utilization, and overall system throughput. Therefore, any changes to this configuration can have a direct impact on the system's performance and scalability."
