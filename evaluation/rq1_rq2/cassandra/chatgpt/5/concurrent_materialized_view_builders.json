    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'concurrent_materialized_view_builders' in the Cassandra software project is performance-sensitive because changing its value can significantly impact system performance. Increasing the number of concurrent materialized view builders can lead to higher CPU and memory usage, potentially causing contention and slowing down query processing. On the other hand, decreasing the number of builders may result in slower materialized view updates and overall system performance degradation."
