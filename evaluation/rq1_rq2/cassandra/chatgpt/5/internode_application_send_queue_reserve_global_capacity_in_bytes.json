    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'internode_application_send_queue_reserve_global_capacity_in_bytes' in the 'cassandra' software project is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the global capacity allocated for sending application data between nodes. A change in this value can significantly affect the system's network performance, potentially leading to delays in data transmission and overall system throughput. Therefore, monitoring and optimizing this configuration is crucial for maintaining optimal system performance."
