    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'auto_snapshot' configuration option in the Cassandra software project is performance-sensitive because enabling automatic snapshots can significantly impact system performance by increasing disk I/O operations and consuming additional storage space. This can lead to variations in execution time and memory consumption, especially in scenarios where frequent snapshots are taken."
