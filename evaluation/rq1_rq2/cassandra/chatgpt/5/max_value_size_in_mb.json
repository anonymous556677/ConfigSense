    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'max_value_size_in_mb' configuration in the Cassandra software project is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the memory consumption of the system. Increasing the value of this configuration can lead to a significant increase in memory usage, potentially causing memory pressure and impacting overall system performance. Similarly, decreasing the value may result in better memory management and improved performance. Therefore, changes to this configuration can have a notable effect on system performance, making it a performance-sensitive parameter."
