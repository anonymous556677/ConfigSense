    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'internode_application_receive_queue_reserve_global_capacity_in_bytes' in the 'cassandra' software project is performance-sensitive because changing its value can significantly impact the system's performance. This configuration directly affects the capacity allocated for receiving application data between nodes, and a change in this value can lead to notable variations in network throughput and latency, ultimately impacting the overall system performance."
