    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'diagnostic_events_enabled' configuration option in the Cassandra software project is performance-sensitive because enabling diagnostic events can significantly impact system performance. When diagnostic events are enabled, additional logging and monitoring activities are triggered, which can consume extra CPU and memory resources. This increased overhead can lead to notable variations in execution time and memory consumption, affecting the overall performance of the system."
