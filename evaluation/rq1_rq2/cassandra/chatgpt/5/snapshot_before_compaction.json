    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'snapshot_before_compaction' in the Cassandra software project is performance-sensitive because changing its value can significantly impact system performance. When set to true, it triggers snapshots before compaction, which can increase the amount of data that needs to be processed and stored, leading to potential variations in execution time and memory consumption. This can have a noticeable impact on overall system performance, making it a performance-sensitive configuration."
