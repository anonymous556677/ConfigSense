    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option internode_application_receive_queue_reserve_endpoint_capacity_in_bytes in the cassandra software project is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the capacity allocated for receiving data between nodes. Changing this value can significantly affect the system's performance by either increasing or decreasing the amount of data that can be processed, leading to variations in execution time and memory consumption."
