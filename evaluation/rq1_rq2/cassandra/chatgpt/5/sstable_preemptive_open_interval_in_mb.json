    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option sstable_preemptive_open_interval_in_mb in the Cassandra project is performance-sensitive because changing its value can significantly impact system performance. This configuration determines the size of the memtable that triggers the preemptive opening of SSTables, affecting the efficiency of read and write operations, as well as memory consumption. A small value may lead to frequent SSTable openings, increasing latency, while a large value may result in higher memory usage and potential performance degradation."
