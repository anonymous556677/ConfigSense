    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'num_tokens' configuration in the Cassandra software project determines the number of tokens used for partitioning data in the cluster. Changing the value of 'num_tokens' can significantly impact the distribution of data across nodes, which can in turn affect system performance by influencing data locality, load balancing, and query performance. Therefore, this configuration is considered performance-sensitive."
