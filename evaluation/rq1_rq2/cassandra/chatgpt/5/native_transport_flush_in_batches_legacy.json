    "Reason": "The configuration option 'native_transport_flush_in_batches_legacy' in the Cassandra software project is performance-sensitive because changing its value can significantly impact the system's performance. This configuration controls how data is flushed to disk during native transport operations, and altering it can lead to notable variations in execution time and memory consumption, affecting overall system performance."
