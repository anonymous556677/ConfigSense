    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'internode_streaming_tcp_user_timeout_in_ms' in the 'cassandra' software project is performance-sensitive because changing its value can significantly impact the communication and data transfer between nodes in the cluster. A lower timeout value may lead to faster detection of unresponsive nodes but could also result in increased retransmissions and overall system latency. On the other hand, a higher timeout value may reduce the frequency of false positives but could potentially delay the detection of actual node failures, impacting system availability and performance."
