    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'inter_dc_stream_throughput_outbound_megabits_per_sec' in the 'cassandra' software project is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the throughput of data transmission between data centers. A change in this value can significantly affect the overall system performance by either increasing or decreasing the outbound data transfer rate, leading to variations in execution time and potentially affecting the system's overall latency and throughput."
