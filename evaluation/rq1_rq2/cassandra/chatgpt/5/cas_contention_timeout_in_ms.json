    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option cas_contention_timeout_in_ms in the Cassandra software project is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the timeout duration for contention resolution in the system. A change in this value can significantly affect the overall system performance by either increasing or decreasing the time taken for contention resolution, which can lead to variations in execution time and potentially impact system throughput and response times."
