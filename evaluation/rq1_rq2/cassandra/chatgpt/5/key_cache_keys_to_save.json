    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'key_cache_keys_to_save' in the Cassandra software project is performance-sensitive because changing the value of this configuration can significantly impact system performance. This configuration determines the number of keys to save in the key cache, which directly affects the efficiency of key lookups and overall read performance. A higher value may lead to increased memory consumption and slower read operations, while a lower value may result in more frequent cache misses and slower performance. Therefore, any changes to this configuration can have a noticeable impact on the system's overall performance."
