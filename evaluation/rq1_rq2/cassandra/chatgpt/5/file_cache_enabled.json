    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'file_cache_enabled' configuration in the Cassandra project is performance-sensitive because enabling or disabling file caching can have a significant impact on system performance. When file caching is enabled, it can reduce the number of disk reads and improve read performance by keeping frequently accessed data in memory. On the other hand, if file caching is disabled, it may lead to increased disk I/O operations and slower read performance, ultimately affecting the overall system performance."
