    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'snapshot_links_per_second' in the Cassandra software project is performance-sensitive because changing its value can significantly impact system performance. This configuration determines the rate at which snapshot links are created, which can affect the overall system's execution time and memory consumption. A higher value may lead to increased resource usage and slower performance, while a lower value may improve system efficiency but reduce data protection capabilities."
