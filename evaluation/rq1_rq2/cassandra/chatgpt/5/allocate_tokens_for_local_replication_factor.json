    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'allocate_tokens_for_local_replication_factor' in the Cassandra software project is performance-sensitive. Changing the value of this configuration can significantly impact the distribution of data across nodes, affecting the workload balance and potentially leading to variations in execution time and memory consumption. As the replication factor determines the number of copies of data stored in the cluster, any changes to this configuration can have a direct impact on system performance."
