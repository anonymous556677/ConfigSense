    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The internode_compression configuration option in the Cassandra software project is performance-sensitive because changing its value can significantly impact system performance. Enabling compression can reduce network bandwidth usage and improve overall system throughput, but it can also increase CPU usage and potentially introduce latency due to the compression and decompression overhead. Therefore, the value change of internode_compression can cause notable variations in execution time and resource consumption, making it a performance-sensitive configuration."
