    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'read_request_timeout_in_ms' in the Cassandra software project is performance-sensitive because changing its value can significantly impact the response time of read requests. A lower timeout value may lead to faster response times but could also increase the likelihood of timeouts and retries, impacting overall system performance. On the other hand, a higher timeout value may result in slower response times and potentially increased resource consumption, affecting system performance as well."
