    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'index_summary_resize_interval_in_minutes' in the 'cassandra' software project is performance-sensitive because changing its value can significantly impact the system's performance. This configuration determines how frequently the index summary is resized, which can affect the efficiency of index lookups and overall system performance. A smaller interval may lead to more frequent resizing operations, potentially increasing memory consumption and execution time, while a larger interval may result in outdated or inefficient index summaries, impacting query performance. Therefore, any change in this configuration can have a noticeable impact on system performance."
