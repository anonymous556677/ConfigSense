    "Reason": "The configuration option 'internode_application_receive_queue_capacity_in_bytes' in the 'cassandra' software project is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the capacity for receiving application data between nodes. A change in this value can significantly affect the system's ability to handle incoming data efficiently, leading to potential bottlenecks in data transmission and impacting overall system performance."
