    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'stream_entire_sstables' configuration option in the Cassandra software project is performance-sensitive because changing its value can significantly impact system performance. When set to true, it requires streaming the entire SSTables, which can lead to increased execution time and memory consumption. This can cause notable variations in system performance, making it a performance-sensitive configuration."
