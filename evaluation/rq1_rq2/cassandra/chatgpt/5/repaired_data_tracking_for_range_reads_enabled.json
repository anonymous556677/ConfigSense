    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'repaired_data_tracking_for_range_reads_enabled' in the 'cassandra' software project is performance-sensitive because enabling this option can significantly impact system performance. When enabled, the system will track repaired data for range reads, which can increase memory consumption and potentially lead to longer execution times for range read operations. This additional tracking overhead can have a notable impact on overall system performance, making it a performance-sensitive configuration."
