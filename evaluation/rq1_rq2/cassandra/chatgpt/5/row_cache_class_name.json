    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'row_cache_class_name' configuration in the Cassandra software project is performance-sensitive because changing its value can significantly impact system performance. The row cache class determines the implementation of the row cache, which directly affects the caching mechanism and memory consumption of the system. A change in this configuration can lead to notable variations in execution time and memory usage, making it a critical factor in system performance."
