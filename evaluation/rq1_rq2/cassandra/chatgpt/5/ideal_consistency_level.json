    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The ideal_consistency_level configuration in the Cassandra software project is performance-sensitive because changing this value can have a significant impact on system performance. Consistency levels determine how data consistency is maintained in a distributed system like Cassandra, and setting the ideal consistency level too high can result in increased latency and resource consumption, while setting it too low can lead to data inconsistency and potential performance bottlenecks. Therefore, any change in the ideal_consistency_level configuration can cause notable variations in execution time and memory consumption, making it a performance-sensitive configuration."
