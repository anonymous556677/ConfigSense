    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'native_transport_allow_older_protocols' configuration in the Cassandra software project is performance-sensitive because changing this option can significantly impact system performance. Allowing older protocols may introduce compatibility issues and security vulnerabilities, leading to increased processing overhead and potential performance degradation. Therefore, any change in this configuration can cause notable variations in execution time and memory consumption, making it a performance-sensitive parameter."
