    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The internode_tcp_connect_timeout_in_ms configuration in the Cassandra software project is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the communication between nodes in a distributed system. A change in this configuration can lead to delays in establishing connections between nodes, affecting overall system performance by increasing latency and potentially causing timeouts. Therefore, any significant variation in the value of this configuration can have a noticeable impact on the system's performance."
