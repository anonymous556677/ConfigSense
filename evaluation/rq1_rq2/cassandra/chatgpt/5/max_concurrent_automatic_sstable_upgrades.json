    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'max_concurrent_automatic_sstable_upgrades' in the Cassandra software project is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the system's ability to handle automatic sstable upgrades concurrently. A higher value for this configuration may lead to increased resource utilization, such as CPU and memory, which can affect system performance by causing delays in data processing and potentially leading to performance bottlenecks."
