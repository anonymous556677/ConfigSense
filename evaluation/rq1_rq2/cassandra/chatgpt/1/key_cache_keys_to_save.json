    "Reason": "The key_cache_keys_to_save configuration in the Cassandra software project is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the caching mechanism of keys in memory. Changing the value of this configuration can significantly affect the efficiency of key lookups and overall system performance, leading to variations in execution time and memory consumption."
