    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'num_tokens' configuration in the Cassandra software project determines the number of tokens per node in the token ring. Changing this value can significantly impact the distribution of data across the cluster, affecting performance in terms of data distribution, load balancing, and query routing. A higher number of tokens can lead to more even data distribution but may also increase the overhead for managing the token ring, potentially impacting system performance. Therefore, the 'num_tokens' configuration is considered performance-sensitive."
