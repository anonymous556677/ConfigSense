    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'internode_application_send_queue_reserve_endpoint_capacity_in_bytes' in the 'cassandra' software project is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the capacity allocated for sending queue reserves between nodes. A change in this value can significantly affect the communication and data transfer efficiency between nodes, leading to variations in system performance, such as increased latency or reduced throughput."
