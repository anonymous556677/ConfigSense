    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'corrupted_tombstone_strategy' in the Cassandra software project is performance-sensitive because changing its value can significantly impact system performance. This configuration determines how Cassandra handles corrupted tombstones, which are markers for deleted data. Depending on the strategy chosen, the system may experience variations in execution time and memory consumption, especially when dealing with a large number of tombstones. Therefore, any change in this configuration can have a notable effect on overall system performance."
