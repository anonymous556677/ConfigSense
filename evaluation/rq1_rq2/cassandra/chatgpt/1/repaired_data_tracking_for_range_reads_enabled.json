    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'repaired_data_tracking_for_range_reads_enabled' in the 'cassandra' software project is performance-sensitive because enabling this option can significantly impact system performance. When enabled, the system will track repaired data for range reads, which can increase memory consumption and potentially slow down execution time, especially when dealing with large data sets. Therefore, changing the value of this configuration can lead to notable variations in system performance."
