    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'index_summary_resize_interval_in_minutes' in the 'cassandra' software project is performance-sensitive because changing its value can significantly impact the system's performance. This configuration determines how often the index summary is resized, which can affect the efficiency of index lookups and overall query performance. A smaller interval may lead to more frequent resizing operations, potentially increasing CPU and memory usage, while a larger interval may result in outdated index summaries and slower query performance."
