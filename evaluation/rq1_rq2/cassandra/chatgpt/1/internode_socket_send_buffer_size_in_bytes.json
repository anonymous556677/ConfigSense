    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'internode_socket_send_buffer_size_in_bytes' in the Cassandra software project is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the network communication between nodes. Changing the value of this configuration can significantly affect the efficiency of data transfer and synchronization among nodes, leading to variations in system performance, especially in terms of latency and throughput."
