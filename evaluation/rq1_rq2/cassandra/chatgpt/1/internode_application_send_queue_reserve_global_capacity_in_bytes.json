    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'internode_application_send_queue_reserve_global_capacity_in_bytes' in the 'cassandra' software project is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the global capacity allocated for sending queue reserves between nodes. Changes in this value can significantly affect the communication and data transfer efficiency between nodes, leading to variations in execution time and potentially increased memory consumption."
