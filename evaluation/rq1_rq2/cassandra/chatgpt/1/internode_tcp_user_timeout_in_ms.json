    "Reason": "The internode_tcp_user_timeout_in_ms configuration in the Cassandra software project is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the communication between nodes in a distributed system. A change in this configuration can lead to delays in data transmission, increased network latency, and potential timeouts, all of which can significantly affect system performance and overall throughput."
