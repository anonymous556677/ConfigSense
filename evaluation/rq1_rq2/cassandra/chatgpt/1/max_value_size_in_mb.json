    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'max_value_size_in_mb' in the 'cassandra' software project is performance-sensitive because changing its value can significantly impact system performance. Increasing the max value size can lead to increased memory consumption and potentially slower execution times, especially when dealing with large values. On the other hand, decreasing the max value size can improve performance by reducing memory usage and speeding up operations that involve smaller values."
