    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'diagnostic_events_enabled' configuration option in the Cassandra software project is performance-sensitive. Enabling diagnostic events can significantly impact system performance by increasing execution time and memory consumption. When diagnostic events are enabled, the system needs to collect and process additional data, which can lead to noticeable variations in performance metrics. Therefore, changes to the 'diagnostic_events_enabled' configuration can have a significant impact on system performance."
