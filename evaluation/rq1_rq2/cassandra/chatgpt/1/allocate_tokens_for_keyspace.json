    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'allocate_tokens_for_keyspace' configuration in the Cassandra software project is performance-sensitive because changing its value can significantly impact the distribution of data across the cluster, affecting the load balancing and overall performance of the system. If the tokens are not allocated efficiently, it can lead to uneven data distribution, increased latency, and potential bottlenecks in the system."
