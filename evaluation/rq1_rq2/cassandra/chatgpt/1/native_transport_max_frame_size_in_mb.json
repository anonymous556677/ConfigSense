    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'native_transport_max_frame_size_in_mb' in the Cassandra project is performance-sensitive because changing its value can significantly impact the system's network performance. This configuration determines the maximum frame size for native transport, and increasing it can lead to higher memory consumption and potential network congestion, affecting overall system performance."
