    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'auto_snapshot' configuration in the Cassandra software project is performance-sensitive because enabling automatic snapshots can significantly impact system performance. When auto_snapshot is enabled, the system will take regular snapshots of data, which can increase disk I/O operations and consume additional storage space. This can lead to variations in execution time and memory consumption, especially in high-traffic or resource-constrained environments."
