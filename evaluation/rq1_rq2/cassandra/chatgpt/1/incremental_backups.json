    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'incremental_backups' configuration option in the Cassandra software project is performance-sensitive because enabling incremental backups can significantly impact system performance. Incremental backups involve capturing only the changes made since the last backup, which can consume additional system resources such as CPU and disk I/O. This can lead to variations in execution time and memory consumption, making it a critical configuration option to consider for performance optimization."
