    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'tracetype_query_ttl' in the software project 'cassandra' is performance-sensitive because changing its value can significantly impact the system's performance. This configuration controls the time-to-live (TTL) for tracing data related to query types, and adjusting it can affect the amount of memory consumed for storing tracing information and the overhead of tracing operations, leading to notable variations in system performance."
