    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'file_cache_size_in_mb' configuration in the Cassandra software project is performance-sensitive because changing its value can significantly impact system performance. This configuration determines the size of the file cache used for storing frequently accessed data, and increasing or decreasing this size can lead to notable variations in execution time and memory consumption. A larger file cache size may improve read performance but could also increase memory usage, while a smaller file cache size may lead to more frequent disk reads and slower performance."
