    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The enable_materialized_views configuration option in the Cassandra software project is performance-sensitive because enabling materialized views can significantly impact system performance. Materialized views consume additional resources such as memory and CPU during their creation and maintenance processes. This can lead to increased execution time and memory consumption, especially in scenarios where there are frequent updates to the base tables that the materialized views depend on. Therefore, changing the value of enable_materialized_views can have a notable effect on system performance."
