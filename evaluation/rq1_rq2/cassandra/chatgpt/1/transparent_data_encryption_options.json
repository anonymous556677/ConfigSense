    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The transparent_data_encryption_options configuration in the Cassandra software project is performance-sensitive because enabling or changing the encryption options can significantly impact system performance. Encrypting data can increase CPU usage and memory consumption, leading to slower execution times and potentially affecting overall system performance. Therefore, any changes to this configuration should be carefully evaluated to ensure optimal performance."
