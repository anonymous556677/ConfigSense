    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'enable_scripted_user_defined_functions' in the 'cassandra' software project is performance-sensitive because enabling or disabling scripted user-defined functions can significantly impact the execution time and memory consumption of the system. When enabled, the system may experience increased overhead due to the execution of user-defined functions, leading to potential performance bottlenecks. Therefore, changes to this configuration can have notable variations in system performance."
