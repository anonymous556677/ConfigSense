    "Reason": "The configuration option 'native_transport_max_concurrent_connections_per_ip' in the Cassandra software project is performance-sensitive because changing its value can directly impact the system's ability to handle concurrent connections per IP address. This can lead to significant variations in network throughput and response times, affecting overall system performance."
