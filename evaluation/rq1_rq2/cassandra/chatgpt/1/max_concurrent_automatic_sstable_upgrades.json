    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'max_concurrent_automatic_sstable_upgrades' in the Cassandra project is performance-sensitive because changing its value can significantly impact system performance. This configuration determines the maximum number of automatic sstable upgrades that can occur concurrently, affecting the system's ability to efficiently manage and upgrade sstables. A higher value may lead to increased resource consumption and potential performance degradation, while a lower value may limit the system's ability to optimize sstable upgrades, impacting overall performance."
