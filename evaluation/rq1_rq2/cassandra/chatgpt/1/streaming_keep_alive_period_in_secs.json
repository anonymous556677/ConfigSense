    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'streaming_keep_alive_period_in_secs' configuration in the Cassandra software project is performance-sensitive because changing its value can significantly impact the system's performance. This configuration determines the period in seconds after which a keep-alive message is sent during streaming operations. A lower value can increase the frequency of keep-alive messages, potentially increasing network overhead and affecting overall performance. Conversely, a higher value may lead to longer intervals between keep-alive messages, which could impact the system's responsiveness and efficiency in handling streaming data."
