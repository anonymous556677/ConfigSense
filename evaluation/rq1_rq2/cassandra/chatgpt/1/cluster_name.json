    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'cluster_name' configuration option in the Cassandra software project is performance-sensitive because changing the cluster name can impact the distribution of data across nodes in the cluster, potentially affecting data replication, load balancing, and overall system performance. A different cluster name may lead to changes in data locality, network traffic patterns, and communication overhead, all of which can significantly impact system performance."
