    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'counter_cache_size_in_mb' in the Cassandra software project is performance-sensitive because changing its value can have a significant impact on system performance. Increasing the counter cache size can improve read performance by reducing the number of disk reads for frequently accessed data, while decreasing the size can lead to increased disk reads and slower performance. Therefore, the value change of this configuration can cause notable variations in execution time and memory consumption."
