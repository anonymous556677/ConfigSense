    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'internode_streaming_tcp_user_timeout_in_ms' in the 'cassandra' software project is performance-sensitive because changing its value can significantly impact the communication and data transfer between nodes in the cluster. A lower timeout value may lead to faster detection of unresponsive nodes but can also increase the likelihood of false positives, while a higher timeout value may result in delayed detection of node failures and potential performance bottlenecks in the system."
