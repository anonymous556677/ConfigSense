    "Reason": "The configuration option 'native_transport_flush_in_batches_legacy' in the Cassandra software project is performance-sensitive because changing its value can significantly impact system performance. This configuration controls how data is flushed to disk during network transport, and altering it can lead to notable variations in execution time and memory consumption, affecting overall system performance."
