    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'windows_timer_interval' configuration in the Cassandra software project is performance-sensitive because changing its value can significantly impact system performance. This configuration determines the interval at which Windows timers are triggered, affecting how frequently certain system tasks are executed. A smaller interval may lead to more frequent timer triggers, potentially increasing CPU usage and affecting overall system performance. Conversely, a larger interval may result in delayed timer triggers, impacting the responsiveness and efficiency of the system. Therefore, any changes to the 'windows_timer_interval' configuration can have notable variations in execution time and resource consumption, making it a performance-sensitive parameter."
