    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'internode_application_send_queue_capacity_in_bytes' in the 'cassandra' software project is performance-sensitive because changing its value can significantly impact the system's performance. This configuration determines the capacity of the send queue for inter-node communication, and a low value may lead to increased latency and potential message loss, while a high value may consume excessive memory and degrade overall system performance."
