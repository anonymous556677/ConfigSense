    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'concurrent_counter_writes' in the 'cassandra' software project is performance-sensitive because changing its value can significantly impact system performance. This configuration controls the number of concurrent writes to counter tables, and increasing this value can lead to higher write throughput but also increased memory consumption and potential contention issues. Therefore, changes to this configuration can cause notable variations in execution time and memory consumption, making it performance-sensitive."
