    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'file_cache_enabled' configuration in the Cassandra software project is performance-sensitive because enabling or disabling file caching can have a significant impact on system performance. File caching affects how data is stored and retrieved, which can directly impact execution time and memory consumption. Enabling file caching can improve read performance by reducing disk I/O operations, while disabling it may increase memory usage but reduce read latency. Therefore, changes to this configuration can lead to notable variations in system performance."
