    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option cdc_total_space_in_mb in the Cassandra software project is performance-sensitive because changing its value can significantly impact system performance. This configuration determines the total space available for change data capture (CDC) in megabytes, and a higher value can lead to increased memory consumption and potentially slower performance due to the larger amount of data being captured and stored."
