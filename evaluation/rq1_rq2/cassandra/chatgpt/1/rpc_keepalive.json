    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The rpc_keepalive configuration in the Cassandra software project is performance-sensitive because changing its value can significantly impact the communication overhead between nodes in the cluster. A lower keepalive value may result in more frequent checks and potentially higher network traffic, while a higher keepalive value may lead to longer response times and potential timeouts, affecting overall system performance."
