    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The enable_sasi_indexes configuration in the Cassandra project is performance-sensitive because enabling or disabling secondary indexes can have a significant impact on query performance. When secondary indexes are enabled, additional overhead is introduced for indexing and maintaining the indexes, which can result in increased execution time and memory consumption for queries that utilize these indexes. Therefore, changes to the enable_sasi_indexes configuration can lead to notable variations in system performance."
