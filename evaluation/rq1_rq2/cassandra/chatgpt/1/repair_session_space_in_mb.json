    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'repair_session_space_in_mb' configuration option in the Cassandra software project is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the amount of memory allocated for repair sessions. A higher value for this configuration can lead to increased memory consumption during repair operations, potentially causing memory pressure and affecting overall system performance. Conversely, a lower value may result in insufficient memory allocation, leading to slower repair sessions and impacting system performance as well. Therefore, changes in the 'repair_session_space_in_mb' configuration can significantly affect system performance, making it performance-sensitive."
