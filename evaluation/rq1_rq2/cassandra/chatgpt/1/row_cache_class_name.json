    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'row_cache_class_name' configuration in the Cassandra software project is performance-sensitive because changing its value can significantly impact system performance. This configuration determines the class name of the row cache implementation, which directly affects how caching is handled in Cassandra. A suboptimal choice of row cache implementation can lead to increased memory consumption, slower read and write operations, and overall degradation in system performance."
