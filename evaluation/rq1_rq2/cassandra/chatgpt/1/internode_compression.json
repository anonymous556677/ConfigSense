    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The internode_compression configuration option in the Cassandra software project is performance-sensitive because enabling compression can significantly impact system performance. Compression can reduce network bandwidth usage but may increase CPU usage, leading to variations in execution time and potentially affecting overall system performance."
