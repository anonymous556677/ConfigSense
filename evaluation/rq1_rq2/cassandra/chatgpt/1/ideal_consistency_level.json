    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The ideal_consistency_level configuration in the Cassandra software project is performance-sensitive because changing this value can have a significant impact on system performance. Consistency level determines how many replicas in a distributed system need to respond to a read or write operation before it is considered successful. A higher consistency level can result in longer execution times and increased memory consumption as more replicas need to be involved in the operation, while a lower consistency level can lead to faster but potentially inconsistent results. Therefore, any change in the ideal_consistency_level configuration can cause notable variations in execution time and memory consumption, making it a performance-sensitive configuration."
