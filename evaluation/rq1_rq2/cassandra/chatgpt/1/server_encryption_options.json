    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'server_encryption_options' configuration in the Cassandra software project is performance-sensitive because changing the encryption options can significantly impact system performance. Encryption/decryption processes can consume additional CPU resources and memory, leading to variations in execution time and memory consumption. Stronger encryption algorithms or higher encryption levels may cause noticeable delays in data processing, especially in high-throughput environments."
