    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The cache_load_timeout_seconds configuration determines the amount of time the system waits for cache loading operations to complete. A lower value may lead to increased cache misses and longer execution times, while a higher value may result in increased memory consumption and potential performance degradation. Therefore, changes to this configuration can significantly impact system performance, making it performance-sensitive."
