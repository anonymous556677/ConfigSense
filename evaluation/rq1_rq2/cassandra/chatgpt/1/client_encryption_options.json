    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The client_encryption_options configuration in the Cassandra software project is performance-sensitive because enabling encryption can significantly impact system performance. Encrypting client communications can introduce overhead in terms of CPU usage and network latency, leading to notable variations in execution time and potentially increased memory consumption. Therefore, changes in the client_encryption_options configuration can have a noticeable impact on system performance."
