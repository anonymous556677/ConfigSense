    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'tombstone_warn_threshold' in the Cassandra software project is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the tombstone warning threshold, which affects the read performance of the system. A lower threshold may result in more tombstones being generated, leading to increased read latency and potentially higher memory consumption. Conversely, a higher threshold may delay the detection of tombstone overload, causing performance degradation due to increased tombstone accumulation."
