    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'counter_cache_keys_to_save' in the Cassandra software project is performance-sensitive because changing its value can have a significant impact on the system's performance. This configuration determines the number of keys to save in the counter cache, which directly affects the memory consumption and read performance of the system. A higher value can lead to increased memory usage and slower read operations, while a lower value can result in more frequent cache misses and slower performance overall."
