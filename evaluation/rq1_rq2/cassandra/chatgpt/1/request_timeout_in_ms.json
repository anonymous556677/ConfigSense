    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'request_timeout_in_ms' in the Cassandra software project is not performance-sensitive because changing its value does not significantly impact system performance. The timeout value for requests may affect the response time for individual requests, but it does not cause notable variations in overall execution time or memory consumption at the system level."
