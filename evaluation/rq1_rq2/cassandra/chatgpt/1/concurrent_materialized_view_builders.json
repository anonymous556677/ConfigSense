    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'concurrent_materialized_view_builders' in the Cassandra software project is performance-sensitive because changing its value can significantly impact system performance. This configuration controls the number of concurrent materialized view builders that can run at the same time, affecting the system's ability to efficiently build and update materialized views. Increasing the number of concurrent builders can lead to higher CPU and memory usage, potentially causing bottlenecks and slowdowns in the system. Therefore, any changes to this configuration should be carefully evaluated to ensure optimal performance."
