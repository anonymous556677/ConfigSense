    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The disk_failure_policy configuration in the Cassandra software project is performance-sensitive because it determines how the system handles disk failures, which can have a significant impact on system performance. For example, if the policy is set to immediate, the system may need to perform more frequent disk checks or data replication, leading to increased execution time and memory consumption. On the other hand, if the policy is set to relaxed, the system may tolerate longer periods of disk failure, potentially affecting data availability and overall system performance."
