    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'internode_application_receive_queue_reserve_endpoint_capacity_in_bytes' in the 'cassandra' software project is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the capacity allocated for receiving data between nodes. A change in this value can significantly affect the system's ability to handle incoming data efficiently, leading to potential bottlenecks, increased latency, or even system crashes if not properly configured."
