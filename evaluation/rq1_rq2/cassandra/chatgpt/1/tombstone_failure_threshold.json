    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'tombstone_failure_threshold' in the Cassandra software project is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the handling of tombstones, which are markers for deleted data in the database. A lower threshold may result in more tombstones being processed, leading to increased read latency and potentially higher memory consumption. Conversely, a higher threshold may delay the removal of tombstones, affecting write performance and storage efficiency. Therefore, changes in the 'tombstone_failure_threshold' value can significantly affect system performance in terms of both execution time and memory usage."
