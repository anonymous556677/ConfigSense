    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The dynamic_snitch_reset_interval_in_ms configuration in the Cassandra project is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the behavior of the dynamic snitch mechanism, which is crucial for load balancing and query routing in the distributed database system. A change in this configuration value can significantly affect the accuracy and efficiency of node selection, potentially leading to variations in query response times and overall system performance."
