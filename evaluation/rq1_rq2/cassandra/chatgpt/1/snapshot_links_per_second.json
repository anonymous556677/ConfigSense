    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'snapshot_links_per_second' in the Cassandra software project is performance-sensitive because changing its value can significantly impact system performance. This configuration determines the rate at which snapshot links are created, which can directly affect the system's resource usage and overall performance. A higher value may lead to increased memory consumption and longer execution times, while a lower value may result in better performance but fewer snapshot links being created."
