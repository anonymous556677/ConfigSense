    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'max_value_size_in_mb' configuration in the Cassandra software project is performance-sensitive because changing its value can directly impact the amount of memory consumed by the system. Increasing the max value size can lead to increased memory usage, potentially causing memory pressure and affecting overall system performance. Similarly, decreasing the max value size can improve memory efficiency but may also impact performance depending on the workload and data size."
