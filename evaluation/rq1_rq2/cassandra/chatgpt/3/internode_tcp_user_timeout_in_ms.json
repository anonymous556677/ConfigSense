    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The internode_tcp_user_timeout_in_ms configuration in the Cassandra software project is performance-sensitive because changing its value can significantly impact the communication between nodes in the cluster. A lower timeout value may lead to quicker detection of unresponsive nodes but could also result in increased network overhead and potential performance degradation. On the other hand, a higher timeout value may improve network stability but could also introduce delays in detecting node failures, impacting system performance. Therefore, any change in this configuration can have notable variations in system performance, making it a performance-sensitive parameter."
