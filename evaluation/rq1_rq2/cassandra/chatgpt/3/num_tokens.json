    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'num_tokens' configuration in the Cassandra software project is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the partitioning of data across the cluster. Changing the value of 'num_tokens' can significantly affect the distribution of data and the efficiency of data retrieval operations, leading to notable variations in system performance such as increased latency or decreased throughput."
