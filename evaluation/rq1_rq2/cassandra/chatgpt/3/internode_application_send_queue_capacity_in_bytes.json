    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'internode_application_send_queue_capacity_in_bytes' in the 'cassandra' software project is performance-sensitive because changing its value can significantly impact the system's network communication efficiency. A higher value may lead to increased memory consumption and potential network congestion, affecting overall system performance. Conversely, a lower value may result in decreased throughput and slower data transmission, impacting system responsiveness and latency."
