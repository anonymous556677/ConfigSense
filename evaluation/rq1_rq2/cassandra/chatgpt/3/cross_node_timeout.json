    "Reason": "The configuration option 'cross_node_timeout' in the Cassandra software project is performance-sensitive because changing its value can significantly impact the communication and coordination between nodes in a distributed system. A longer timeout may lead to increased latency and potential timeouts, while a shorter timeout may result in more frequent retries and increased network traffic, both of which can affect system performance."
