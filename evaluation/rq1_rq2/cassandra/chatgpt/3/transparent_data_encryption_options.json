    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'transparent_data_encryption_options' configuration in the Cassandra software project is performance-sensitive because enabling transparent data encryption can significantly impact system performance. Encrypting and decrypting data on the fly can increase CPU usage, memory consumption, and overall execution time, leading to notable variations in system performance."
