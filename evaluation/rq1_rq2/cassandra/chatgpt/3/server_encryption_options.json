    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The server_encryption_options configuration in the Cassandra software project is performance-sensitive because changing the encryption options can significantly impact system performance. For example, enabling strong encryption algorithms may increase CPU usage and latency, while disabling encryption may reduce overhead but compromise data security. Therefore, any modification to the server_encryption_options can lead to notable variations in execution time and resource consumption, making it a performance-sensitive configuration."
