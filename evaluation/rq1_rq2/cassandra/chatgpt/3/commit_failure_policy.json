    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The commit_failure_policy configuration in the Cassandra software project is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the system's behavior in handling commit failures. A change in this configuration can lead to significant variations in system performance, especially in terms of data consistency and reliability. For example, a more aggressive commit failure policy may result in increased latency due to more frequent retries, while a more lenient policy may compromise data integrity. Therefore, any adjustments to this configuration should be carefully evaluated to ensure optimal system performance."
