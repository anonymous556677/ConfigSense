    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'key_cache_keys_to_save' configuration in the Cassandra software project is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the efficiency of key caching, which can significantly affect read/write operations and overall system performance. Changing the value of this configuration can lead to notable variations in data retrieval speed and memory usage, making it a critical factor in optimizing system performance."
