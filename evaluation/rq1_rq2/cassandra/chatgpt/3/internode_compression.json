    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The internode_compression configuration option in the Cassandra software project is performance-sensitive because enabling or disabling compression can have a significant impact on system performance. Compression can reduce the amount of data transferred between nodes, leading to lower network bandwidth usage and potentially faster data transmission. However, compression also requires additional CPU resources for encoding and decoding data, which can increase CPU usage and potentially impact overall system performance, especially in high-traffic scenarios."
