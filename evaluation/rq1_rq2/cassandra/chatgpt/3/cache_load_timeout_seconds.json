    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'cache_load_timeout_seconds' in the 'cassandra' software project is performance-sensitive because changing its value can significantly impact system performance. A lower value may result in faster cache loading times but could also lead to increased CPU usage and potential resource contention, while a higher value may reduce CPU usage but could cause longer cache loading times and potentially impact overall system responsiveness."
