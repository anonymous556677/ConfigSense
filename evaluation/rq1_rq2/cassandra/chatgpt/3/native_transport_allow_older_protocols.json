    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'native_transport_allow_older_protocols' configuration option in the Cassandra software project is performance-sensitive because changing this value can significantly impact system performance. Allowing older protocols may introduce compatibility issues and security vulnerabilities, leading to increased processing time and memory consumption. Additionally, older protocols may not be optimized for performance, resulting in slower data transmission and potential bottlenecks in the system."
