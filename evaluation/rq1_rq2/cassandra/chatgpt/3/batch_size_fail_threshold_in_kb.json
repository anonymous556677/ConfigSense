    "Reason": "The configuration option batch_size_fail_threshold_in_kb in the Cassandra software project is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the memory consumption of the system. A change in this value can significantly affect the system's performance by causing variations in memory usage, potentially leading to performance degradation or failures during batch processing operations."
