    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'sstable_preemptive_open_interval_in_mb' in the Cassandra project is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the interval at which SSTables are preemptively opened during compaction. A change in this value can significantly affect the overall performance of the system by influencing the frequency and efficiency of compaction processes, which in turn can impact execution time and memory consumption. Therefore, any notable variations in the value of this configuration can have a noticeable impact on system performance."
