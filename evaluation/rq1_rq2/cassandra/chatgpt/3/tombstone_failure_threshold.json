    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'tombstone_failure_threshold' in the Cassandra software project is performance-sensitive because it determines the threshold for tombstone failure, which can significantly impact read and write operations in the database. A lower threshold may result in more tombstones being created, leading to increased read latency and potentially higher memory consumption. On the other hand, a higher threshold may delay tombstone removal, affecting write performance and potentially causing increased disk space usage. Therefore, changes in the value of this configuration can have notable variations in system performance."
