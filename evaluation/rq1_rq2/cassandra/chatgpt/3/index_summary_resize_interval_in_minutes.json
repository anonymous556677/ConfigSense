    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'index_summary_resize_interval_in_minutes' in the 'cassandra' software project is performance-sensitive because changing its value can significantly impact the system's performance. This configuration determines how frequently the index summaries are resized, which can affect the efficiency of index lookups and overall query performance. A smaller interval may lead to more frequent resizing operations, potentially increasing memory consumption and affecting query response times. On the other hand, a larger interval may delay resizing operations, impacting query performance in a different way. Therefore, any change in this configuration can have notable variations in execution time and memory consumption, making it performance-sensitive."
