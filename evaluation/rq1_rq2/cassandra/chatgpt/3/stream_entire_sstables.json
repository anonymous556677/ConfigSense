    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'stream_entire_sstables' configuration option in the Cassandra project is performance-sensitive because changing its value can significantly impact system performance. When set to true, it can lead to increased memory consumption and longer execution times as the entire SSTables are streamed during operations, causing potential bottlenecks and slowdowns in the system. Therefore, any change in this configuration can have notable variations in system performance."
