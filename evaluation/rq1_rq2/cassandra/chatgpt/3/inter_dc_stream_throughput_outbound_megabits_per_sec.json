    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'inter_dc_stream_throughput_outbound_megabits_per_sec' in the 'cassandra' software project is performance-sensitive because changing its value can significantly impact the throughput of data transfer between data centers. This can directly affect the overall system performance by causing delays in data replication and synchronization, leading to potential bottlenecks and degraded performance."
