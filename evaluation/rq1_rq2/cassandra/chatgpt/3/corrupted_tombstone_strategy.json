    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'corrupted_tombstone_strategy' in the Cassandra software project is performance-sensitive because changing its value can significantly impact system performance. This configuration determines how the system handles corrupted tombstones, which are markers for deleted data. Depending on the strategy chosen, the system may need to perform additional processing or consume more memory, leading to variations in execution time and memory consumption."
