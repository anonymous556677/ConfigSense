    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'range_request_timeout_in_ms' in the Cassandra software project is performance-sensitive because changing its value can significantly impact the system's performance. This configuration determines the timeout for range requests, which can affect the overall response time and throughput of the system. A lower timeout value may lead to increased request failures and retransmissions, impacting performance, while a higher timeout value may increase latency and resource consumption. Therefore, any change in this configuration can have notable variations in execution time and system performance."
