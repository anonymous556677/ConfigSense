    "Reason": "The initial_token configuration in the Cassandra software project is performance-sensitive because it determines the initial token for a node in the Cassandra cluster, which affects the distribution of data across the cluster. Changing the initial_token value can lead to significant variations in data distribution, potentially impacting system performance in terms of data retrieval and storage operations."
