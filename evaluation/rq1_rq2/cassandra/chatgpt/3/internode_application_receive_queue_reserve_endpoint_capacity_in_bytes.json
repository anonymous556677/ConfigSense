    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option internode_application_receive_queue_reserve_endpoint_capacity_in_bytes in the Cassandra software project is performance-sensitive. This configuration directly impacts the capacity allocated for receiving messages between nodes in the cluster. Changing this value can significantly affect the system's ability to handle incoming messages efficiently, leading to potential bottlenecks and increased latency in communication between nodes. Therefore, any notable variations in this configuration can have a noticeable impact on overall system performance."
