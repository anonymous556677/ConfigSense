    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'file_cache_enabled' configuration in the Cassandra software project is performance-sensitive because enabling or disabling file caching can have a significant impact on system performance. When file caching is enabled, it can improve read performance by storing frequently accessed data in memory, reducing the need to fetch data from disk. However, this can also increase memory consumption and potentially lead to cache thrashing if not properly managed. On the other hand, disabling file caching can result in slower read performance but may reduce memory usage. Therefore, the value change of 'file_cache_enabled' can cause notable variations in execution time and memory consumption, making it a performance-sensitive configuration."
