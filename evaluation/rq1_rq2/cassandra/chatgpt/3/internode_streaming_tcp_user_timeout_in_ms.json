    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'internode_streaming_tcp_user_timeout_in_ms' in the 'cassandra' software project is performance-sensitive because changing its value can significantly impact the communication between nodes in the cluster. A lower timeout value may lead to quicker detection of unresponsive nodes but could also result in increased retransmissions and potential performance degradation. On the other hand, a higher timeout value may reduce the likelihood of false positives but could introduce delays in detecting node failures, impacting system responsiveness and overall performance."
