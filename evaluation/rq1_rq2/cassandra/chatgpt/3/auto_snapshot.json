    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'auto_snapshot' configuration in the Cassandra software project is performance-sensitive because enabling or disabling automatic snapshots can have a significant impact on system performance. When auto_snapshot is enabled, the system will take regular snapshots of data, which can increase disk I/O operations and consume additional storage space. This can lead to variations in execution time and memory consumption, especially in scenarios where frequent snapshots are taken. Therefore, changes in the value of auto_snapshot can noticeably affect the overall performance of the system."
