    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The native_transport_idle_timeout_in_ms configuration in the Cassandra project is performance-sensitive because changing its value can significantly impact the system's performance. This configuration determines the amount of time a connection can remain idle before being closed, affecting the overall throughput and resource utilization of the system. A lower value may lead to more frequent connection closures and re-establishments, impacting performance, while a higher value may result in increased resource consumption and potential bottlenecks. Therefore, any changes to this configuration can have notable variations in execution time and memory consumption, making it performance-sensitive."
