    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'row_cache_size_in_mb' configuration in Cassandra is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the amount of memory allocated for caching rows in memory. Changing this value can significantly affect the system's performance by either improving or degrading the read performance depending on the workload and data access patterns. A higher value may lead to increased memory consumption and potential cache hits, while a lower value may result in more disk reads and slower performance."
