    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The audit_logging_options configuration in the Cassandra software project is performance-sensitive because enabling audit logging can significantly impact system performance. When audit logging is enabled, additional operations are performed to log and store audit information, which can increase execution time and memory consumption. This additional overhead can cause notable variations in system performance, making this configuration performance-sensitive."
