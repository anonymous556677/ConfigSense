    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The enable_sasi_indexes configuration in the Cassandra software project is performance-sensitive because enabling SASI indexes can significantly impact system performance. SASI indexes can consume additional memory and CPU resources, leading to increased query execution times and potentially affecting overall system throughput. Therefore, changes to the enable_sasi_indexes configuration can have a notable impact on system performance."
