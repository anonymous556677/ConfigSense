    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'streaming_keep_alive_period_in_secs' configuration in the Cassandra software project is performance-sensitive because changing its value can significantly impact the system's performance. This configuration determines the period in seconds between keep-alive messages sent during streaming operations, affecting the efficiency of data transfer and resource utilization. A lower value may increase network traffic and resource consumption, while a higher value may introduce latency and potential bottlenecks in data streaming processes."
