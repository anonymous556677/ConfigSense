    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The rpc_keepalive configuration in the Cassandra software project is performance-sensitive because changing its value can significantly impact system performance. This configuration determines the interval at which the server sends keep-alive messages to clients to maintain the connection. A lower value can increase network traffic and resource consumption, while a higher value can lead to longer response times and potential connection timeouts. Therefore, any change in the rpc_keepalive setting can have noticeable effects on the overall performance of the system."
