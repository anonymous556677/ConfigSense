    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'repaired_data_tracking_for_range_reads_enabled' in the 'cassandra' software project is performance-sensitive because enabling this option can significantly impact system performance. When this option is enabled, the system needs to track repaired data for range reads, which can increase memory consumption and potentially lead to longer execution times for range read operations. Therefore, changing the value of this configuration option can have a notable effect on overall system performance."
