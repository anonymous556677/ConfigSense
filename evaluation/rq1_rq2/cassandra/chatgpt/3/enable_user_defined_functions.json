    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The enable_user_defined_functions configuration option in the Cassandra software project allows users to define custom functions in CQL queries. Enabling user-defined functions can significantly impact system performance as it introduces additional processing overhead for parsing and executing these custom functions. Depending on the complexity and efficiency of the user-defined functions, it can lead to notable variations in execution time and memory consumption, making this configuration performance-sensitive."
