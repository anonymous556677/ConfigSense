    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'file_cache_size_in_mb' configuration in the Cassandra software project is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the amount of memory allocated for file caching. A change in this value can significantly affect system performance by either improving or degrading the overall read and write operations efficiency. A higher value may lead to better read performance but could also increase memory consumption, while a lower value may reduce memory usage but potentially degrade read performance. Therefore, any alteration in this configuration can have notable variations in execution time and memory consumption, making it a performance-sensitive parameter."
