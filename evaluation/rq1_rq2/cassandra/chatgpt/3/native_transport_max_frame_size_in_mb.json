    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'native_transport_max_frame_size_in_mb' in the 'cassandra' software project is performance-sensitive because changing its value can significantly impact the system performance. This configuration determines the maximum frame size for native transport connections, and a higher value can lead to increased memory consumption and potentially slower execution times due to larger data transfers."
