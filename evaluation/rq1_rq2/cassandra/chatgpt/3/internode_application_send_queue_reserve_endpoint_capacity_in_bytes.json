    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'internode_application_send_queue_reserve_endpoint_capacity_in_bytes' in the 'cassandra' software project is performance-sensitive because changing its value can significantly impact the system's network communication performance. This configuration directly affects the amount of memory allocated for sending data between nodes, and a change in this value can lead to variations in network latency and throughput, ultimately impacting overall system performance."
