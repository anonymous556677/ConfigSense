    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'native_transport_max_concurrent_connections_per_ip' in the Cassandra project is performance-sensitive because changing its value can directly impact the system's ability to handle concurrent connections from different IPs. A higher value may lead to increased resource utilization and potential bottlenecks in handling network traffic, while a lower value may limit the system's scalability and throughput. Therefore, any significant change in this configuration can result in notable variations in system performance, making it a performance-sensitive parameter."
