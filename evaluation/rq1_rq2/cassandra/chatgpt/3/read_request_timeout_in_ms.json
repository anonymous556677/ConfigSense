    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'read_request_timeout_in_ms' in the Cassandra software project is performance-sensitive. Changing the value of this configuration can significantly impact system performance by affecting the response time of read requests. A lower timeout value may lead to faster response times but could also increase the likelihood of timeouts and retransmissions, impacting overall system performance. On the other hand, a higher timeout value may reduce the chances of timeouts but could result in longer response times, affecting system performance as well."
