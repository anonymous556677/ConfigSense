    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'cluster_name' configuration option in the Cassandra software project is performance-sensitive because changing the cluster name can impact the distribution of data across nodes in the cluster, affecting data access patterns, replication strategies, and overall system performance. A different cluster name may lead to increased network traffic, data transfer latency, and resource utilization, ultimately influencing the system's throughput and response times."
