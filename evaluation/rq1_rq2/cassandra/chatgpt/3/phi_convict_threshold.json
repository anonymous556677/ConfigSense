    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'phi_convict_threshold' in the 'cassandra' software project is performance-sensitive because changing its value can significantly impact the system's performance. This configuration determines the threshold for failure detection in the system, and a lower value can lead to more aggressive failure detection, potentially affecting system stability and performance. Conversely, a higher value may delay failure detection, impacting system responsiveness and overall performance."
