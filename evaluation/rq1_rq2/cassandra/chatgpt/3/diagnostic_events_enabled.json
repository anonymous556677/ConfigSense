    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'diagnostic_events_enabled' configuration option in the Cassandra software project is performance-sensitive. Enabling diagnostic events can significantly impact system performance by increasing overhead in terms of execution time and memory consumption. When diagnostic events are enabled, the system may need to collect and process additional data, leading to potential slowdowns in performance. Therefore, changing the value of this configuration option can have a notable effect on the overall performance of the system."
