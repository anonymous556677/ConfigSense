    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'dynamic_snitch_reset_interval_in_ms' in the Cassandra software project is performance-sensitive because changing its value can significantly impact the dynamic snitch behavior, which in turn affects how nodes are chosen for read and write operations. A lower reset interval may lead to more frequent adjustments in node rankings, potentially causing variations in query response times and overall system performance."
