    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The enable_materialized_views configuration in the Cassandra software project is performance-sensitive because enabling materialized views can significantly impact system performance. Materialized views consume additional memory and can increase the execution time of queries that involve them. Therefore, changing the value of this configuration can lead to notable variations in both memory consumption and query execution time, making it a performance-sensitive configuration."
