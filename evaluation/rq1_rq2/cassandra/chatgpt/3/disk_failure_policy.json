    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The disk_failure_policy configuration in the Cassandra software project is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the system's data durability and fault tolerance mechanisms. Changing this configuration can significantly affect the system's overall performance by influencing how data is replicated and stored, potentially leading to increased disk I/O operations and resource utilization."
