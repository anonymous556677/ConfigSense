    "Reason": "The 'role_manager' configuration in the 'cassandra' software project is performance-sensitive because changing its value can significantly impact the system's performance. The role manager configuration determines how roles are managed within the system, affecting access control, resource allocation, and overall system efficiency. A change in this configuration can lead to variations in execution time and memory consumption, making it a critical factor in system performance."
