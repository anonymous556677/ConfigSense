    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option internode_application_send_queue_reserve_global_capacity_in_bytes in the cassandra software project is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the global capacity reserved for sending application data between nodes. A change in this value can significantly affect the system's network performance, potentially leading to variations in data transmission speed and overall system throughput."
