    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'native_transport_flush_in_batches_legacy' configuration in the Cassandra project is performance-sensitive because changing its value can significantly impact the system's performance. This configuration controls how data is flushed to disk during native transport, and altering it can lead to notable variations in execution time and memory consumption, affecting overall system performance."
