    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'streaming_connections_per_host' in the 'cassandra' software project is performance-sensitive because changing the number of streaming connections per host can directly impact the network bandwidth usage and overall system throughput. Increasing this value can lead to higher network traffic and potential bottlenecks, while decreasing it can result in underutilization of available resources. Therefore, any significant change in this configuration can have a noticeable effect on system performance in terms of data transfer speed and overall system efficiency."
