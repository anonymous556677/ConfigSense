    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'snapshot_links_per_second' in the Cassandra software project is performance-sensitive because changing its value can have a significant impact on system performance. This configuration determines the rate at which snapshot links are created, which can affect the overall execution time and memory consumption of the system. A higher value may lead to increased resource usage and slower performance, while a lower value may improve system efficiency but limit the functionality of creating snapshot links."
