    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'internode_application_receive_queue_reserve_global_capacity_in_bytes' in the 'cassandra' software project is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the global capacity allocated for receiving application data between nodes. Changing this value can significantly affect the system's ability to handle incoming data efficiently, leading to variations in execution time and memory consumption during inter-node communication."
