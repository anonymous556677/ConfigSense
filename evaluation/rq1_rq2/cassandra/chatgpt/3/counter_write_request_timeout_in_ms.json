    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'counter_write_request_timeout_in_ms' in the Cassandra software project is performance-sensitive because changing its value can significantly impact the system's performance. This configuration determines the timeout for write requests to counters, and a lower timeout can lead to increased latency and potential timeouts for write operations, affecting overall system performance."
