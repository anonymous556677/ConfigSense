    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The internode_socket_send_buffer_size_in_bytes configuration in the Cassandra software project is performance-sensitive because changing its value can significantly impact the network communication performance between nodes. A larger buffer size can improve data transfer speed and reduce latency, while a smaller buffer size can lead to increased network congestion and slower data transmission, ultimately affecting system performance."
