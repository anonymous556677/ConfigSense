    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'counter_cache_keys_to_save' in the Cassandra software project is performance-sensitive because changing its value can have a significant impact on system performance. This configuration determines the number of keys to save in the counter cache, which directly affects memory consumption and read performance. A higher value can lead to increased memory usage and slower read operations, while a lower value can result in reduced memory usage but potentially slower read performance. Therefore, any change in the value of this configuration can cause notable variations in execution time and memory consumption, making it performance-sensitive."
