    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The enablePngCrush configuration option is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the image processing performance of the dconverter software. Enabling PngCrush can significantly reduce the size of PNG images, leading to faster loading times and reduced memory consumption. However, disabling PngCrush can result in larger file sizes, slower image processing, and increased memory usage, ultimately affecting the overall system performance."
