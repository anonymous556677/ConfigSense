    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'keepUnoptimizedFilesPostProcessor' configuration option is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the post-processing of unoptimized files in the system. If this option is set to true, it will result in additional processing overhead and potentially increase execution time and memory consumption. On the other hand, if set to false, it can improve system performance by skipping unnecessary post-processing steps. Therefore, any change in the value of this configuration can significantly affect the overall performance of the system."
