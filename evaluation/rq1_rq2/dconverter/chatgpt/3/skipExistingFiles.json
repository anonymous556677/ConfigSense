    "Reason": "The 'skipExistingFiles' configuration option is performance-sensitive because changing its value can significantly impact system performance. When set to true, the system will skip processing existing files, potentially reducing execution time and memory consumption. However, when set to false, the system will process all files, which can lead to increased execution time and memory usage, making it performance-sensitive."
