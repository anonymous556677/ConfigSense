    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'compressionQuality' is performance-sensitive because it directly affects the amount of computational resources required for image compression and decompression processes. Higher compression quality settings typically result in longer execution times and increased memory consumption, while lower quality settings may lead to faster processing but lower image quality. Therefore, changes in the 'compressionQuality' value can significantly impact system performance by affecting both execution time and memory usage."
