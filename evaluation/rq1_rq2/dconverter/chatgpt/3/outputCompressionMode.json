    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The outputCompressionMode configuration can significantly impact system performance. Changing the compression mode can affect the amount of CPU and memory resources required during the conversion process, leading to notable variations in execution time and memory consumption. Therefore, this configuration is considered performance-sensitive."
