    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'scaleMode' configuration option in the 'dconverter' software project is performance-sensitive because changing its value can significantly impact system performance. For example, if the scaleMode is set to a higher value, it may require more computational resources and memory, leading to increased execution time and memory consumption. Conversely, setting it to a lower value may result in faster execution but potentially lower quality output. Therefore, any change in the 'scaleMode' configuration can have notable variations in system performance, making it performance-sensitive."
