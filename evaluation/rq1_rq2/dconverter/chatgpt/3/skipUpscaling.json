    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'skipUpscaling' is performance-sensitive because changing its value significantly affects the system's performance. When set to true, it skips the upscaling process, which can lead to faster execution time and lower memory consumption. However, when set to false, the upscaling process is performed, potentially increasing execution time and memory usage. This can result in notable variations in system performance, making it a performance-sensitive configuration."
