    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'roundingHandler' is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the rounding behavior of the software, which can affect the precision of calculations and potentially lead to variations in execution time and memory consumption. For example, changing the rounding method from round half up to round half down can significantly impact the results of mathematical operations and consequently affect system performance."
