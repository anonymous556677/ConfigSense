{
    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'skipUpscaling' is performance-sensitive because changing its value can significantly impact system performance. When set to true, it skips the upscaling process, which can lead to faster execution time and lower memory consumption. On the other hand, when set to false, the upscaling process is performed, potentially increasing execution time and memory usage. This significant impact on system performance classifies the configuration as performance-sensitive."
