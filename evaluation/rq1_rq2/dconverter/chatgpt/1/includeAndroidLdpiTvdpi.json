    "Reason": "The includeAndroidLdpiTvdpi configuration option is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the memory consumption and rendering performance of the dconverter software project. When this configuration is enabled, the application needs to load additional resources for supporting ldpi and tvdpi screen densities, which can increase memory usage and potentially slow down rendering speed, especially on devices with limited resources."
