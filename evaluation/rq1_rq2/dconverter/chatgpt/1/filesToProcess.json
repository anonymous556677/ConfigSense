    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'filesToProcess' is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the amount of data that needs to be processed by the system. Increasing the value of 'filesToProcess' can lead to a significant increase in execution time and memory consumption as more files are being processed, potentially causing performance degradation. Conversely, decreasing the value can improve system performance by reducing the workload on the system."
