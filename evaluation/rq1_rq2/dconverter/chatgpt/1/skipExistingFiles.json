    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'skipExistingFiles' is performance-sensitive because changing its value can significantly impact system performance. When set to true, the software will skip processing existing files, potentially reducing execution time and memory consumption. However, if set to false, the software will process all files, leading to increased execution time and memory usage. This can cause notable variations in system performance, making it a performance-sensitive configuration."
