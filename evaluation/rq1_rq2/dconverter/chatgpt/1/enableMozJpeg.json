    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The enableMozJpeg configuration option in the dconverter software project is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the image compression and decompression process. Enabling MozJPEG can significantly improve the performance by reducing the file size and processing time of images, while disabling it can lead to increased memory consumption and slower execution times. Therefore, any change in the value of enableMozJpeg can have a notable effect on system performance."
