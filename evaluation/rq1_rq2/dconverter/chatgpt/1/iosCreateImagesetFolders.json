    "Reason": "The configuration option 'iosCreateImagesetFolders' is performance-sensitive because changing its value can significantly impact system performance. This configuration likely involves creating multiple image set folders, which can affect execution time and memory consumption, especially if there are a large number of images involved. Therefore, any changes to this configuration can lead to notable variations in system performance."
