    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'roundingHandler' configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the precision of rounding operations in the system. A change in the roundingHandler value can lead to significant variations in execution time, especially in scenarios where a large number of rounding operations are performed. This can affect the overall system performance and resource consumption, making it a critical configuration to consider for performance optimization."
