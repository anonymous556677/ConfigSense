    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'threadCount' configuration option is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the parallelism and concurrency of the system. Changing the value of 'threadCount' can significantly affect the system's execution time and resource utilization, especially in multi-threaded environments. A higher thread count may lead to increased CPU and memory usage, while a lower thread count may result in slower processing and potential bottlenecks. Therefore, any changes to the 'threadCount' configuration can have a notable impact on system performance."
