    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option createMipMapInsteadOfDrawableDir is performance-sensitive because changing this option can significantly impact system performance. When creating mipmaps instead of using a drawable directory, it can affect the execution time and memory consumption of the application, especially when dealing with large images. This change can lead to noticeable variations in performance, making it a performance-sensitive configuration."
