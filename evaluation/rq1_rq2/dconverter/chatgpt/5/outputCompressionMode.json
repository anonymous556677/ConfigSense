    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The outputCompressionMode configuration is performance-sensitive because changing its value can significantly impact system performance. For example, enabling a high compression mode can increase execution time and memory consumption, while disabling compression can reduce these resources usage. This configuration directly affects how much processing power and memory are required during file conversion, making it crucial for optimizing system performance."
