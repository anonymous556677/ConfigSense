    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'skipUpscaling' configuration option is performance-sensitive because changing its value significantly affects the system's execution time and memory consumption. When set to true, the system skips the upscaling process, leading to faster execution but potentially higher memory usage. On the other hand, when set to false, the system performs upscaling, which may result in longer execution times but lower memory consumption. Therefore, the value of 'skipUpscaling' directly impacts system performance, making it a performance-sensitive configuration."
