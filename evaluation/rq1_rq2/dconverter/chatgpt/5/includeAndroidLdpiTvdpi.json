    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option includeAndroidLdpiTvdpi is performance-sensitive because changing the value of this configuration can significantly impact the memory consumption and rendering performance of the dconverter software project. Different screen densities (ldpi, mdpi, hdpi, xhdpi, xxhdpi, xxxhdpi) require different resources for rendering, and including unnecessary densities can lead to increased memory usage and slower rendering times."
