    "Reason": "The configuration option 'clearDirBeforeConvert' is performance-sensitive because clearing the directory before conversion can significantly impact system performance. If the directory is large and contains many files, clearing it before each conversion process can increase execution time and memory consumption. This extra overhead can cause notable variations in the overall performance of the system."
