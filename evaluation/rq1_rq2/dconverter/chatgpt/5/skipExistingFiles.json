    "Reason": "The configuration option 'skipExistingFiles' is performance-sensitive because changing its value can significantly impact system performance. If set to true, the system may skip existing files during conversion, reducing the processing time and memory consumption. However, if set to false, the system may unnecessarily process existing files, leading to increased execution time and memory usage."
