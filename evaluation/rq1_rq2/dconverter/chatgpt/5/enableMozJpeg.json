    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The enableMozJpeg configuration option is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the image processing performance of the dconverter software. Enabling MozJPEG, a specific JPEG encoding library, can significantly improve image compression and processing speed, leading to notable variations in execution time and memory consumption. Disabling or changing this configuration can result in slower image processing and increased resource usage, making it a critical factor for system performance."
