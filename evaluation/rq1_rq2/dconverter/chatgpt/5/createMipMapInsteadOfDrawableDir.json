    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'createMipMapInsteadOfDrawableDir' is performance-sensitive because changing its value from true to false can significantly impact system performance. When set to true, the system will create mipmaps for images instead of using the drawable directory, which can consume more memory and increase execution time. This can lead to notable variations in memory consumption and execution time, making it a performance-sensitive configuration."
