    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'keepUnoptimizedFilesPostProcessor' is performance-sensitive because changing its value can significantly impact system performance. If set to true, it may result in increased memory consumption and execution time as unoptimized files are retained, leading to potential performance degradation. On the other hand, setting it to false can improve performance by reducing memory usage and speeding up processing, making it a critical configuration for system performance."
