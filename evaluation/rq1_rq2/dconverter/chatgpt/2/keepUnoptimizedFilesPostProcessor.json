    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'keepUnoptimizedFilesPostProcessor' is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the memory consumption and execution time of the system. When set to true, it retains unoptimized files after processing, leading to increased memory usage and potentially longer execution times. On the other hand, when set to false, it can improve system performance by reducing memory overhead and speeding up processing. Therefore, changes in this configuration can significantly affect the overall performance of the system."
