    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The enableAntiAliasing configuration option is performance-sensitive because enabling anti-aliasing can significantly impact system performance by increasing the computational load on the graphics processing unit (GPU) and potentially causing noticeable variations in rendering time and memory consumption. Anti-aliasing involves smoothing out jagged edges in graphics, which requires additional processing power and memory resources. Therefore, changing the value of this configuration can have a notable effect on the overall performance of the dconverter software project."
