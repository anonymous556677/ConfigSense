    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'scaleMode' configuration option is performance-sensitive because changing its value significantly affects the system's performance. For example, setting 'scaleMode' to a higher value may increase the processing time and memory consumption of the 'dconverter' software project, while setting it to a lower value may improve performance. Therefore, the 'scaleMode' configuration option has a notable impact on system performance and is considered performance-sensitive."
