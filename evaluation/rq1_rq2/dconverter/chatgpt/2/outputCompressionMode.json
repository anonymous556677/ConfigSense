    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The outputCompressionMode configuration option is performance-sensitive because changing its value can significantly impact system performance. For example, if the compression mode is set to a higher level, it may increase the execution time and memory consumption of the system due to the increased processing required for compression. On the other hand, setting it to a lower level may reduce the execution time and memory consumption but may compromise the quality of the output. Therefore, any change in the outputCompressionMode configuration can have a notable effect on system performance."
