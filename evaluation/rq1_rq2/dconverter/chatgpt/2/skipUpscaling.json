    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'skipUpscaling' is performance-sensitive because changing its value significantly affects system performance. When set to true, it skips the upscaling process, which can lead to reduced execution time and memory consumption. On the other hand, setting it to false triggers upscaling, potentially increasing execution time and memory usage. This variation in behavior directly impacts system performance, making it a performance-sensitive configuration."
