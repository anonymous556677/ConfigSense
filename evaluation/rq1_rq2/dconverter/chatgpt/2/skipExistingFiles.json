    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'skipExistingFiles' is performance-sensitive because changing its value can significantly impact system performance. When set to true, the software project 'dconverter' may skip processing existing files, leading to faster execution time and lower memory consumption. However, when set to false, the software may unnecessarily process existing files, resulting in longer execution time and higher memory consumption. This can cause notable variations in system performance, making it a performance-sensitive configuration."
