    "Reason": "The 'threadCount' configuration option in the 'dconverter' software project is performance-sensitive because changing the number of threads can significantly impact system performance. Increasing the thread count can lead to better parallel processing and faster execution times, while decreasing the thread count may result in slower performance due to reduced concurrency and resource utilization."
