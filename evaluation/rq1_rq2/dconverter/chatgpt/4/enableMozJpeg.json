    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The enableMozJpeg configuration option in the dconverter software project is performance-sensitive because enabling or disabling it significantly affects the image processing performance. When enabled, it uses the MozJPEG library for image compression, which can result in faster processing times and reduced memory consumption. On the other hand, disabling it may lead to slower processing times and increased memory usage due to using a different compression algorithm."
