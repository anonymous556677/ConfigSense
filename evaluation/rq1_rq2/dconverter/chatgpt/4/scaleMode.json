    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'scaleMode' configuration is performance-sensitive because changing its value significantly impacts the system's memory consumption and execution time. Different scale modes may require different levels of computational resources and memory allocation, leading to notable variations in performance metrics."
