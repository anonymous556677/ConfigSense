    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'threadCount' configuration is performance-sensitive because changing the number of threads can have a significant impact on system performance. Increasing the thread count can lead to better parallelism and potentially faster execution times, but it can also increase memory consumption and introduce overhead due to context switching. Conversely, decreasing the thread count may result in slower execution times if the system is not utilizing the available resources efficiently. Therefore, the 'threadCount' configuration value change can notably affect system performance in terms of execution time and memory consumption."
