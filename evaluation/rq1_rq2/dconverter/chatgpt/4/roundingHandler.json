    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'roundingHandler' configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the precision of rounding operations in the 'dconverter' software. Changes in the roundingHandler value can lead to significant variations in execution time, especially when dealing with large datasets or complex calculations. This can result in noticeable performance differences and potential bottlenecks in the system."
