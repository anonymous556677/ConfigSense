    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'filesToProcess' configuration option is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the amount of data that the system needs to process. Increasing the value of 'filesToProcess' can lead to a significant increase in execution time and memory consumption, as the system has to handle a larger number of files. Conversely, decreasing the value can result in improved performance by reducing the workload on the system. Therefore, changes in the 'filesToProcess' configuration can have a notable impact on system performance."
