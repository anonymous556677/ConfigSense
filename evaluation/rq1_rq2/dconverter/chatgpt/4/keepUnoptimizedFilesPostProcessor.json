    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'keepUnoptimizedFilesPostProcessor' is performance-sensitive because changing its value can significantly impact system performance. If set to true, it may result in higher memory consumption and longer execution times as unoptimized files are retained, leading to increased processing overhead. On the other hand, setting it to false can improve performance by reducing memory usage and speeding up processing, making it a critical configuration for optimizing system performance."
