    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'skipUpscaling' configuration option is performance-sensitive because changing its value significantly affects system performance. When set to true, it skips the upscaling process, leading to faster execution time and lower memory consumption. However, when set to false, the upscaling process is performed, resulting in slower execution time and higher memory consumption. This variation in behavior directly impacts the overall system performance, making it a performance-sensitive configuration."
