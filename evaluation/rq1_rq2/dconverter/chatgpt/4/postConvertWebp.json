    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'postConvertWebp' configuration option is performance-sensitive because changing its value significantly impacts the system's performance. When set to true, the system needs to perform additional processing to convert images to the WebP format after conversion, which can lead to increased execution time and memory consumption. On the other hand, when set to false, this additional processing is avoided, resulting in improved performance. Therefore, the value of 'postConvertWebp' directly affects the system's performance, making it a performance-sensitive configuration."
