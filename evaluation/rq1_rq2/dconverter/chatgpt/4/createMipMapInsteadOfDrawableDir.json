    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'createMipMapInsteadOfDrawableDir' is performance-sensitive because changing this value can significantly impact system performance. When creating mipmaps instead of using a drawable directory, it can affect the memory consumption and rendering performance of the application. Mipmaps can improve image quality and rendering speed, but they also require more memory and processing power. Therefore, this configuration option can have a notable impact on execution time and memory usage."
