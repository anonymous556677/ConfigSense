    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The outputCompressionMode configuration is performance-sensitive because changing its value can significantly impact the system's performance. For example, enabling a high compression mode may increase the execution time and memory consumption of the system, while disabling compression may reduce these resources usage. Therefore, the value of outputCompressionMode directly affects the overall performance of the dconverter software project."
