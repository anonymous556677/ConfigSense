{
    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'includeAndroidLdpiTvdpi' is performance-sensitive. This is because the 'includeAndroidLdpiTvdpi' configuration directly affects the system performance by adding density descriptors for ldpi and tvdpi in the list, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The code snippet related to this configuration involves memory-expensive operations by creating new AndroidDensityDescriptor objects and adding them to the list, which can contribute to execution time and memory consumption. Therefore, based on the code context and the direct impact on system performance, the configuration is classified as performance-sensitive."
