{
    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'enableMozJpeg' is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that enabling 'MozJpeg' involves the use of the 'MozJpegProcessor' post-processor, which is a time-expensive operation. This post-processor has the potential to significantly impact system performance at the system level due to the processing of JPEG images. The 'MozJpegProcessor' operation contributes positively to execution time and memory consumption, leading to notable performance variations. Therefore, the configuration is considered performance-sensitive based on the code context and the potential impact on system performance."
