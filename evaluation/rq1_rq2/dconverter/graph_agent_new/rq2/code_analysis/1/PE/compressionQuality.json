    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'compressionQuality' is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the 'compressionQuality' directly affects the performance of the system at the system level. The code snippet related to the 'compressionQuality' configuration involves the 'compressJpeg' method, which is responsible for compressing JPEG images. The compression quality set in this method can have a significant impact on the execution time and memory consumption of the system, leading to notable performance variations. Therefore, the 'compressionQuality' configuration is considered performance-sensitive."
