    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'outputCompressionMode' is performance-sensitive. The code context shows that the 'outputCompressionMode' is directly used to determine the compression type for images, which involves time-expensive operations like scaling and compressing images based on the chosen compression mode. This can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, especially when dealing with large image files. Therefore, the configuration directly and substantially affects system performance, making it performance-sensitive."
