    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'threadCount' configuration option is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the 'threadCount' directly affects the ThreadPoolExecutor creation in the 'WorkerHandler' constructor. The number of threads in a ThreadPoolExecutor can significantly impact the performance of concurrent tasks execution. Additionally, the 'threadCount' value is used in various parts of the code to determine the number of threads for processing tasks, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
