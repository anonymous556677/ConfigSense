    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'createMipMapInsteadOfDrawableDir' is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the 'createMipMapInsteadOfDrawableDir' configuration directly impacts the directory prefix used in the 'getAndroidDensityDescriptors' method, which in turn affects the creation of different density descriptors for Android resources. This change in directory prefix can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, as it influences the loading and rendering of resources on different screen densities. Therefore, the configuration is considered performance-sensitive."
