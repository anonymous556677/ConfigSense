    "Reason": "The configuration option 'guiAdvancedOptions' is not performance-sensitive. The code snippet related to this configuration does not contain any performance-related operations that are time-expensive or memory-expensive. The configuration setting 'guiAdvancedOptions' is simply used to toggle between advanced and simple options for the GUI, which does not directly and substantially affect system performance at the system level."
