    "Reason": "The 'downScalingAlgorithm' configuration option is not performance-sensitive. The code snippet provided does not contain any performance-related operations that are time-expensive or memory-expensive. The configuration option simply retrieves the 'downScalingAlgorithm' value from the 'args' object and does not involve any operations that would lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
