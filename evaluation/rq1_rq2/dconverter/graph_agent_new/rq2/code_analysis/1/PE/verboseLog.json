    "Reason": "The 'verboseLog' configuration option is not performance-sensitive. The code snippet related to the 'verboseLog' configuration simply prints the log if the 'verboseLog' flag is set to true. This operation does not involve any time-expensive or memory-expensive operations that would lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Additionally, the 'verboseLog' configuration does not directly and substantially affect system performance, as it is mainly for logging purposes."
