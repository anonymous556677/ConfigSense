    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'upScalingAlgorithm' is not performance-sensitive. The code snippet related to this configuration does not contain any performance-related operations that are time-expensive or memory-expensive. The method 'getScalingAlgorithm' simply returns a scaling algorithm based on the input type, and the 'loadPrefs' method loads preferences without any significant performance impact. Therefore, this configuration does not lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
