    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'enableAntiAliasing' is performance-sensitive. The code snippet related to this configuration involves a performance-related operation that is time-expensive within its related code. Enabling anti-aliasing (cbAntiAliasing) involves applying a filter (OP_ANTIALIAS.filter) to the scaled image, which can have a notable performance impact at the system level. This operation contributes to increased execution time and memory consumption, making the configuration performance-sensitive."
