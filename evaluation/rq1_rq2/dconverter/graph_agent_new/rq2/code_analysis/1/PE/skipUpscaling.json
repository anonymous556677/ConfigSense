    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'skipUpscaling' does not directly involve any performance-related operations that are time-expensive or memory-expensive within its related code. The code snippet provided mainly deals with setting various preferences based on the arguments retrieved from the preference store. There are no operations that would lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Therefore, the 'skipUpscaling' configuration is not classified as performance-sensitive."
