    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'postConvertWebp' is performance-sensitive. This is because enabling 'postConvertWebp' involves the use of the 'WebpProcessor' post-processor, which is a time-expensive operation. The 'postConvertWebp' configuration directly impacts the execution time and memory consumption within the 'execute' method. The 'postConvertWebp' configuration leads to the addition of the 'cwebp' postprocessor, which can significantly affect system performance at the system level by introducing notable performance variations."
