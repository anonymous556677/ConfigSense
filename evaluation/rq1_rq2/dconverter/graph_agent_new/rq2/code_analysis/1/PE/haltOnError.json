    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'haltOnError' is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the 'haltOnError' configuration directly affects the system performance at the system level. In the provided code context, the 'haltOnError' configuration is checked within the 'onJobFinished' method, and if it is set to true, the system will be halted immediately by shutting down the thread pool and invoking the callback with the 'true' flag. This operation can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, making it a performance-sensitive configuration."
