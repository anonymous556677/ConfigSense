{
    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'skipExistingFiles' is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the 'skipExistingFiles' configuration directly affects the performance of the system at the system level. In the provided code context, the 'skipExistingFiles' configuration is used to check if an image file already exists before saving it. This check can lead to notable performance variations as it determines whether certain time-expensive operations like scaling and compressing the image need to be performed. Therefore, the 'skipExistingFiles' configuration is considered performance-sensitive based on its impact on system performance."
