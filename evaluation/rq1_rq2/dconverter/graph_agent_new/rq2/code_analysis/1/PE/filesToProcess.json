    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The 'filesToProcess' configuration option is not performance-sensitive. Although the 'filesToProcess' variable is used in the code context to iterate over files for processing, it does not directly involve any time-expensive or memory-expensive operations that significantly impact system performance at the system level. The code snippet primarily focuses on file handling and image processing tasks, which do not exhibit notable performance variations based on the 'filesToProcess' configuration."
