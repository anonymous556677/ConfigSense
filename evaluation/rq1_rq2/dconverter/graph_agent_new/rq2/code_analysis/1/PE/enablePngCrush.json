    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'enablePngCrush' is performance-sensitive. The 'enablePngCrush' configuration involves the use of the 'PngCrushProcessor' postprocessor, which is added to the list of postprocessors if the configuration is enabled. The 'PngCrushProcessor' is a performance-related operation that can have a notable performance impact, as it involves processing PNG files. This operation contributes positively to execution time and memory consumption, leading to notable performance variations at the system level. Therefore, based on the configuration-related code analysis, the 'enablePngCrush' configuration is classified as performance-sensitive."
