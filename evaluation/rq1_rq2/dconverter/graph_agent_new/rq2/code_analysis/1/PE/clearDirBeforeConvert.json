    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'clearDirBeforeConvert' is performance-sensitive. This is because the 'clearDirBeforeConvert' configuration involves performance-related operations that are time-expensive within its related code. Specifically, the 'clear out dirs before convert' operation in the 'execute' method can have a notable performance impact at the system level by potentially affecting the execution time and memory consumption. This operation directly and substantially affects system performance, making the configuration performance-sensitive."
