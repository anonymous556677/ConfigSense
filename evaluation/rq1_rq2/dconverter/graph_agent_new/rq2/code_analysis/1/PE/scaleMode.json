    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'scaleMode' is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the 'scaleMode' configuration directly impacts the performance of the system at the system level. The 'scaleMode' configuration involves performance-related operations that are time-extensive within its related code, such as determining density buckets based on different scaling modes. These operations contribute significantly to execution time and memory consumption, leading to notable performance variations at the system level."
