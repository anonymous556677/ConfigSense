    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'dryRun' configuration option is performance-sensitive. This is because the 'dryRun' configuration is directly used in the code context to determine whether certain operations should be executed or not. The 'dryRun' configuration affects the execution flow and resource consumption within the 'createMainSubFolder', 'onPreExecute', 'convert', 'createFolderForOutputFile', and 'loadPrefs' methods. Depending on the value of 'dryRun', significant performance variations can occur at the system level, making it a performance-sensitive configuration."
