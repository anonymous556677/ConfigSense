    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'keepUnoptimizedFilesPostProcessor' is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the configuration directly affects system performance at the system level by enabling or disabling the optimization of files. The code snippet related to this configuration shows that when 'cbKeepUnoptimized' is selected, it leads to additional processing and storage of unoptimized files, which can have a notable impact on memory consumption and execution time. Therefore, this configuration can cause significant performance variations at the system level."
