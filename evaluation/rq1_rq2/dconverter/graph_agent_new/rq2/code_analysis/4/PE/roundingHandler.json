    "Reason": "The 'roundingHandler' configuration option does not appear to be performance-sensitive based on the provided code context. The 'choiceRounding' configuration setting is being loaded from the preference store, but there are no performance-intensive operations related to this configuration setting within the code snippet. The 'roundingHandler' configuration does not involve any time-expensive or memory-expensive operations that would lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
