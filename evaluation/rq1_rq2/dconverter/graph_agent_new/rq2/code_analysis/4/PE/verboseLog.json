    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'verboseLog' configuration option is considered performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the 'verboseLog' option directly affects the execution time and memory consumption of the system at the system level. When 'args.verboseLog' is true, additional logging information is printed, which can significantly impact the performance of the system, especially when dealing with large amounts of data. This extra logging operation is time-expensive and memory-expensive, leading to notable performance variations. Therefore, the 'verboseLog' configuration is classified as performance-sensitive."
