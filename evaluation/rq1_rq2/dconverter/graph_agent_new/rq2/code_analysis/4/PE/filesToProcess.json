    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'filesToProcess' is performance-sensitive. The code snippet related to the 'filesToProcess' configuration involves time-expensive and memory-expensive operations such as processing image files, adding converters and post-processors, and handling progress updates. These operations directly impact the system performance at the system level by executing multiple jobs concurrently and managing processing queues efficiently. The configuration's involvement in these performance-related operations leads to notable performance variations, making it performance-sensitive."
