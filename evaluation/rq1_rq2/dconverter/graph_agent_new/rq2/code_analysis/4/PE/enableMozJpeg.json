    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'enableMozJpeg' is performance-sensitive. This is because enabling 'MozJpeg' involves the use of 'MozJpegProcessor' post-processor, which is a time-expensive operation within the 'execute' method. The 'MozJpegProcessor' is added to the list of post-processors only if the 'args.enableMozJpeg' is true, and it checks if the 'jpegtran' tool is accessible. This operation directly affects system performance by adding additional processing tasks and potentially increasing execution time. Therefore, the configuration is considered performance-sensitive."
