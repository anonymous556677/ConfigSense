{
    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'createMipMapInsteadOfDrawableDir' is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the 'createMipMapInsteadOfDrawableDir' configuration directly affects the directory prefix used in the 'getAndroidDensityDescriptors' method. Depending on the value of 'createMipMapInsteadOfDrawableDir', the method will either use 'mipmap' or 'drawable' as the directory prefix, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. This configuration directly impacts the performance-related operations within the 'getAndroidDensityDescriptors' method, making it performance-sensitive."
