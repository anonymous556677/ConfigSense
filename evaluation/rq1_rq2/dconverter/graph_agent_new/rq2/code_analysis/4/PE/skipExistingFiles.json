    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'skipExistingFiles' is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the 'skipExistingFiles' configuration directly impacts the performance of the system at the system level. In the provided code context, the 'skipExistingFiles' configuration is used to check if an image file already exists before processing it. If the file exists and 'skipExistingFiles' is set to true, the processing is skipped, which can lead to a notable performance variation in the system level by avoiding unnecessary processing of existing files. This configuration involves time-expensive operations that can significantly affect the overall performance of the system."
