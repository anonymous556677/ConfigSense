    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'outputCompressionMode' is performance-sensitive. The code context reveals that the 'outputCompressionMode' directly influences the compression type used for images, which can have a significant impact on the execution time and memory consumption of image processing operations. The method 'getOutCompressionForType' dynamically selects compression types based on the specified mode, indicating that different modes can lead to varying levels of performance impact at the system level."
