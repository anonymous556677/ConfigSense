{
    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'enablePngCrush' is performance-sensitive. This is because enabling 'enablePngCrush' triggers the execution of the 'PngCrushProcessor' post-processor, which involves time-expensive and memory-expensive operations related to image processing. These operations directly impact system performance at the system level by adding additional processing overhead, leading to notable performance variations. Therefore, the configuration is classified as performance-sensitive."
