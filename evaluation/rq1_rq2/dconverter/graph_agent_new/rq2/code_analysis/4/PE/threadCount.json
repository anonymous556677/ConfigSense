    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'threadCount' configuration option is performance-sensitive. This is because the 'threadCount' value directly affects the ThreadPoolExecutor creation in the 'WorkerHandler' constructor, which in turn impacts the number of threads available for processing tasks. The 'threadCount' value is used in various parts of the code to determine the number of threads to be used for image conversion and post-processing tasks. A higher 'threadCount' value can lead to increased parallelism and potentially better performance, while a lower value may limit the system's processing capabilities. Therefore, the 'threadCount' configuration has a direct and substantial impact on system performance at the system level."
