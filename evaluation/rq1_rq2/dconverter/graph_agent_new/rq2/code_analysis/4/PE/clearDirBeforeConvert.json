    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'clearDirBeforeConvert' is performance-sensitive. This is because the 'clearDirBeforeConvert' configuration involves performance-related operations that are time-expensive within its related code. Specifically, the 'clearDirBeforeConvert' configuration triggers the cleaning of directories before conversion, which can have a notable performance impact at the system level. This operation can lead to significant performance variations, especially when dealing with a large number of files to process. Therefore, based on the code context and the nature of the operation, the 'clearDirBeforeConvert' configuration is classified as performance-sensitive."
