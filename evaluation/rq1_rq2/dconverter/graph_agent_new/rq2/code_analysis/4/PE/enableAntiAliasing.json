    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'enableAntiAliasing' is performance-sensitive. The code snippet related to this configuration involves a performance-related operation that applies anti-aliasing filtering to the scaled image. Anti-aliasing is a time-expensive operation that can significantly impact system performance at the system level, especially when processing large images. Therefore, enabling anti-aliasing can lead to notable performance variations, making this configuration performance-sensitive."
