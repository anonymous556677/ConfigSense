{
    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'compressionQuality' is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the 'compressionQuality' directly affects the performance of the system at the system level. The code snippet related to the 'compressionQuality' configuration involves time-expensive operations such as compressing JPEG images using the 'compressJpeg' method. This compression operation can have a notable performance impact on the system, especially when dealing with large image files. Therefore, the 'compressionQuality' configuration is considered performance-sensitive."
