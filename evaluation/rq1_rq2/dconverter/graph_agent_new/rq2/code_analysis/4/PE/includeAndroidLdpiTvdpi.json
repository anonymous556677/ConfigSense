    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'includeAndroidLdpiTvdpi' is performance-sensitive. This is because the 'includeAndroidLdpiTvdpi' configuration directly affects the system performance by including 'ldpi' and 'tvdpi' density descriptors in the list, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The code snippet related to this configuration involves memory-expensive operations by adding density descriptors based on the 'includeAndroidLdpiTvdpi' flag, which can have a significant impact on the overall performance of the system."
