{
    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'postConvertWebp' is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the 'postConvertWebp' configuration involves the 'WebpProcessor' post-processor, which is a performance-related operation that can have a notable performance impact at the system level. The 'postConvertWebp' configuration triggers the 'add cwebp postprocessor' operation, which can consume significant time and memory resources during image conversion. This operation directly affects the overall performance of the system by introducing additional processing overhead. Therefore, the 'postConvertWebp' configuration is considered performance-sensitive based on the code context and the impact of the related performance operations."
