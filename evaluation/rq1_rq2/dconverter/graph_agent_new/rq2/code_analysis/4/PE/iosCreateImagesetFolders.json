    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'iosCreateImagesetFolders' is performance-sensitive. This is because the 'iosCreateImagesetFolders' configuration directly affects the system performance at the system level by creating image set folders, which involves time-expensive and memory-expensive operations. The code context shows that when 'iosCreateImagesetFolders' is true, it creates and checks a folder for each image set, which can lead to notable performance variations. Additionally, the 'onPreExecute' method also performs operations based on the 'iosCreateImagesetFolders' configuration, further emphasizing its performance sensitivity."
