    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'scaleMode' is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the 'scaleMode' configuration directly affects the performance of the system at the system level. The 'scaleMode' configuration is used in the 'getDensityBuckets' method, which performs operations based on the 'scaleMode' value, leading to notable performance variations. The 'scaleMode' configuration involves performance-related operations that are time-expensive within its related code, impacting the overall system performance significantly."
