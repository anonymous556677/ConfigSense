{
    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'enablePngCrush' is performance-sensitive. This is because enabling 'enablePngCrush' triggers the execution of the PngCrushProcessor postprocessor, which involves time-expensive and memory-expensive operations related to image processing. These operations directly impact the system performance at the system level by adding additional processing overhead. The code snippet related to 'enablePngCrush' clearly shows the involvement of postprocessors and the potential impact on performance, making it a performance-sensitive configuration."
