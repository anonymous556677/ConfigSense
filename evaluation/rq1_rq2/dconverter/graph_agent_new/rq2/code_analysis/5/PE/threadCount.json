    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'threadCount' configuration is performance-sensitive. The 'threadCount' configuration directly affects the performance of the system at the system level by defining the number of threads in the ThreadPoolExecutor. The 'threadCount' configuration influences the execution time and memory consumption of the program by determining the concurrency level. The code snippet provided clearly shows that the 'threadCount' configuration is used to initialize the ThreadPoolExecutor, which directly impacts the performance of the program by controlling the number of threads available for processing tasks. Therefore, based on the code context and its direct impact on system performance, the 'threadCount' configuration is classified as performance-sensitive."
