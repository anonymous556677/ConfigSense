{
    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'enableAntiAliasing' is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that enabling anti-aliasing (cbAntiAliasing) involves a performance-related operation that applies a filter (OP_ANTIALIAS.filter) to the scaled image. Anti-aliasing is a time-expensive operation that can significantly impact the system's performance at the system level by affecting the execution time and memory consumption. Therefore, the configuration directly and substantially affects system performance, making it performance-sensitive."
