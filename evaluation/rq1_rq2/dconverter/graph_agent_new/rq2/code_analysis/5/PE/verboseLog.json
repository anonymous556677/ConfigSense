    "Reason": "The configuration option 'verboseLog' is not performance-sensitive. The code snippet related to the 'verboseLog' configuration does not contain any performance-intensive operations. The 'verboseLog' configuration simply controls whether to print additional log information, which does not directly and substantially affect system performance at the system level. Additionally, the unclear code snippet provided is a utility method for displaying a progress bar in the command line interface, which is not directly related to the 'verboseLog' configuration."
