    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'clearDirBeforeConvert' is performance-sensitive. This is because the 'clearDirBeforeConvert' configuration involves performance-related operations within the 'execute' method. Specifically, the 'clearDirBeforeConvert' configuration triggers the clearing of directories before conversion, which can have a substantial impact on system performance. This operation directly affects the execution time and memory consumption at the system level, leading to notable performance variations. Therefore, based on the code context and the nature of the operation, the 'clearDirBeforeConvert' configuration is classified as performance-sensitive."
