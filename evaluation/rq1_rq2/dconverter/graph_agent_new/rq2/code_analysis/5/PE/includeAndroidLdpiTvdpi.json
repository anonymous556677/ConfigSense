    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'includeAndroidLdpiTvdpi' is performance-sensitive. This is because the 'includeAndroidLdpiTvdpi' configuration directly affects the system performance by adding density descriptors for 'ldpi' and 'tvdpi' densities, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The code snippet related to this configuration involves memory-expensive operations like adding density descriptors to the list based on the 'includeAndroidLdpiTvdpi' value, which can significantly impact the execution time and memory consumption of the system."
