    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'iosCreateImagesetFolders' is performance-sensitive. This is because the 'iosCreateImagesetFolders' configuration directly affects the system performance by creating additional image set folders in the destination folder. This operation involves time-expensive and memory-expensive operations, such as creating and checking folders, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The configuration-related code snippet clearly shows that the creation of image set folders is dependent on the value of 'iosCreateImagesetFolders', indicating its performance sensitivity."
