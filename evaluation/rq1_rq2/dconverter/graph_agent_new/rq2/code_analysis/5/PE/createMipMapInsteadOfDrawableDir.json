{
    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'createMipMapInsteadOfDrawableDir' is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the 'createMipMapInsteadOfDrawableDir' configuration directly affects the directory prefix used in the 'getAndroidDensityDescriptors' method, which in turn impacts the creation of different density descriptors for Android resources. This change in directory prefix can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, as it affects the loading and rendering of resources based on different screen densities. Therefore, the configuration is considered performance-sensitive due to its direct and substantial impact on system performance."
