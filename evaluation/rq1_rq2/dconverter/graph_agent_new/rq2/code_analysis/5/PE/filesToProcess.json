    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'filesToProcess' configuration is performance-sensitive. The configuration directly affects system performance at the system level by iterating over each file in 'args.filesToProcess' and performing various operations on them. This involves time-expensive and memory-expensive operations such as image conversion and post-processing, which can lead to notable performance variations. The configuration also involves multiple nested loops and callbacks, which can further impact performance. Overall, the configuration has a significant performance impact on the system level."
