    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'skipExistingFiles' is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the 'skipExistingFiles' configuration directly affects the performance of the system at the system level. In the provided code context, the 'skipExistingFiles' configuration is used to check if an image file already exists and skip processing it if it does. This check can potentially save time and resources by avoiding unnecessary processing of existing files, leading to notable performance variations at the system level."
