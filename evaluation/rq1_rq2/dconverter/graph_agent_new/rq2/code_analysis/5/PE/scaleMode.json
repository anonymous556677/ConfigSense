{
    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'scaleMode' is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the 'scaleMode' configuration directly affects the performance of the system at the system level. The 'scaleMode' configuration is used in the 'getDensityBuckets' method, which determines the density buckets based on the scale mode. Depending on the 'scaleMode' chosen, different calculations are performed to determine the dimensions of the images, which can have a significant impact on the performance of image processing operations. Therefore, the 'scaleMode' configuration is considered performance-sensitive."
