    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'outputCompressionMode' is performance-sensitive. The code context shows that the 'outputCompressionMode' directly affects the performance of image processing operations by determining the compression type for different image formats. The method 'getOutCompressionForType' dynamically selects compression types based on the specified output compression mode, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The choice of compression type directly impacts the execution time and memory consumption of image processing tasks, making this configuration performance-sensitive."
