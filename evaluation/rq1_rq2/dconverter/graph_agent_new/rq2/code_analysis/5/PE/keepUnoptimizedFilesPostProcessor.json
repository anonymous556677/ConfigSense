    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'keepUnoptimizedFilesPostProcessor' is classified as performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the configuration directly affects system performance at the system level by enabling or disabling the optimization of files. The code snippet related to this configuration shows that when 'cbKeepUnoptimized' is selected, it triggers certain performance-related operations such as skipping optimization and keeping files unoptimized. These operations can be time-expensive and memory-expensive, leading to notable performance variations at the system level."
