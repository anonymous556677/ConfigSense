    "Reason": "The 'roundingHandler' configuration option is not performance-sensitive. The code snippet related to 'roundingHandler' configuration does not contain any performance-related operations that are time-expensive or memory-expensive. The configuration setting 'choiceRounding' is simply being selected based on the 'args.roundingHandler' value, which does not directly and substantially affect system performance at the system level."
