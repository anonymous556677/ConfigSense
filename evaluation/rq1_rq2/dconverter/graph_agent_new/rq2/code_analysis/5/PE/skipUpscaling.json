    "Reason": "The configuration option 'skipUpscaling' does not appear to be performance-sensitive based on the provided code context. The 'skipUpscaling' configuration setting is simply being retrieved and set in the loadPrefs method, and there are no performance-intensive operations related to this configuration within the code snippet. The configuration setting does not involve any time-expensive or memory-expensive operations that would lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
