    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'enableMozJpeg' is performance-sensitive. This is because enabling 'MozJpeg' involves the use of the 'MozJpegProcessor' post-processor, which is a time-expensive operation within the 'execute' method. The 'MozJpegProcessor' is added to the list of post-processors if 'args.enableMozJpeg' is true, and it checks if the 'jpegtran' tool is accessible. This additional processing step can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, making the configuration performance-sensitive."
