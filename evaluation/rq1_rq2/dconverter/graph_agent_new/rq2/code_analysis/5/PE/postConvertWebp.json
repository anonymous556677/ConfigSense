    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'postConvertWebp' is performance-sensitive. This is because enabling this option triggers the execution of the 'WebpProcessor' post-processor, which involves time-expensive and memory-expensive operations related to converting images to WebP format. These operations can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, affecting the overall execution time and memory consumption of the system. Therefore, the configuration directly and substantially affects system performance, making it performance-sensitive."
