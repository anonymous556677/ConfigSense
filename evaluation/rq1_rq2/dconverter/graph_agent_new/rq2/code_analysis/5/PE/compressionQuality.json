    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'compressionQuality' is performance-sensitive. This is because the 'compressionQuality' directly affects the performance of the system at the system level. The 'compressionQuality' is used in the 'compressJpeg' method, which is a time-expensive operation as it involves compressing images. The quality of compression directly impacts the execution time and memory consumption of the system, leading to notable performance variations. Therefore, the 'compressionQuality' configuration is considered performance-sensitive."
