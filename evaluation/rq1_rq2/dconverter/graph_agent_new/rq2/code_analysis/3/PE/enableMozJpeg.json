    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'enableMozJpeg' is performance-sensitive. This is because enabling 'MozJpeg' involves the instantiation of a 'MozJpegProcessor' post-processor, which is a performance-related operation that can have a notable performance impact. The 'MozJpegProcessor' is added to the list of post-processors, and its support is checked before adding it. Additionally, enabling 'MozJpeg' affects the number of jobs for both conversion and post-processing, leading to notable performance variations at the system level."
