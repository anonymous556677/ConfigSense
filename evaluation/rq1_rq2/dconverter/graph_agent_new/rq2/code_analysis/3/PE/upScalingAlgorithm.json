    "Reason": "The configuration option 'upScalingAlgorithm' is not performance-sensitive. The code snippet provided does not contain any performance-related operations that are time-expensive or memory-expensive. The 'upScalingAlgorithm' configuration is simply being retrieved based on the input type, without any significant impact on system performance at the system level."
