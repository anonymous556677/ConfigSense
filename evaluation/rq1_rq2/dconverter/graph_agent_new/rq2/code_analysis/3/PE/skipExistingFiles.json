    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'skipExistingFiles' is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the 'skipExistingFiles' configuration directly affects the system performance at the system level. In the provided code context, the 'skipExistingFiles' configuration is used to check if an image file already exists before processing it. If the file exists, the loop is broken, which can potentially save processing time. This configuration involves a performance-related operation that contributes positively to execution time by skipping unnecessary processing steps, leading to notable performance variations at the system level."
