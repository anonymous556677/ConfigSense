    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'threadCount' configuration option is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the 'threadCount' configuration directly affects the ThreadPoolExecutor creation in the 'WorkerHandler' constructor. The number of threads specified in 'threadCount' impacts the parallelism and concurrency of the system, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Additionally, the 'threadCount' configuration is used in the 'execute' method to determine the number of threads used for processing files, further emphasizing its impact on system performance."
