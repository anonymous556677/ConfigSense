    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'skipUpscaling' does not appear to be performance-sensitive based on the provided code context. The 'skipUpscaling' configuration setting is simply being retrieved and set in the loadPrefs method, without any performance-intensive operations associated with it. The code snippet does not show any performance-related operations that would lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Therefore, the 'skipUpscaling' configuration can be classified as not performance-sensitive."
