    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'includeAndroidLdpiTvdpi' is performance-sensitive. This is because the 'includeAndroidLdpiTvdpi' configuration directly affects the system performance by adding density descriptors for ldpi and tvdpi, which involve performance-related operations that contribute to execution time and memory consumption. The code snippet in the 'getAndroidDensityDescriptors' method shows that when 'includeAndroidLdpiTvdpi' is true, density descriptors for ldpi and tvdpi are added, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
