    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'filesToProcess' configuration option is performance-sensitive. This is because the 'filesToProcess' configuration directly affects the execution time and memory consumption of the system at the system level. The code snippet related to 'filesToProcess' involves iterating over files to be processed, performing various image conversion tasks, and handling progress updates. These operations are time-expensive and memory-expensive, leading to notable performance variations at the system level. Additionally, the configuration interacts with multiple converters and post-processors, further increasing its performance impact."
