{
    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'haltOnError' is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the 'haltOnError' configuration directly affects system performance at the system level. In the provided code context, if 'haltOnError' is set to true, it triggers the cancellation of the current job, shutdown of the thread pool, and immediate callback execution. These operations are time-expensive and can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, making the 'haltOnError' configuration performance-sensitive."
