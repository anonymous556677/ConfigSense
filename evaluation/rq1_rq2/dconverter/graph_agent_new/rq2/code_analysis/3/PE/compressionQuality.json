    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'compressionQuality' is performance-sensitive. This is because the 'compressionQuality' directly affects the performance of the system by determining the quality of the compressed images. The code snippet related to the 'compressionQuality' configuration involves time-expensive operations such as compressing images using different compression algorithms and quality settings. These operations can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, making the 'compressionQuality' configuration performance-sensitive."
