    "Reason": "The configuration option 'guiAdvancedOptions' is not performance-sensitive. The code snippet provided does not contain any performance-related operations that are time-expensive or memory-expensive. The configuration setting 'guiAdvancedOptions' is simply used to determine whether to use advanced options or simple options for the GUI, which does not directly and substantially affect system performance at the system level."
