    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'clearDirBeforeConvert' is performance-sensitive. This is because the 'clearDirBeforeConvert' option directly affects the system performance at the system level by triggering the clearing of directories before conversion, which involves time-expensive and memory-expensive operations within the related code. The code snippet in the 'execute' method shows that if 'args.clearDirBeforeConvert' is true, it will clear out directories before conversion, which involves additional processing and memory usage. This operation can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, making it performance-sensitive."
