    "Reason": "The configuration option 'downScalingAlgorithm' is not performance-sensitive based on the provided code context. The 'downScalingAlgorithm' is simply being retrieved from the 'args' object and set to a choice box in the UI. There are no performance-intensive operations related to this configuration in the code snippet provided. Therefore, it does not directly and substantially affect system performance at the system level."
