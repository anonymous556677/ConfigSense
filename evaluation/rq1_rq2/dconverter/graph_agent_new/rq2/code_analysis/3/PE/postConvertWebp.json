    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'postConvertWebp' is performance-sensitive. This is because the 'postConvertWebp' configuration involves the 'WebpProcessor' post-processor operation, which is a time-expensive operation that directly affects system performance at the system level. The code snippet related to this configuration shows that the 'postConvertWebp' operation adds a 'cwebp' postprocessor, which can have a notable performance impact due to its time-expensive nature. Therefore, the configuration is considered performance-sensitive based on the code context and the nature of the operation."
