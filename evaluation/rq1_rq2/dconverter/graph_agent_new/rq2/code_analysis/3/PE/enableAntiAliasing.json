{
    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'enableAntiAliasing' is performance-sensitive. This is because enabling anti-aliasing (cbAntiAliasing) involves a performance-related operation (OP_ANTIALIAS.filter) that can significantly impact the system performance at the system level. Anti-aliasing operations are known to be time-expensive and memory-expensive, which can lead to notable performance variations in the system. Therefore, the configuration is classified as performance-sensitive based on the code context and the nature of the operation it triggers."
