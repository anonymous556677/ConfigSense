    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'createMipMapInsteadOfDrawableDir' is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the 'createMipMapInsteadOfDrawableDir' configuration directly affects the directory prefix used in the 'getAndroidDensityDescriptors' method, which in turn impacts the creation of Android density descriptors. This change in directory prefix can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, especially when dealing with different screen densities in Android development. Therefore, the configuration is considered performance-sensitive."
