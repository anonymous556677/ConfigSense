    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'scaleMode' is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the 'scaleMode' configuration directly impacts the performance of the system at the system level. The 'scaleMode' configuration involves performance-related operations that are time-expensive within its related code, such as determining the scaling mode based on 'args.scaleMode' and executing different operations accordingly. These operations contribute significantly to the execution time and memory consumption of the system, leading to notable performance variations at the system level."
