    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'outputCompressionMode' is performance-sensitive. The code context reveals that the 'outputCompressionMode' directly impacts the performance of image processing operations by determining the compression types to be used. The method 'getOutCompressionForType' maps the output compression mode to specific image compression types, which are crucial for image scaling and file saving processes. The choice of compression types can significantly affect the execution time and memory consumption of these operations, leading to notable performance variations at the system level."
