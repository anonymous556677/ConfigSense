    "Reason": "The configuration option 'skipUpscaling' is not performance-sensitive based on the provided code context. The 'skipUpscaling' configuration setting is simply being retrieved from the preference store and set to a checkbox in the user interface. There are no performance-related operations within the code snippet that suggest significant performance impact at the system level. The configuration setting does not involve any time-expensive or memory-expensive operations that would lead to notable performance variations."
