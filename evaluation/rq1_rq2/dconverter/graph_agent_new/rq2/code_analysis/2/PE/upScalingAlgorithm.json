    "Reason": "The configuration option 'upScalingAlgorithm' is not performance-sensitive. The code snippet provided does not contain any performance-related operations that are time-expensive or memory-expensive. The method 'getScalingAlgorithm' simply returns the 'upScalingAlgorithm' or 'downScalingAlgorithm' based on the input type, which does not directly and substantially affect system performance at the system level."
