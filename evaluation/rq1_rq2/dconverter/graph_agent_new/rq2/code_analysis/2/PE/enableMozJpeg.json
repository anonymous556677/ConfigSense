    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'enableMozJpeg' is performance-sensitive. This is because enabling 'MozJpeg' involves the instantiation and execution of 'MozJpegProcessor' within the 'execute' method. The 'MozJpegProcessor' is a post-processor that is added to the list of post-processors if 'args.enableMozJpeg' is true. This post-processor contributes to notable performance variations at the system level by potentially processing a large number of files, as indicated by the calculation of 'postProcessorJobs'. Additionally, the 'MozJpegProcessor' may not be supported if the 'jpegtran' tool is not accessible, leading to potential performance issues. Therefore, the configuration option 'enableMozJpeg' is considered performance-sensitive based on the code context and its impact on system performance."
