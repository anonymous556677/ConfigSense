    "Reason": "The configuration option 'iosCreateImagesetFolders' is performance-sensitive. This is because the 'iosCreateImagesetFolders' configuration directly affects the system performance by creating image set folders, which involves time-expensive and memory-expensive operations within the related code. The creation of image set folders can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, making it a performance-sensitive configuration."
