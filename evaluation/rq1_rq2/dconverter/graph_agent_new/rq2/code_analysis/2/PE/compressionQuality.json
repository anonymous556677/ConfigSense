    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'compressionQuality' is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the 'compressionQuality' directly affects the performance of the system at the system level. The code snippet related to the 'compressionQuality' configuration involves time-expensive operations such as compressing JPEG images with a specified quality level. This operation can lead to notable performance variations in terms of execution time and memory consumption at the system level, making it a performance-sensitive configuration."
