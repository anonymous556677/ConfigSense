    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'enableAntiAliasing' is performance-sensitive. The code snippet related to this configuration involves a performance-related operation that applies anti-aliasing filtering to the scaled image. Anti-aliasing is a time-expensive operation that can have a notable performance impact on the system level, especially when dealing with large images. Therefore, enabling anti-aliasing through this configuration can lead to significant performance variations in the system."
