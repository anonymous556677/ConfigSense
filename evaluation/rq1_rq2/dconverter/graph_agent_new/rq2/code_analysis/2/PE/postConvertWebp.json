    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'postConvertWebp' is performance-sensitive. This is because enabling 'postConvertWebp' involves the use of the 'WebpProcessor' postprocessor, which is a time-expensive operation that converts images to the WebP format. This operation can lead to notable performance variations at the system level due to the additional processing required for image conversion. Additionally, the 'postConvertWebp' configuration directly impacts the execution time and memory consumption within the 'execute' method, making it a performance-sensitive configuration."
