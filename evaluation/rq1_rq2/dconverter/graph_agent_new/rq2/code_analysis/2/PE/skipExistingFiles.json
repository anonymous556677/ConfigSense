    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'skipExistingFiles' is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the 'skipExistingFiles' configuration directly affects the performance of the system at the system level. In the provided code context, the 'skipExistingFiles' configuration is used to check if an image file already exists before saving it. If the file already exists, the loop is broken, which can potentially save time and resources by skipping unnecessary file saving operations. This configuration involves a performance-related operation that contributes positively to execution time by avoiding redundant file operations, leading to notable performance variations at the system level."
