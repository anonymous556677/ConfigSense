    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'includeAndroidLdpiTvdpi' is not performance-sensitive. The code snippet related to this configuration involves adding AndroidDensityDescriptors based on the value of 'includeAndroidLdpiTvdpi', which does not contain any time-expensive or memory-expensive operations. The configuration itself does not directly and substantially affect system performance at the system level, leading to notable performance variations. Therefore, it is classified as not performance-sensitive."
