    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'keepUnoptimizedFilesPostProcessor' is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the configuration directly affects system performance at the system level by enabling or disabling the optimization of files. The code snippet related to this configuration shows that when 'cbKeepUnoptimized' is selected, it triggers certain performance-related operations such as skipping optimization and keeping files unoptimized, which can lead to notable performance variations in terms of memory consumption and execution time."
