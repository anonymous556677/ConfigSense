{
    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'enablePngCrush' is performance-sensitive. This is because enabling 'enablePngCrush' triggers the execution of the 'PngCrushProcessor' post-processor, which involves time-expensive and memory-expensive operations. The 'PngCrushProcessor' post-processor is directly related to image processing and compression, which can have a notable performance impact at the system level. Additionally, the code snippet related to enabling 'enablePngCrush' shows that it adds the 'PngCrushProcessor' to the list of post-processors, which indicates that it contributes to the overall execution time and memory consumption of the system."
