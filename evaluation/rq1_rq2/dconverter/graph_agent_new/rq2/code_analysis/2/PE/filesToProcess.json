    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'filesToProcess' configuration option is performance-sensitive. This is because the 'filesToProcess' configuration directly affects the execution time and memory consumption of the system at the system level. The code snippet related to 'filesToProcess' involves iterating over the files to be processed, performing various image processing tasks, and handling progress updates. These operations are time-expensive and memory-expensive, leading to notable performance variations at the system level. Additionally, the configuration involves multiple post-processing tasks and converters, which further contribute to the performance sensitivity of the 'filesToProcess' configuration."
