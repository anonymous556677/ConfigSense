    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'scaleMode' is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the 'scaleMode' directly affects the performance of the system at the system level. The 'scaleMode' configuration involves performance-related operations that are time-extensive within its related code, such as determining the scaling mode based on the 'args.scaleMode' value. This can lead to notable performance variations in the system, making it performance-sensitive."
