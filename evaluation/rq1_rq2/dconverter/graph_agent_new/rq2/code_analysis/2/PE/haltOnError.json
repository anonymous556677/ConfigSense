{
    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'haltOnError' is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the 'haltOnError' configuration directly affects the system performance at the system level. In the provided code context, when 'haltOnError' is true, it leads to the cancellation of the current job, shutdown of the thread pool, and immediate callback execution. These operations are time-expensive and can significantly impact the overall performance of the system. Therefore, the 'haltOnError' configuration is considered performance-sensitive."
