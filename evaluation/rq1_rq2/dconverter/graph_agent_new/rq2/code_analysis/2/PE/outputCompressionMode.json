    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'outputCompressionMode' is performance-sensitive. The code context shows that the 'outputCompressionMode' directly influences the compression type used for image processing, which can have a significant impact on both time-expensive and memory-expensive operations. The method 'getOutCompressionForType' determines the compression types based on the configuration, indicating that the choice of compression mode can lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
