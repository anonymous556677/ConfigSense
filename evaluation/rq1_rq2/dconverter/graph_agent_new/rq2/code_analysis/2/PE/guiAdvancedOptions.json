    "Reason": "The configuration option 'guiAdvancedOptions' is not performance-sensitive. The code snippet provided does not contain any performance-related operations that are time-expensive or memory-expensive. The configuration setting 'guiAdvancedOptions' is simply used to set a radio button based on the value of 'args.guiAdvancedOptions', which does not directly and substantially affect system performance at the system level."
