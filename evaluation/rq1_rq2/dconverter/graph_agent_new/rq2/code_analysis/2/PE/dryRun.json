    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'dryRun' configuration option is performance-sensitive. This is because the 'dryRun' configuration directly affects the execution of certain performance-related operations within the code. The 'dryRun' configuration is used in conditional statements to determine whether certain resource-intensive operations should be executed or not. Depending on the value of 'dryRun', the program may skip or execute resource-intensive tasks, leading to notable performance variations at the system level. Therefore, the 'dryRun' configuration is considered performance-sensitive."
