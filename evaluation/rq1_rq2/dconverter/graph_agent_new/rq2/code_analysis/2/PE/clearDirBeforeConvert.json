    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'clearDirBeforeConvert' is performance-sensitive. This is because the 'clearDirBeforeConvert' configuration involves performance-related operations that directly impact system performance at the system level. In the code context provided, the 'clearDirBeforeConvert' configuration triggers the clearing of directories before conversion, which can have a notable performance impact, especially when dealing with a large number of files to process. This operation can be time-expensive and memory-expensive, leading to significant performance variations at the system level."
