    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'compressionQuality' configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the execution time and memory consumption of the system. The quality of compression set in this configuration affects the file size of compressed images, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The code snippet related to the 'compressionQuality' configuration involves time-expensive operations like image scaling and compression, which can significantly impact system performance. Therefore, based on the code context and the developer's information, the 'compressionQuality' configuration is classified as performance-sensitive."
