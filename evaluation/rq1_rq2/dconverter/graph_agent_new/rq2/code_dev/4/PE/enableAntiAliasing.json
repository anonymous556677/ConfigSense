    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'enableAntiAliasing' is performance-sensitive. Enabling anti-aliasing on scaled images involves applying a filter that can significantly impact the visual quality of the images. This operation is time-expensive and memory-expensive, as it requires additional processing to smooth out the edges of the images. This can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, especially when dealing with a large number of images or when processing high-resolution images. Therefore, the configuration directly and substantially affects system performance, making it performance-sensitive."
