    "Reason": "The 'dryRun' configuration option does not directly and substantially affect system performance at the system level. It is used to determine whether certain actions should be executed or not, but it does not involve any time-extensive or memory-extensive operations that lead to notable performance variations. The 'dryRun' parameter is simply used to control the execution of actions based on its boolean value, and it does not have a significant impact on system performance."
