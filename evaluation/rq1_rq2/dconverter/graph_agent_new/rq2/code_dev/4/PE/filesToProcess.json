    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'filesToProcess' configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the execution time and memory consumption of the system. The code snippet related to this configuration involves iterating over the files to process, which can be time-expensive and memory-expensive, especially if the list of files is large. The size impact of this configuration is significant as it determines the workload for the system, making it a critical factor in system performance. Therefore, any changes or optimizations to the 'filesToProcess' configuration can lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
