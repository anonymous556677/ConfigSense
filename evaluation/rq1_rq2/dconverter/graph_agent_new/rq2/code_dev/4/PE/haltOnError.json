    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'haltOnError' configuration option is performance-sensitive because when set to true, it directly affects the system's performance by halting job processing and shutting down the thread pool when an exception occurs. This can lead to a significant performance variation at the system level, impacting job completion rate and overall system efficiency. The configuration-related code snippet involving 'haltOnError' contains time-expensive operations such as canceling jobs and shutting down threads, which contribute to notable performance variations."
