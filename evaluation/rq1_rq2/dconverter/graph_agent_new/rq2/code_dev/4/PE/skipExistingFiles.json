    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'skipExistingFiles' configuration option is performance-sensitive because it directly affects the system performance at the system level. The code snippet related to this configuration involves time-expensive operations such as checking for the existence of image files and skipping them if the option is set to true. This can lead to notable performance variations as it can potentially save processing time and resources by avoiding unnecessary file saving operations for existing files. However, if there are frequent cases of existing files and the option is set to true, it may result in skipping files that actually need to be saved, impacting the output and overall performance of the system."
