    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The outputCompressionMode configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly affects the performance at the system level by determining the compression type for images being processed. The code snippet related to the configuration involves time-expensive operations such as image scaling and compression, which can lead to notable performance variations. Different compression modes impact the execution time and memory consumption, making this configuration performance-sensitive."
