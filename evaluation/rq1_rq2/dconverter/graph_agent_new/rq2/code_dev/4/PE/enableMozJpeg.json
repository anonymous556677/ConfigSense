{
    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'enableMozJpeg' is classified as performance-sensitive. This is because enabling the 'enableMozJpeg' configuration directly impacts the execution of the dconvert process by adding a MozJpegProcessor postprocessor to the list of postprocessors. The MozJpeg postprocessor involves time-expensive and memory-expensive operations related to image processing, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Enabling MozJpeg processing affects the overall performance and efficiency of the image conversion process, making it a performance-sensitive configuration."
