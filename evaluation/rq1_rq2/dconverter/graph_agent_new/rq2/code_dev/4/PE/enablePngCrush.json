    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'enablePngCrush' configuration option is performance-sensitive. Enabling PngCrush as a postprocessor for PNG files can have a notable performance impact at the system level. The code snippet related to this configuration involves adding the PngCrushProcessor as a postprocessor if the configuration is set to true, which indicates time-expensive and memory-expensive operations. The optimization of PNG files through PngCrush can lead to improved performance and reduced storage requirements, making it a performance-sensitive configuration."
