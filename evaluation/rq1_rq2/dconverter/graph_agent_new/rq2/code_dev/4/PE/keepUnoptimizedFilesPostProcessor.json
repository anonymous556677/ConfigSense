    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The 'keepUnoptimizedFilesPostProcessor' configuration option is not performance-sensitive based on the provided code context and developer's information. The configuration is a boolean option that determines whether to keep unoptimized files after processing, and it does not involve any performance-related operations that are time-expensive or memory-expensive within its related code. The configuration simply affects the behavior of file retention and does not directly and substantially impact system performance at the system level. Therefore, it is considered to have a trivial performance impact and is not classified as performance-sensitive."
