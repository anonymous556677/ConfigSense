    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'postConvertWebp' configuration option is classified as performance-sensitive. This is because enabling the WebpProcessor postprocessor during the execution of the dconvert adds additional processing workload by including the conversion of images to the WebP format. This operation involves time-expensive and memory-expensive tasks that can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The configuration directly affects system performance by introducing additional processing steps and potentially increasing resource usage, making it performance-sensitive."
