    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The 'upScalingAlgorithm' configuration option is not performance-sensitive based on the provided code context and developer information. The configuration is simply determining which scaling algorithm to use for upscaling operations in the system. The code snippet provided does not contain any performance-expensive operations related to this configuration. Additionally, the developer's understanding that the configuration is triggered only when the getScalingAlgorithm method is called with the type UPSCALING further supports the classification as not performance-sensitive."
