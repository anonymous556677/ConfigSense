    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'clearDirBeforeConvert' configuration option is classified as performance-sensitive. This is because enabling this option directly impacts the system performance by clearing out directories before the conversion process starts. In the code context, when 'clearDirBeforeConvert' is set to true, the code iterates through files and performs operations to clean out the directories, which can be time-expensive and memory-expensive. This operation can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, making it a performance-sensitive configuration."
