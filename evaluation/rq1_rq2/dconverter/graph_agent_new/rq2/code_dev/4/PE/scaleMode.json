    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'scaleMode' configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the performance of the system at the system level. The configuration involves performance-related operations related to image scaling, which can be time-expensive and memory-expensive. Depending on the value of 'args.scaleMode', different methods for calculating density buckets are called, leading to notable performance variations in the system. The frequency of triggering the 'scaleMode' configuration also depends on the number of image processing tasks, indicating its significant impact on system performance. Additionally, the 'scaleMode' configuration affects the size and quality of resulting images, further emphasizing its performance sensitivity."
