    "Reason": "The 'roundingHandler' configuration does not directly involve any performance-related operations that are time-expensive or memory-expensive within its related code. It simply sets the choiceRounding selection in the UI based on the preference store data. This configuration does not lead to notable performance variations at the system level, and its impact is limited to UI behavior rather than system performance."
