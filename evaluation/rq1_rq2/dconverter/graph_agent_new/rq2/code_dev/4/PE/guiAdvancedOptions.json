    "Reason": "The 'guiAdvancedOptions' configuration is mainly used to set various GUI elements based on the stored values, such as displaying different advanced options in the user interface. While the configuration may impact the user experience and functionality of the application, it does not involve any performance-related operations that are time-expensive or memory-expensive within its related code. Therefore, the configuration is not considered performance-sensitive as it does not lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
