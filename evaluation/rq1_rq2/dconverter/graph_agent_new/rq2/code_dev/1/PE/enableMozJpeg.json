    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'enableMozJpeg' is performance-sensitive because it directly affects the execution time and memory consumption of the system at the system level. Enabling 'enableMozJpeg' adds a MozJpegProcessor postprocessor to the list of postprocessors, which involves time-expensive and memory-expensive operations related to image processing. This can lead to notable performance variations during the execution of the dconvert process, impacting the overall system performance significantly."
