    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'compressionQuality' configuration option is performance-sensitive. This is because the quality of compression directly impacts the size of the compressed JPG images, which can affect the overall performance of the system in terms of memory consumption and execution time. The code snippet provided shows that the 'compressionQuality' value is passed as an argument to the 'compressJpeg' method, which is a time-expensive operation. Additionally, the configuration involves performance-related operations that contribute to notable performance variations at the system level when saving images with JPG compression. Therefore, the 'compressionQuality' configuration is considered performance-sensitive."
