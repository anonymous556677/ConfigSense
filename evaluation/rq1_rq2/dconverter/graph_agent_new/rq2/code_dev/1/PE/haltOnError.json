    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'haltOnError' configuration option is performance-sensitive. The configuration directly affects system performance at the system level by potentially halting the processing of jobs in the system. In the provided code context, when 'haltOnError' is set to true and an exception occurs, the current job is canceled, the thread pool is shutdown, and the 'onFinished' method is called with a boolean parameter set to true. This can lead to notable performance variations at the system level by stopping the processing of jobs, impacting the overall system performance and completion of tasks."
