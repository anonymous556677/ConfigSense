    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'scaleMode' configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly affects the image scaling process during conversion, leading to notable performance variations at the system level. The code snippet related to 'scaleMode' involves time-expensive operations such as calculating density buckets for output images based on the specified mode (DP_WIDTH, DP_HEIGHT, or FACTOR). Different scale modes can result in different output image dimensions and quality, impacting system performance significantly."
