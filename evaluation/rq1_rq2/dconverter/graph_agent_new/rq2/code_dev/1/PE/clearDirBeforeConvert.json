    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'clearDirBeforeConvert' configuration option is performance-sensitive. This is because enabling this option directly impacts the execution time and memory consumption at the system level. The code related to this configuration performs directory clearing operations before the conversion process starts, which can be time-expensive and memory-expensive depending on the number and size of files in the directories. Additionally, the configuration involves performance-related operations that significantly affect the overall performance of the system by potentially deleting existing files and impacting the outcome of the conversion process."
