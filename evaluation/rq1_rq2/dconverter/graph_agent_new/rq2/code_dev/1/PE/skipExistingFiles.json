    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'skipExistingFiles' configuration option is performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly affects the system performance by potentially skipping file saving operations, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The code context shows that when 'skipExistingFiles' is set to true, the program checks if the image file already exists and breaks out of the loop if it does, thus avoiding unnecessary file saving operations. This can have a significant impact on execution time and memory consumption, making it a performance-sensitive configuration."
