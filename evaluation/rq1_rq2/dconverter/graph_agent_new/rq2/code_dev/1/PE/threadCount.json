    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'threadCount' configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly affects the system's concurrency and performance at the system level. The thread count determines the number of threads in the ThreadPoolExecutor, impacting the system's throughput and resource usage. Higher thread counts can improve task processing speed but increase resource consumption, while lower thread counts may reduce resource usage but slow down task processing. The configuration-related code initializes the ThreadPoolExecutor with the specified thread count, which directly influences the system's performance by enabling concurrent task execution."
