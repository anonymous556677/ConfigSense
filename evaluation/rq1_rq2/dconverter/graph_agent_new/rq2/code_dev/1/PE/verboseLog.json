    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The 'verboseLog' configuration option does not directly and substantially affect system performance at the system level. While it may increase the amount of output generated during the execution of a process, it does not involve any time-expensive or memory-expensive operations within its related code that lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The developer's information also indicates that the configuration is simply used to determine whether to print detailed logs, which does not have a significant impact on performance."
