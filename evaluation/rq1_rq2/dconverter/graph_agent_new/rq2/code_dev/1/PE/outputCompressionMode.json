    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'outputCompressionMode' is performance-sensitive because it directly affects the performance of the system at the system level. The code snippet provided shows that the 'outputCompressionMode' is used to determine the compression mode for output images, which in turn affects the execution time and memory consumption during image processing tasks. Different compression modes lead to notable performance variations in terms of file size, image quality, and processing time, making this configuration performance-sensitive."
