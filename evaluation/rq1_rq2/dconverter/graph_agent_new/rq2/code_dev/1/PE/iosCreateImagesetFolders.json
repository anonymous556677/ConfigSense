    "Reason": "The configuration option iosCreateImagesetFolders does not directly involve any performance-related operations that are time-expensive or memory-expensive within its related code. The code snippets related to this configuration mainly focus on folder creation based on the option's value, which does not lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The developer's understanding also indicates that this configuration is primarily used for organizing output folders and does not have a significant impact on performance."
