    "Reason": "The 'roundingHandler' configuration option does not appear to have a significant performance impact at the system level. The code snippet related to loading the configuration mainly focuses on setting UI elements based on the values stored in the configuration. There are no performance-intensive operations or memory-expensive tasks associated with this configuration. Therefore, it is classified as not performance-sensitive."
