    "Reason": "The configuration option 'includeAndroidLdpiTvdpi' does not directly involve any performance-related operations that are time-expensive or memory-expensive within its related code. It simply determines whether to include specific density descriptors in a list based on a boolean value. The impact of this configuration is limited to the generation of the list of descriptors and does not lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
