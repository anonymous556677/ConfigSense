    "Reason": "The 'dryRun' configuration option in the provided code context does not directly contribute to notable performance variations at the system level. It is used to simulate the execution of certain tasks without actually performing them, which may impact the outcome of the tasks but does not lead to substantial performance variations. The code snippets involving 'dryRun' do not contain time-expensive or memory-expensive operations that would classify it as performance-sensitive."
