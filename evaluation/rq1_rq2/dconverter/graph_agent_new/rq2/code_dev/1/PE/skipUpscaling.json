    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'skipUpscaling' configuration option is classified as performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly affects the image processing operation by determining whether to skip upscaling images. Upscaling images can be a time-expensive operation, and skipping it can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The code snippet related to 'skipUpscaling' shows that it influences the processing flow and can impact the execution time and output quality of the images, making it a performance-sensitive configuration."
