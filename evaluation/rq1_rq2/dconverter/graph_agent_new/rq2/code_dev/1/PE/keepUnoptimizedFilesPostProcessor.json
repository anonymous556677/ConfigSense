    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'keepUnoptimizedFilesPostProcessor' is not performance-sensitive based on the provided code context and developer's information. The configuration is a boolean option that determines whether to keep unoptimized files after processing, which does not involve any time-expensive or memory-expensive operations. It directly impacts storage space usage but does not lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Therefore, it is classified as not performance-sensitive."
