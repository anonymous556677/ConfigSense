    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'enableAntiAliasing' configuration option is performance-sensitive. Enabling this configuration triggers the application of anti-aliasing to the scaled images, which involves additional filtering operations on the images. This filtering operation can be time-expensive and memory-expensive, leading to notable performance variations at the system level. The configuration directly impacts system performance by affecting the processing time and resource usage during image scaling, making it performance-sensitive."
