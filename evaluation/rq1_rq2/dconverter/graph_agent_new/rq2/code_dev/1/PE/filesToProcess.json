    "Reason": "The 'filesToProcess' configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly affects the system's performance at the system level. The code snippet provided shows that the 'filesToProcess' configuration is used to iterate over a list of files and perform processing tasks on them. The size of the list of files to process impacts the processing time and resource utilization of the system, making it a performance-sensitive configuration."
