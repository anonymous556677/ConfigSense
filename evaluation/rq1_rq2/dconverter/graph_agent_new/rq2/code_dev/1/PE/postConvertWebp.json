    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'postConvertWebp' configuration option is considered performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the image conversion process by adding the WebpProcessor postprocessor to the list of postprocessors. This operation involves time-expensive and memory-expensive tasks related to image processing, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Enabling this configuration option triggers the conversion of images to the WebP format, which can have a significant impact on system performance, especially if the 'cwebp' tool is accessible and used for the conversion process."
