    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'enablePngCrush' is performance-sensitive. Enabling 'enablePngCrush' adds the PngCrush post-processor to the list of post-processors, which will process the output files. This additional processing step can have a notable impact on system performance, especially if the 'pngcrush' tool is not easily accessible or efficient. The configuration directly affects the execution time and memory consumption at the system level by introducing time-expensive and memory-expensive operations related to image processing."
