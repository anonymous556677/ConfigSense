    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'enableAntiAliasing' is performance-sensitive. Enabling anti-aliasing involves applying the OP_ANTIALIAS filter to the scaled image, which is a time-expensive operation. This additional filtering operation directly impacts the system performance at the system level by increasing processing time and resource usage. Therefore, the configuration is considered performance-sensitive as it leads to notable performance variations."
