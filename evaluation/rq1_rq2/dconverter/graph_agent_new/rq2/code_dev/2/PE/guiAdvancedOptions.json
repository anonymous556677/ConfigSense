    "Reason": "The 'guiAdvancedOptions' configuration option is not performance-sensitive based on the provided code context and developer information. The code snippet primarily deals with loading preferences and setting GUI elements based on those preferences. There are no performance-related operations that are time-expensive or memory-expensive within the code. The configuration mainly impacts the GUI behavior and user interaction, which does not lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
