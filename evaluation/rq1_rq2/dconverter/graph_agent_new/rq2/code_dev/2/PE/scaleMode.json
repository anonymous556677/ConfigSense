    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'scaleMode' configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly affects the image scaling process, which can have a significant impact on the execution time and memory consumption of the system. The code related to the 'scaleMode' configuration involves operations that determine how images are scaled based on the specified scale mode, which can be time-expensive and memory-expensive. Different scale modes can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, making this configuration performance-sensitive."
