    "Reason": "The 'includeAndroidLdpiTvdpi' configuration option is not performance-sensitive based on the provided code context and developer information. The configuration simply determines whether to include ldpi and tvdpi descriptors in the list of AndroidDensityDescriptors, which does not involve any time-expensive or memory-expensive operations. The configuration does not directly and substantially affect system performance at the system level, and its impact is limited to the generation of a specific list based on the configuration setting."
