    "Reason": "The 'skipExistingFiles' configuration option does not directly and substantially affect system performance at the system level. While it may impact the execution flow within the 'saveToFile' method by potentially skipping file saving operations, it does not lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The configuration is more focused on logic flow control rather than performance-intensive operations."
