    "Reason": "The 'verboseLog' configuration option does not directly and substantially affect system performance at the system level. It mainly controls the amount of log information printed to the console, which has minimal impact on performance. The code snippet related to the 'verboseLog' configuration does not contain any time-expensive or memory-expensive operations that would lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
