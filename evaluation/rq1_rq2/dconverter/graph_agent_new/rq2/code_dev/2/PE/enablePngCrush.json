    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'enablePngCrush' is performance-sensitive. Enabling this configuration directly impacts the system performance by adding the PngCrush postprocessor to the list of postprocessors in the image conversion process. PngCrush optimization is a time-expensive operation that can significantly affect the execution time and memory consumption during image conversion. This operation leads to notable performance variations at the system level, making the configuration performance-sensitive."
