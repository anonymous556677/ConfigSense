    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'haltOnError' configuration option is performance-sensitive because it directly affects system performance at the system level. When 'haltOnError' is set to true, it triggers the cancellation of the system, shutdown of the thread pool, and the triggering of the callback with the error flag set to true. This operation is time-expensive and memory-expensive as it can potentially halt the system and impact the processing and completion of jobs, leading to notable performance variations at the system level."
