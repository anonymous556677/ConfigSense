    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'filesToProcess' configuration option is performance-sensitive. This is because the size of the 'filesToProcess' list directly impacts the number of conversion and post-processing jobs that will be executed, leading to notable performance variations at the system level. The code iterates over the 'filesToProcess' list multiple times, triggering various time-expensive and memory-expensive operations such as cleaning folders, adding converters, and running post-processors. The significant impact on system performance is evident from the extensive processing and resource utilization involved in handling the files specified in 'filesToProcess'."
