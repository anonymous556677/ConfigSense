    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The 'keepUnoptimizedFilesPostProcessor' configuration option is not performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration is a boolean option that simply determines whether to keep unoptimized files after processing. It does not involve any performance-related operations that are time-expensive or memory-expensive within its related code. The configuration directly affects the behavior of file processing logic and storage space usage, but it does not lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
