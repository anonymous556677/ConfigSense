    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The 'roundingHandler' configuration does not involve any performance-related operations that are time-expensive or memory-expensive within its related code. It is primarily used to set the choiceRounding selection in the UI based on the stored value. This configuration does not directly and substantially affect system performance at the system level, and it does not lead to notable performance variations. Therefore, it is classified as not performance-sensitive."
