    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'upScalingAlgorithm' configuration is performance-sensitive. This is because the choice of scaling algorithm directly impacts the quality and performance of image scaling operations in the application. The code snippet provided shows that the configuration is used to determine which scaling algorithm to use based on the type provided. The selection of the scaling algorithm can have a notable performance variation at the system level, especially during image processing tasks. Therefore, the 'upScalingAlgorithm' configuration is considered performance-sensitive."
