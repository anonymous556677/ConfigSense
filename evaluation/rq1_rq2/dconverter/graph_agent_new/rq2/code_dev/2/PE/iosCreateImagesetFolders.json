    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'iosCreateImagesetFolders' does not directly involve any performance-related operations that are time-expensive or memory-expensive within its related code. It simply determines whether to create an imageset folder for iOS or not based on a boolean value. The code snippets related to this configuration do not show any significant performance impact at the system level. Therefore, it is classified as not performance-sensitive."
