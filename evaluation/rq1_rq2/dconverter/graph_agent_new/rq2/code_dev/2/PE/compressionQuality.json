    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'compressionQuality' is performance-sensitive because it directly affects the quality of compression for images being saved to files, specifically when the compression type is JPG. This configuration involves performance-related operations such as compressing images with different quality settings, which can be time-expensive and memory-expensive. The quality of compression directly impacts the file size of the saved images, leading to notable performance variations at the system level. Therefore, the 'compressionQuality' configuration is considered performance-sensitive."
