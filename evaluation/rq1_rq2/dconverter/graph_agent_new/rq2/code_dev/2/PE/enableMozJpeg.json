    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'enableMozJpeg' configuration option is performance-sensitive because it directly affects the execution of the dconvert process by adding the MozJpeg postprocessor to the list of postprocessors. This postprocessor involves image processing operations that can be time-expensive and memory-expensive, leading to notable performance variations at the system level. Additionally, enabling the 'enableMozJpeg' option triggers the inclusion of the MozJpeg postprocessor, impacting the overall processing pipeline and potentially requiring additional system resources and dependencies."
