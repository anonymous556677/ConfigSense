    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'threadCount' configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly affects the number of threads available for processing tasks concurrently in the ThreadPoolExecutor. This can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, as setting a higher thread count can potentially improve performance by allowing more tasks to be executed simultaneously. However, it can also increase resource consumption and potentially lead to contention and overhead, which can have a significant impact on system performance. Therefore, the 'threadCount' configuration is considered performance-sensitive based on its direct and substantial impact on system performance."
