    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option clearDirBeforeConvert is performance-sensitive. This is because when set to true, it triggers the clearing out of directories before the file conversion process starts. This operation involves time-expensive and memory-expensive tasks within the related code, such as iterating over files and checking their existence, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The operation directly and substantially affects system performance by impacting the file processing speed and efficiency, making it performance-sensitive."
