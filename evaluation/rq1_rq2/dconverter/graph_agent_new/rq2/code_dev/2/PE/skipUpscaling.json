    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The 'skipUpscaling' configuration option is not performance-sensitive based on the provided code context and developer information. The configuration is a boolean option that determines whether to skip upscaling images during image processing. While skipping upscaling may impact the quality and size of processed images, it does not directly and substantially affect system performance at the system level. The code related to this configuration does not involve any time-expensive or memory-expensive operations that would lead to notable performance variations. Therefore, the 'skipUpscaling' configuration is not considered performance-sensitive."
