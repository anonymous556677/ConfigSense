    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'dryRun' configuration option is performance-sensitive because it directly affects the execution of resource-intensive operations in the code. Depending on the value of 'dryRun', certain operations are either skipped or executed, leading to notable performance variations at the system level. The 'dryRun' parameter is checked multiple times in the code, and its impact on system performance is significant as it determines the execution of time-expensive and memory-expensive operations."
