    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'outputCompressionMode' is performance-sensitive. This is because the 'outputCompressionMode' directly impacts the execution time and memory consumption of the system-level operations related to image processing. The code snippet provided shows that the 'outputCompressionMode' is used to determine the compression type for output images, which can significantly affect the size and quality of the images. Different compression modes lead to varying file sizes and image quality, resulting in notable performance variations at the system level during image processing tasks. Therefore, the configuration is considered performance-sensitive."
