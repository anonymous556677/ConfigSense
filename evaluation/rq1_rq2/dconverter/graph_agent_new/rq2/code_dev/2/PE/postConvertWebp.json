    "Reason": "The 'postConvertWebp' configuration option is classified as performance-sensitive. Enabling this configuration directly affects the image conversion process by adding the WebpProcessor postprocessor to the list of postprocessors. This addition introduces additional processing steps that can impact the overall execution time and memory consumption of the system. The code snippet related to this configuration shows that enabling 'postConvertWebp' triggers the creation of new WorkerHandlers and the execution of postprocessing tasks, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
