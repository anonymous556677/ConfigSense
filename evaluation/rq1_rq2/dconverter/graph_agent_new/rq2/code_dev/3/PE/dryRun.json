    "Reason": "The 'dryRun' configuration option does not directly and substantially affect system performance at the system level. It is used to skip certain file creation and processing steps based on a boolean value, which does not lead to notable performance variations. The configuration-related code shows that when 'dryRun' is true, certain actions are skipped, but this does not have a significant impact on overall system performance."
