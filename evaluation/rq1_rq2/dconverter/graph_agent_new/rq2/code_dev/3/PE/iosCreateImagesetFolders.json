    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The 'iosCreateImagesetFolders' configuration option is not performance-sensitive based on the provided code context and developer information. The configuration involves creating additional imageset folders for iOS images, which may impact the file structure but does not directly contribute to notable performance variations at the system level. The code snippets related to this configuration do not contain any time-expensive or memory-expensive operations that would significantly affect system performance. Therefore, the configuration is classified as not performance-sensitive."
