    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'filesToProcess' configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly affects the system performance at the system level. The code snippet related to the 'filesToProcess' configuration involves iterating over a list of files and performing various operations on them, such as deleting folders or adding them to a processing queue. These operations contribute to execution time and memory consumption, leading to notable performance variations at the system level. Additionally, the size impact of the 'filesToProcess' configuration on the system is significant, as it determines the number of files processed and the operations performed, further emphasizing its performance sensitivity."
