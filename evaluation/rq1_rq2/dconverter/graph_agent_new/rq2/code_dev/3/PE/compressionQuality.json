    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'compressionQuality' configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly affects the execution time and memory consumption of the system. In the provided code context, the configuration is used to determine the quality of compression for images being saved to files, specifically when the compression type is JPG. The quality of compression impacts the file size of the saved images, which in turn affects the performance of the system in terms of processing and storing these images. Higher compression quality leads to larger file sizes and potentially longer processing times, while lower compression quality reduces file size but may impact image quality. Therefore, the 'compressionQuality' configuration directly influences system performance at the system level by affecting the time-expensive and memory-expensive operations related to image compression and storage."
