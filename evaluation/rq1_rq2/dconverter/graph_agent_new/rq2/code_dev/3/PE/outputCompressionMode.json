    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The outputCompressionMode configuration is performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly affects the compression mode for the output images during image processing tasks. The code snippet related to the configuration involves time-expensive operations such as scaling images and compressing them based on the selected compression mode. These operations can have a notable performance impact at the system level, especially when processing multiple images with different compression settings. Therefore, the configuration is considered performance-sensitive."
