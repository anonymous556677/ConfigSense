    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'postConvertWebp' configuration option is classified as performance-sensitive. This is because when the option is enabled, it triggers the addition of the WebpProcessor postprocessor to the list of postprocessors. The WebpProcessor postprocessor involves time-expensive and memory-expensive operations related to image conversion, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The use of the WebpProcessor directly impacts the execution time and memory consumption during the conversion process, making it a performance-sensitive configuration."
