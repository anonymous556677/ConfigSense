    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'threadCount' configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly affects the number of threads used in the ThreadPoolExecutor, which can have a significant impact on system performance. Setting a higher thread count can potentially improve performance by allowing more tasks to be processed simultaneously, but it can also increase resource consumption and potentially lead to contention issues. The code snippet shows that the 'threadCount' configuration is used to initialize the ThreadPoolExecutor with the specified number of threads, which directly influences the concurrency and execution speed of tasks. Therefore, any changes to the 'threadCount' configuration can lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
