    "Reason": "The 'keepUnoptimizedFilesPostProcessor' configuration option is not performance-sensitive based on the provided code context and developer information. The configuration only determines whether to keep unoptimized files after processing, which does not involve any time-expensive or memory-expensive operations that would lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The configuration simply sets a checkbox in the loadPrefs() method based on the value stored in the Arguments object, and it does not directly and substantially affect system performance."
