    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'clearDirBeforeConvert' is classified as performance-sensitive. This is because setting this option to true triggers the code to clear out directories before starting the conversion process. This operation involves potentially deleting existing files in the directories, which can have a significant impact on system performance at the system level. The code related to this configuration performs time-expensive and memory-expensive operations, such as checking for file existence and deletion, which can lead to notable performance variations during the conversion process."
