    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The 'skipUpscaling' configuration option does not directly and substantially affect system performance at the system level. While it may impact the image processing operation by skipping upscaling, the performance impact is not significant enough to cause notable performance variations. The code related to setting the 'cbSkipUpscaling' checkbox does not involve any time-expensive or memory-expensive operations that would classify this configuration as performance-sensitive."
