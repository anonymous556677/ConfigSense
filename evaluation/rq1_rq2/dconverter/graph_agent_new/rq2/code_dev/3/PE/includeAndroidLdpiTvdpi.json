    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'includeAndroidLdpiTvdpi' does not directly and substantially affect system performance at the system level. Although it impacts the list of AndroidDensityDescriptor objects returned by the 'getAndroidDensityDescriptors' method, the addition of ldpi and tvdpi descriptors does not involve any time-expensive or memory-expensive operations that would lead to notable performance variations. Therefore, the configuration is not considered performance-sensitive."
