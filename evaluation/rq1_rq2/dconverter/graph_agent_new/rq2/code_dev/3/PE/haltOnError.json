    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'haltOnError' configuration option is classified as performance-sensitive. This is because when 'haltOnError' is set to true, it directly impacts the system performance by canceling the system, shutting down the thread pool, and triggering the callback with an indication of an error. These operations are time-expensive and memory-expensive within the related code context, leading to notable performance variations at the system level. The configuration's impact on system performance is substantial, making it performance-sensitive."
