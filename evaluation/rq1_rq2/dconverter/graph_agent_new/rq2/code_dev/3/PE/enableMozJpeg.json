    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'enableMozJpeg' configuration is performance-sensitive. This is because enabling the 'enableMozJpeg' option directly affects the image processing performance at the system level by adding the MozJpegProcessor to the list of postprocessors. The code snippet related to this configuration involves time-expensive operations such as image processing and compression, which can lead to notable performance variations. Additionally, the impact of enabling MozJpeg processing on the system size is significant, as it can result in smaller file sizes and faster loading times for web applications."
