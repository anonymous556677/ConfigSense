    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'scaleMode' configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly affects how the density buckets are calculated for output images, which in turn impacts the overall performance of the image conversion process. The 'scaleMode' configuration involves performance-related operations such as determining the scaling factor based on the input image dimensions and the specified scale mode (DP_WIDTH, DP_HEIGHT, or FACTOR). These operations are time-expensive and memory-expensive as they involve calculations and processing of image dimensions, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level during image conversion. Therefore, the 'scaleMode' configuration is considered performance-sensitive."
