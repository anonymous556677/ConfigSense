    "Reason": "The 'guiAdvancedOptions' configuration option is not performance-sensitive based on the provided code context and developer information. The configuration is mainly used to set various GUI elements in the application based on the values stored in the configuration. It does not involve any performance-related operations that are time-expensive or memory-expensive within its related code. The impact of this configuration is limited to the user interface of the application and does not directly affect system performance at the system level."
