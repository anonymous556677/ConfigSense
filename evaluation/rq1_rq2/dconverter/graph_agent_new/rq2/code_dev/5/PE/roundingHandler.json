    "Reason": "The 'roundingHandler' configuration option does not directly involve any performance-related operations that are time-expensive or memory-expensive within its related code. The code snippet provided shows that the 'roundingHandler' configuration is simply loaded from the preference store and set in the UI selector. It does not lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Therefore, based on the code context and developer's information, the configuration is not performance-sensitive."
