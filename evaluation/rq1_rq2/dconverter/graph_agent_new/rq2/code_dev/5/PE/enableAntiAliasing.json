{
    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'enableAntiAliasing' is performance-sensitive. Enabling anti-aliasing involves applying the OP_ANTIALIAS filter to the scaled image, which is a time-expensive operation. This operation directly affects the system performance by increasing processing time and resource usage. Since anti-aliasing can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, the configuration is classified as performance-sensitive."
