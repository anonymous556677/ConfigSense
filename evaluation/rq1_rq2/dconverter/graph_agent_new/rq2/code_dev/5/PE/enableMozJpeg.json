    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'enableMozJpeg' is performance-sensitive because it directly affects the execution time and memory consumption at the system level. When 'enableMozJpeg' is set to true, it adds the MozJpegProcessor postprocessor to the list of postprocessors used during image conversion, which can significantly impact the processing time and memory usage. This additional processing step can lead to notable performance variations in the system, making the configuration performance-sensitive."
