    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'compressionQuality' configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the execution time and memory consumption of the system. The configuration is used in the 'compressJpeg' method, which is called when saving images with JPG compression. The quality of compression set by 'compressionQuality' affects the file size and image quality, leading to notable performance variations at the system level. Higher compression quality values result in larger file sizes and potentially longer execution times, while lower values may reduce file sizes but could impact image quality. Therefore, the 'compressionQuality' configuration is considered performance-sensitive due to its significant influence on system performance."
