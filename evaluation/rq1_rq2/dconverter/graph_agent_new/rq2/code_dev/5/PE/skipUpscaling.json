    "Reason": "The 'skipUpscaling' configuration option does not directly involve any performance-related operations that are time-expensive or memory-expensive within its related code. The code snippet provided shows that the configuration is used to set the value of a checkbox in the user interface based on user preferences. While the option may impact the processing time and output quality of the application, it does not lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Therefore, it is classified as not performance-sensitive."
