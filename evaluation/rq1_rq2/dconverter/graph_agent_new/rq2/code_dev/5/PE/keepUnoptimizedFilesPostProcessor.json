    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'keepUnoptimizedFilesPostProcessor' is not performance-sensitive based on the provided code context and developer information. The configuration is a boolean option that determines whether to keep unoptimized files after processing, and it is only used to set the value of 'cbKeepUnoptimized' in the 'loadPrefs' method. This configuration does not involve any performance-related operations that are time-expensive or memory-expensive within its related code. Additionally, the developer's understanding indicates that the configuration is triggered when loading preferences and does not directly and substantially affect system performance at the system level. Therefore, it does not lead to notable performance variations and should be classified as not performance-sensitive."
