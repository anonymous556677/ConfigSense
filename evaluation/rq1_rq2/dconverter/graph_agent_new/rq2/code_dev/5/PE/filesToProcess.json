    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'filesToProcess' configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the number of conversion and post-processing jobs that will be executed, leading to notable performance variations at the system level. The code snippet related to 'filesToProcess' involves iterating through the files to be processed, checking for their existence, and adding them to the processing queue. This operation is time-expensive and memory-expensive, especially when dealing with a large number of files, which can significantly affect system performance."
