    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'postConvertWebp' configuration option is classified as performance-sensitive. This is because enabling this configuration directly impacts the image conversion process by adding a WebpProcessor postprocessor, which can significantly affect the output image quality, file size, and overall performance. The code related to this configuration involves adding the postprocessor based on the value of 'args.postConvertWebp', which indicates a direct and substantial impact on system performance at the image processing level."
