    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The 'dryRun' configuration option does not directly and substantially affect system performance at the system level. It is used to control whether certain actions are executed or not based on a condition. The 'dryRun' option is primarily used for simulation purposes and does not involve any time-expensive or memory-expensive operations within its related code. Therefore, it is classified as not performance-sensitive."
