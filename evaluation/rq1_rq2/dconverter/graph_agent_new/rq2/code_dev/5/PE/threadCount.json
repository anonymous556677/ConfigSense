    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'threadCount' configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the system's performance at the system level. The 'threadCount' value determines the number of threads used in the ThreadPoolExecutor, affecting the concurrency and processing speed of tasks. A higher 'threadCount' can lead to notable performance variations by increasing processing speed but also consuming more system resources, making it a performance-sensitive configuration."
