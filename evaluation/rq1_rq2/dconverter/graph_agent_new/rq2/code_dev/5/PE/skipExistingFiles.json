    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'skipExistingFiles' configuration option is performance-sensitive. This is because when set to true, it directly affects the system performance by potentially skipping the saving of image files, which can save processing time and resources. The code context shows that if the configuration is true and an image file already exists, the code will break out of the loop and not save the image file, thus avoiding unnecessary file saving operations. This can lead to notable performance variations at the system level by reducing the execution time and memory consumption."
