    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'scaleMode' configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly affects the calculation of density buckets for output images based on the specified scale mode (DP_WIDTH, DP_HEIGHT, or FACTOR). This calculation involves time-expensive operations such as adjusting dimensions and scaling factors, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level during image conversion tasks. The configuration-related code contains operations that contribute significantly to execution time and memory consumption, making it a performance-sensitive configuration."
