    "Reason": "The 'verboseLog' configuration option does not directly and substantially affect system performance at the system level. While it may increase the amount of output printed to the console, the impact on performance is not significant enough to cause notable performance variations. The code snippet related to the 'verboseLog' configuration does involve some performance-related operations, such as printing logs to the console, but these operations are not time-extensive or memory-extensive enough to classify the configuration as performance-sensitive."
