    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option clearDirBeforeConvert is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the execution time and memory consumption at the system level. Enabling this option triggers the cleaning of directories before the conversion process, which involves time-expensive and memory-expensive operations such as iterating through converters and deleting existing files. This can lead to notable performance variations, especially when dealing with a large number of files and converters, making it a performance-sensitive configuration."
