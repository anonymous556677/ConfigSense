    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'downScalingAlgorithm' configuration option is classified as performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the choice of scaling algorithm directly impacts the quality and performance of the scaling process in the system. The 'getScalingAlgorithm' method is called whenever the configuration is triggered, and the selection of the downScalingAlgorithm can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, making it a critical factor in system performance."
