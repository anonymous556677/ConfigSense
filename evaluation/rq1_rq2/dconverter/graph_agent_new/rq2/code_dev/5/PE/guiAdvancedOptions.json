    "Reason": "The 'guiAdvancedOptions' configuration option is not performance-sensitive. The code snippet provided mainly deals with loading preferences and setting GUI components based on those preferences. While the configuration may impact the user interface and behavior of the application, it does not involve any performance-related operations that are time-expensive or memory-expensive. The configuration settings like compression mode, thread count, scaling algorithms, etc., do not directly and substantially affect system performance at the system level, and therefore do not lead to notable performance variations."
