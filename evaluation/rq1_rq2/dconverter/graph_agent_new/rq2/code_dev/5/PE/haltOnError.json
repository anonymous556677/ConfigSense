    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'haltOnError' configuration option is performance-sensitive. This is because when the 'haltOnError' option is enabled, it directly affects the system performance by canceling the system, shutting down the thread pool, and triggering the callback with a true flag indicating an error condition. These operations are time-expensive and can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The configuration-related code snippet involving the 'haltOnError' check directly impacts the system's behavior and can significantly affect the overall system performance, making it performance-sensitive."
