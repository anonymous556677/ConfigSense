    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The outputCompressionMode configuration is classified as performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly influences the compression mode used for image processing and file saving operations, which are time-expensive and memory-expensive operations. The choice of compression mode can significantly impact the performance of the system by affecting the size and quality of the compressed images. The configuration is directly involved in operations that lead to notable performance variations at the system level, making it performance-sensitive."
