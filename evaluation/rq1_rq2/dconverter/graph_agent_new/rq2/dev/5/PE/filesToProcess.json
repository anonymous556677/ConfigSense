    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'filesToProcess' configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts system performance at the system level. The size of the list of files specified in this configuration affects the number of conversion and post-processing jobs that will be executed, leading to notable performance variations in terms of execution time and memory consumption. Additionally, the configuration is accessed in multiple parts of the code to iterate over the list of files, indicating that it involves time-expensive operations that contribute to significant performance impact."
