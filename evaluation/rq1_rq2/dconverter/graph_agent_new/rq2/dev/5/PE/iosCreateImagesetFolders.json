    "Reason": "The iosCreateImagesetFolders configuration option does not directly and substantially affect system performance at the system level. While it may impact the folder structure and organization of output files, it does not involve any time-expensive or memory-expensive operations within its related code that lead to notable performance variations. The configuration simply determines whether to create an imageset folder for iOS or use a default folder structure, which does not have a significant performance impact."
