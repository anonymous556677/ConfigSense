    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'haltOnError' configuration option is performance-sensitive because it directly and substantially affects system performance at the system level. When 'haltOnError' is set to true, it can halt the entire job execution process, shut down the thread pool, and trigger callbacks with an indication of error. This operation is time-expensive and memory-expensive within its related code, leading to notable performance variations at the system level. Therefore, the configuration is considered performance-sensitive."
