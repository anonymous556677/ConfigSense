    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The 'roundingHandler' configuration does not directly and substantially affect system performance at the system level. Although it impacts the behavior of the application by determining how rounding of numbers is handled in certain calculations, the choice made in this configuration is unlikely to cause notable performance variations. The configuration is triggered when the 'loadPrefs' method is called, which is not a time-expensive or memory-expensive operation. Therefore, based on the provided information and code context, the 'roundingHandler' configuration is not considered performance-sensitive."
