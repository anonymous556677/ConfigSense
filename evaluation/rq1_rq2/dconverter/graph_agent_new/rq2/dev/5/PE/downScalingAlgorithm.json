    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'downScalingAlgorithm' configuration is performance-sensitive because the choice of scaling algorithm directly impacts the performance of image processing operations in the system. Different algorithms can have varying effects on processing speed and resource consumption, leading to notable performance variations at the system level. The configuration is triggered frequently whenever image downscaling operations are performed, and the choice of algorithm can significantly affect the quality and efficiency of image processing. Therefore, the 'downScalingAlgorithm' configuration is considered performance-sensitive based on its direct and substantial impact on system performance."
