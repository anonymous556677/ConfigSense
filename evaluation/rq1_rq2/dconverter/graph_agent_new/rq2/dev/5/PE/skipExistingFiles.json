    "Reason": "The 'skipExistingFiles' configuration option is not performance-sensitive. The developer's explanation indicates that this configuration is used to skip existing files during the file saving process, which can potentially save processing time and resources by avoiding unnecessary file writes. While this may have a minor impact on performance by reducing unnecessary operations, it does not directly and substantially affect system performance at the system level. Additionally, the code snippet provided does not show any time-expensive or memory-expensive operations related to this configuration that would lead to notable performance variations."
