    "Reason": "The configuration option clearDirBeforeConvert does not directly and substantially affect system performance at the system level. The developer's information indicates that this option is used to determine whether to clear out directories before converting, which may impact the behavior of the conversion process but does not lead to notable performance variations. Additionally, the triggering frequency and size impact of this configuration do not suggest that it involves time-extensive or memory-extensive operations that would significantly impact performance."
