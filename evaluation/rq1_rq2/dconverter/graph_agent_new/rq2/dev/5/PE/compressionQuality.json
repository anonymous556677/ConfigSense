    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'compressionQuality' configuration option is considered performance-sensitive. This is because the quality of compression directly impacts the file size of saved images, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Higher compression quality results in larger file sizes, which can increase memory consumption and potentially slow down image processing operations. Additionally, the code snippet related to this configuration likely involves time-expensive operations for compressing images with different quality settings, further contributing to performance sensitivity."
