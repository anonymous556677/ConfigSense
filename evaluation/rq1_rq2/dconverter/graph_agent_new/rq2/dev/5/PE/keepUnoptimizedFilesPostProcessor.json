    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The 'keepUnoptimizedFilesPostProcessor' configuration option does not directly and substantially affect system performance at the system level. It mainly impacts file management behavior and storage space usage, which are not considered time-expensive or memory-expensive operations. The configuration is triggered when preferences are loaded, but it does not lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Therefore, it is classified as not performance-sensitive."
