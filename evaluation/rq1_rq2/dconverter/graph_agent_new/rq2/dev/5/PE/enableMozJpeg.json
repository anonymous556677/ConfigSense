    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'enableMozJpeg' does not directly and substantially affect system performance at the system level. Although it adds the MozJpeg postprocessor to the list of postprocessors, the impact on processing time and resource usage is not significant enough to cause notable performance variations. The developer's information indicates that enabling this option can improve image processing quality, but it does not lead to time-expensive or memory-expensive operations that would classify it as performance-sensitive."
