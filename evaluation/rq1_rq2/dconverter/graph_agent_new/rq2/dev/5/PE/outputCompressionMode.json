    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The outputCompressionMode configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly affects the quality and size of the output images, which can impact the overall performance and storage requirements of the system. The configuration involves performance-related operations related to image compression, which are time-expensive and memory-expensive. Different compression modes can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, making this configuration performance-sensitive."
