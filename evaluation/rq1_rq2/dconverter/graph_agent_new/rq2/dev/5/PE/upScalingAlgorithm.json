    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The upScalingAlgorithm configuration is considered performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the performance of image scaling operations in the application. The getScalingAlgorithm method, which is triggered by changes in the UI or when loading preferences, determines the scaling algorithm used for upscaling images. This operation is time-expensive and memory-expensive, leading to notable performance variations at the system level. Therefore, the configuration is classified as performance-sensitive."
