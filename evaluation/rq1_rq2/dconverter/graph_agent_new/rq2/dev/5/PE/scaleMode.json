    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'scaleMode' configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly affects the dimensions and quality of images during conversion, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The configuration involves performance-related operations that are time-expensive and memory-expensive within its related code, impacting the overall performance of the system. Different scale modes can result in varying output dimensions for converted images, causing significant performance impacts."
