    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The 'skipUpscaling' configuration option is not performance-sensitive based on the provided information. The developer's explanation indicates that this configuration simply determines whether to skip upscaling images during image processing. While skipping upscaling may save processing time and resources, it does not directly and substantially affect system performance at the system level. Additionally, the triggering frequency and size impact of the configuration do not suggest any notable performance variations that would classify it as performance-sensitive."
