    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'includeAndroidLdpiTvdpi' is not performance-sensitive. Although it may impact the size of the list of AndroidDensityDescriptors and potentially affect resource selection on devices with lower densities, it does not involve any time-expensive or memory-expensive operations within its related code. The configuration's impact on system performance is considered trivial and does not lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
