    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'threadCount' configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts system performance at the system level. The number of threads in the ThreadPoolExecutor created in the WorkerHandler constructor determines the concurrency level for processing tasks, which can lead to notable performance variations. Setting a higher thread count can increase parallel processing capability but may also lead to higher resource consumption, while setting a lower thread count may reduce resource usage but could result in slower task processing. Therefore, the 'threadCount' configuration involves performance-related operations that are time-expensive and memory-expensive within its related code, leading to significant performance impact at the system level."
