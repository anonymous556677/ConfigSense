    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'enableAntiAliasing' configuration is considered performance-sensitive because enabling it directly impacts system performance by applying anti-aliasing to scaled images. This operation is time-expensive and memory-expensive, leading to notable performance variations at the system level. The configuration involves performance-related operations that significantly affect execution time and resource usage, making it performance-sensitive."
