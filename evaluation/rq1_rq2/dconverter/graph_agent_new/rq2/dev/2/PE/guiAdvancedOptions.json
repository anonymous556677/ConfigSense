    "Reason": "The 'guiAdvancedOptions' configuration option does not directly and substantially affect system performance at the system level. It is mainly used to control the visibility of certain GUI elements based on user preference, which does not involve any time-expensive or memory-expensive operations. The impact of this configuration is limited to the user interface of the application, affecting the user experience but not causing notable performance variations at the system level."
