    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The 'roundingHandler' configuration does not directly involve any performance-related operations that are time-expensive or memory-expensive within its related code. The developer's explanation indicates that this configuration mainly impacts the behavior of the application in terms of number rounding, which is unlikely to cause notable performance variations at the system level. Therefore, based on the provided information and code context, the 'roundingHandler' configuration is classified as not performance-sensitive."
