    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'filesToProcess' configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts system performance at the system level. The size of the 'filesToProcess' list determines the number of files to be processed, which in turn affects the number of conversion and post-processing jobs that will be executed. This can lead to notable performance variations in terms of execution time and memory consumption. Additionally, the 'filesToProcess' configuration is iterated over in various parts of the 'execute' method, indicating that it involves time-expensive operations that contribute to performance variations."
