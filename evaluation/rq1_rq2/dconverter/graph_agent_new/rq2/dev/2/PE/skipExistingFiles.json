    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The 'skipExistingFiles' configuration option does not directly and substantially affect system performance at the system level. While it can potentially save processing time and resources by avoiding unnecessary processing of image files, it does not involve any time-extensive or memory-extensive operations within its related code that lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Therefore, it is classified as not performance-sensitive."
