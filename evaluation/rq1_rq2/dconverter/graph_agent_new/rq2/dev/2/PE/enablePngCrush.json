    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The 'enablePngCrush' configuration option does not directly and substantially affect system performance at the system level. Although it involves processing PNG files after conversion, the impact on performance is related to file size optimization rather than significant time or memory consumption. The configuration-related code context and developer's information indicate that the option is triggered based on user interface settings and adds a post-processor for optimization, which is not time-expensive or memory-expensive enough to cause notable performance variations at the system level."
