    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'keepUnoptimizedFilesPostProcessor' is not performance-sensitive based on the provided information and code context. The configuration only determines whether to keep unoptimized files after processing, which does not directly impact system performance at the system level. The triggering frequency and size impact of this configuration are related to storage space management rather than causing notable performance variations. Additionally, the configuration does not involve any time-expensive or memory-expensive operations within its related code that would lead to significant performance impacts."
