    "Reason": "The 'compressionQuality' configuration is not performance-sensitive based on the provided information. Although it impacts the size and quality of saved images, it does not directly and substantially affect system performance at the system level. The configuration is only triggered when saving images to files, and the frequency of triggering depends on the image processing workload. Additionally, the impact on performance is related to file size and image quality, rather than causing notable performance variations at the system level. Therefore, the configuration is not considered performance-sensitive."
