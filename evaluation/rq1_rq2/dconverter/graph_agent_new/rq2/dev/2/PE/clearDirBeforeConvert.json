    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option clearDirBeforeConvert is performance-sensitive. From the system level perspective, clearing directories before the conversion process can have a significant impact on system performance, especially if there are a large number of files to process. This operation can be time-expensive and memory-expensive, leading to notable performance variations. From the configuration-related code perspective, the execute method being triggered with clearDirBeforeConvert set to true indicates that this configuration directly affects the execution time and memory consumption, making it performance-sensitive."
