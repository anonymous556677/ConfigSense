    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'dryRun' configuration option is performance-sensitive. This is because the 'dryRun' configuration directly impacts the execution of time-expensive and memory-expensive operations related to file creation and processing. When 'dryRun' is true, these operations are skipped, leading to a notable performance variation at the system level by reducing resource consumption. Conversely, when 'dryRun' is false, the system performs these operations as intended, potentially consuming more system resources and causing significant performance variations."
