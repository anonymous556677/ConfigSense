    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'downScalingAlgorithm' is considered performance-sensitive because the choice of downscaling algorithm directly impacts system performance and the quality of downscaled images. Different algorithms have varying levels of computational complexity, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Additionally, the method getScalingAlgorithm likely involves performance-related operations that are time-expensive, contributing to the performance sensitivity of the configuration."
