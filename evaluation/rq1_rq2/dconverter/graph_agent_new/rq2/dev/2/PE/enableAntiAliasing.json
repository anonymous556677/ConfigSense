    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'enableAntiAliasing' is classified as performance-sensitive. This is because enabling the option triggers the application of anti-aliasing filter to scaled images, which can significantly impact processing time and resource usage. The code context indicates that this operation is time-expensive and memory-expensive, leading to notable performance variations at the system level. Therefore, the configuration directly and substantially affects system performance, making it performance-sensitive."
