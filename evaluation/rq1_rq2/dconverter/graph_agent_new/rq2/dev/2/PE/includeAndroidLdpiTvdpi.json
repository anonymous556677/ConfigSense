    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The 'includeAndroidLdpiTvdpi' configuration option is not performance-sensitive. The configuration only affects the size of the list of AndroidDensityDescriptors by adding two additional density descriptors (ldpi and tvdpi) when it is true. This increase in size is unlikely to have a notable impact on system performance at the system level. Additionally, the triggering frequency of the configuration when preferences are loaded is not time-expensive or memory-expensive, further indicating that it is not performance-sensitive."
