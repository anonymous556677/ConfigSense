    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The 'skipUpscaling' configuration option does not directly and substantially affect system performance at the system level. The developer's explanation indicates that this configuration mainly determines whether upscaling images is skipped during a specific image processing operation, which may impact processing speed and output quality but does not lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Additionally, the configuration is triggered when the loadPrefs() method is called, which typically happens during application startup or when the user accesses settings/preferences, suggesting that it does not involve time-extensive or memory-extensive operations within its related code."
