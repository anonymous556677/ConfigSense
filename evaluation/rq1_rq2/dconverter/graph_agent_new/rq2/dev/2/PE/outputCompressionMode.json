    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The outputCompressionMode configuration is considered performance-sensitive because it directly affects the size and quality of the output images, leading to notable performance variations at the system level. Different compression modes can result in different file sizes and image quality levels, which can have a significant impact on execution time and memory consumption during image processing and file saving operations. The configuration involves performance-related operations that are time-expensive and memory-expensive within its related code, making it a critical factor in determining system performance."
