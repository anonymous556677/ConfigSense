    "Reason": "The 'verboseLog' configuration option is not performance-sensitive based on the provided information. Although it may impact system performance and readability of logs if a large amount of log information is printed to the console, the triggering frequency of the configuration and its impact on system performance are not significant enough to cause notable performance variations at the system level. The configuration does not involve any time-extensive or memory-extensive operations within its related code that would lead to substantial performance impacts."
