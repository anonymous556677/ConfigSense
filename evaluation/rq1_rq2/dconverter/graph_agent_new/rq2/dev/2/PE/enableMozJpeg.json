    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'enableMozJpeg' configuration is performance-sensitive. Enabling or disabling this configuration directly impacts the quality and size of the output images, as it determines whether the efficient MozJpeg postprocessor will be used during image processing. This can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, especially when dealing with a large number of files to be processed. Additionally, the configuration involves time-expensive and memory-expensive operations within its related code, such as adding or not adding the MozJpegProcessor to the list of postprocessors based on the configuration value. Therefore, the configuration is considered performance-sensitive due to its direct and substantial effect on system performance and the presence of performance-related operations within its code."
