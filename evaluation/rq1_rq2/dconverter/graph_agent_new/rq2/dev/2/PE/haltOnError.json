    "Reason": "The 'haltOnError' configuration option is performance-sensitive because it directly and substantially affects system performance at the system level. When set to true, it can halt the processing of jobs in the system, impacting overall throughput and completion of tasks. This configuration involves time-expensive operations such as canceling the current job, shutting down the thread pool, and calling the 'onFinished' callback with the error flag set to true, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
