    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'scaleMode' configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly affects how density buckets are calculated for image conversion, leading to different output image dimensions and quality. The code snippet related to 'scaleMode' involves time-expensive operations for calculating density buckets, which can have a notable performance impact at the system level during image conversion operations."
