    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'threadCount' configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts system performance by determining the number of threads in the ThreadPoolExecutor. This configuration involves performance-related operations that are time-expensive and memory-expensive within its related code. Setting a higher thread count can increase parallelism but also consume more system resources, leading to notable performance variations at the system level. Therefore, the 'threadCount' configuration is considered performance-sensitive."
