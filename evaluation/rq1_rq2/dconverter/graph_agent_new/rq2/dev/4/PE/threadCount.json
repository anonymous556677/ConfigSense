    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'threadCount' configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts system performance by determining the concurrency level of task processing. The number of threads specified in the configuration affects the core pool size and maximum pool size of the ThreadPoolExecutor, leading to notable performance variations at the system level. Additionally, the configuration involves performance-related operations within its related code, as setting a higher thread count can increase parallelism and potentially improve performance, but also consume more system resources. Conversely, setting a lower thread count may reduce resource usage but could lead to slower task processing, highlighting the significant impact of this configuration on system performance."
