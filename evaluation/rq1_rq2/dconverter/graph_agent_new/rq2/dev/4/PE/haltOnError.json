    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'haltOnError' configuration option is performance-sensitive because it directly and substantially affects system performance at the system level. When 'haltOnError' is set to true, it can potentially stop the entire job execution, leading to notable performance variations. The code snippet checking 'haltOnError' in the 'onJobFinished' method involves time-expensive operations such as canceling the job, shutting down the thread pool, and calling a callback with an indication of error. These operations can have a significant impact on the overall progress and completion of the job, making the configuration performance-sensitive."
