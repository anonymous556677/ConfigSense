    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'compressionQuality' configuration is considered performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the file size of saved images, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Higher compression quality results in larger file sizes, potentially increasing memory consumption and slowing down image processing operations. Additionally, the code context related to the 'compressionQuality' configuration involves time-expensive operations such as image compression, which further supports its classification as performance-sensitive."
