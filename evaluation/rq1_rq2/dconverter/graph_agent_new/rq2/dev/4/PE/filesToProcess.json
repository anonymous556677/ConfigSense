    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'filesToProcess' configuration option is considered performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the system performance at the system level. The size of the list of files to process determines the number of conversion and post-processing jobs that will be executed, leading to notable performance variations in terms of execution time and resource utilization. Additionally, the 'filesToProcess' configuration is used in the 'execute' method to iterate over the list of files, which can be time-expensive and memory-expensive operations, further contributing to its performance sensitivity."
