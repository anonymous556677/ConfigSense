    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The outputCompressionMode configuration is considered performance-sensitive because it directly affects the size and quality of the output images, leading to notable performance variations at the system level. The configuration involves choosing different compression modes, which can result in varying file sizes and image quality, impacting the overall performance and storage requirements of the system. Additionally, the configuration is triggered whenever image processing tasks are executed, and the frequency of triggering depends on the number of images being processed and the compression settings specified, indicating its significant impact on performance."
