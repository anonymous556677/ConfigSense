    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The iosCreateImagesetFolders configuration option does not directly and substantially affect system performance at the system level. Although it impacts the folder structure for iOS images, the creation or non-creation of imageset folders does not lead to notable performance variations in terms of time-expensive or memory-expensive operations. The configuration mainly affects the organization and accessibility of image resources rather than causing significant performance impacts."
