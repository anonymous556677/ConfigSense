    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The 'roundingHandler' configuration does not involve any performance-related operations that are time-expensive or memory-expensive within its related code. The developer's information indicates that the configuration is mainly used to set UI elements based on loaded values and determine how rounding of numbers is handled. While the configuration may impact the behavior of the system, it does not directly and substantially affect system performance at the system level. Therefore, it is classified as not performance-sensitive."
