    "Reason": "The 'enableAntiAliasing' configuration option does not directly and substantially affect system performance at the system level. Although it may impact visual quality and require more processing power, it does not lead to notable performance variations that would classify it as performance-sensitive. The configuration is triggered when loading preferences and applies a filter to the scaled image, but these operations are not time-expensive or memory-expensive enough to significantly impact overall system performance."
