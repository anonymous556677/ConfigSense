    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The 'clearDirBeforeConvert' configuration option does not directly and substantially affect system performance at the system level. Although it involves clearing directories before conversion, this operation is not time-expensive or memory-expensive. The impact of this configuration is more related to ensuring the cleanliness of directories before conversion to avoid conflicts or issues with existing files. Therefore, it does not lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
