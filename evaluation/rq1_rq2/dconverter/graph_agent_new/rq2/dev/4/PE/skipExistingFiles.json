    "Reason": "The 'skipExistingFiles' configuration option does not directly and substantially affect system performance at the system level. While it may save processing time and resources by avoiding unnecessary file writes, the impact is not significant enough to cause notable performance variations. The developer's explanation also indicates that the configuration is mainly used to skip saving a file if it already exists, which does not involve time-extensive or memory-extensive operations that would lead to notable performance variations."
