    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'scaleMode' configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly affects the execution time and memory consumption of the system at the system level. The developer's explanation indicates that the 'scaleMode' configuration is crucial in determining how density buckets are calculated and which method to call for getting density buckets. Since the configuration impacts how images are converted and scaled, choosing different scale modes can result in notable performance variations in terms of output image dimensions and qualities. Additionally, the 'scaleMode' configuration is triggered frequently whenever the 'convert' method is called, further emphasizing its performance sensitivity."
