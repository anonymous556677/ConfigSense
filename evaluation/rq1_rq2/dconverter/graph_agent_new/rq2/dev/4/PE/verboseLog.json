    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'verboseLog' configuration option is classified as performance-sensitive. This is because when 'args.verboseLog' is true, detailed log information is printed during the execution of a process, which can lead to a significant increase in both execution time and memory consumption. The triggering frequency of the configuration also depends on the value of 'args.verboseLog', which means it can have a direct impact on system performance. Additionally, the size impact of the configuration, related to the amount of log information processed and printed, further supports its classification as performance-sensitive."
