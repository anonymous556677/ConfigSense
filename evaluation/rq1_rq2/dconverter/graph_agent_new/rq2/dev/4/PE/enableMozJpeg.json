    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'enableMozJpeg' is considered performance-sensitive. Enabling or disabling this configuration directly impacts the image processing and conversion tasks by determining whether the MozJpeg postprocessor is used. The use of the MozJpeg tool can significantly affect the processing speed and quality of the output images, leading to notable performance variations at the system level. Additionally, the code snippet related to this configuration involves adding a postprocessor to the list of postprocessors, which can contribute to execution time and memory consumption, making it a performance-sensitive configuration."
