    "Reason": "The 'keepUnoptimizedFilesPostProcessor' configuration option does not directly and substantially affect system performance at the system level. It primarily impacts storage space usage based on whether unoptimized files are kept or deleted after processing. The code context provided by the developer indicates that this configuration is mainly related to file management and does not involve any time-expensive or memory-expensive operations that would lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
