    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'scaleMode' configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly affects the image scaling and processing operations in the system, leading to notable performance variations. The 'scaleMode' configuration is used in the 'getDensityBuckets' method, which is a performance-related operation contributing to execution time and memory consumption. Different scale modes (DP_WIDTH, DP_HEIGHT, or FACTOR) can result in different output image sizes and qualities, impacting the overall performance of the image processing system at the system level."
