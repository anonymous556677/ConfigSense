    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'haltOnError' configuration option is classified as performance-sensitive. This is because when the 'haltOnError' option is set to true, it can lead to significant performance variations at the system level. The code snippet related to this configuration involves shutting down the thread pool and canceling the current job, which are time-expensive operations. This can directly impact the overall system performance and job completion rate, making it a performance-sensitive configuration."
