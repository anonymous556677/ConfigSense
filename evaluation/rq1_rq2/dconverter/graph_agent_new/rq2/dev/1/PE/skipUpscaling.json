    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The 'skipUpscaling' configuration option does not directly and substantially affect system performance at the system level. Although it may impact the image processing task by potentially skipping upscaling and resulting in faster processing, the performance impact is not significant enough to be classified as performance-sensitive. The configuration is mainly related to the quality of output images rather than causing notable performance variations."
