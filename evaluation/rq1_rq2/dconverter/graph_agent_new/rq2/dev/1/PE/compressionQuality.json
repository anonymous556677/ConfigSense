    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'compressionQuality' configuration option is performance-sensitive. This is because the value of 'compressionQuality' directly affects the file size and visual quality of compressed JPEG images, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Additionally, the 'compressJpeg' method, which uses the 'compressionQuality' configuration, is a time-expensive operation as it involves image compression, impacting system performance. Therefore, the configuration is considered performance-sensitive based on its impact on system performance and the time-expensive operation within its related code."
