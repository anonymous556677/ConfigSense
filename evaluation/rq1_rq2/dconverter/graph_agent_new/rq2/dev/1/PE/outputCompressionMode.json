    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The outputCompressionMode configuration, as described by the developer, is primarily used to specify the compression type for image processing tasks. While it may impact the size and quality of the output images, it does not directly involve any performance-sensitive operations that significantly affect system performance at the system level. The configuration is more focused on the output quality and file size trade-off rather than causing notable performance variations. Therefore, it is classified as not performance-sensitive."
