    "Reason": "The configuration option 'enableAntiAliasing' is not performance-sensitive based on the provided information. While enabling anti-aliasing may impact the system by improving visual quality of images, it is not directly and substantially affecting system performance at the system level. The additional anti-aliasing calculations may increase processing time and resource usage, but it does not lead to notable performance variations that would classify it as performance-sensitive. Additionally, the triggering frequency of the configuration when loading preferences does not indicate a significant impact on system performance."
