    "Reason": "The configuration option 'keepUnoptimizedFilesPostProcessor' is not performance-sensitive based on the provided information. The configuration is a boolean option that determines whether to keep unoptimized files after processing, which primarily affects storage space usage. While enabling this option may result in additional storage space consumption, it does not involve any time-expensive or memory-expensive operations that would lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Therefore, the configuration does not directly and substantially affect system performance in a significant way."
