    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'enableMozJpeg' configuration option is performance-sensitive. This is because enabling the option directly impacts the processing of images during the dconvert process by adding the MozJpeg postprocessor, which can significantly affect the performance and quality of image processing in the system. The addition of the postprocessor involves time-expensive and memory-expensive operations within the related code, leading to notable performance variations at the system level."
