    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'threadCount' configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the system's performance at the system level. The number of threads in the ThreadPoolExecutor significantly affects the concurrent execution of tasks, which can lead to notable performance variations. Setting the 'threadCount' too low may result in underutilization of resources, while setting it too high may cause resource contention and performance degradation. Additionally, the 'threadCount' configuration involves performance-related operations within its related code, as it is used to set the core pool size and maximum pool size of the ThreadPoolExecutor, making it time-expensive and memory-expensive."
