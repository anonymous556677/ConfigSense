    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The 'roundingHandler' configuration, as described by the developer, primarily impacts the behavior of the application related to how numbers are rounded in certain operations. While this configuration may have some impact on the application's behavior, it does not involve any performance-related operations that are time-expensive or memory-expensive. Additionally, the developer's explanation indicates that the configuration is triggered only when certain settings/preferences are accessed, which suggests that it does not directly and substantially affect system performance at the system level. Therefore, based on the provided information and analysis of the configuration-related code context, the 'roundingHandler' configuration is not classified as performance-sensitive."
