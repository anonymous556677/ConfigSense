    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'postConvertWebp' configuration option is classified as performance-sensitive because enabling or disabling this option directly impacts the processing time and resources required for the conversion process. By adding the WebpProcessor postprocessor to the list of postprocessors, it introduces additional operations that can be time-expensive and memory-expensive, especially when dealing with a large number of files. This can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, making it a performance-sensitive configuration."
