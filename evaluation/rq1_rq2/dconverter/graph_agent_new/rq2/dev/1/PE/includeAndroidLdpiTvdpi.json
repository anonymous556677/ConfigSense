    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'includeAndroidLdpiTvdpi' does not directly and substantially affect system performance at the system level. Although it impacts the list of Android density descriptors and can affect resource handling and scaling for ldpi and tvdpi screen densities, the performance impact is not significant enough to be considered performance-sensitive. The configuration does not involve any time-extensive or memory-extensive operations within its related code that would lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
