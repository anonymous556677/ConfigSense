    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The configuration option clearDirBeforeConvert is not performance-sensitive based on the provided information. Although it involves clearing out directories before starting the conversion process, this operation is not time-expensive or memory-expensive. The triggering frequency of the configuration option is dependent on the number of files and converters involved, but it does not directly and substantially affect system performance at the system level. Therefore, it does not lead to notable performance variations and should be classified as not performance-sensitive."
