    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'filesToProcess' configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts system performance at the system level. The configuration involves iterating over a list of files and performing operations on each file, which can be time-expensive depending on the number of files specified. This can lead to notable performance variations in terms of execution time and memory consumption at the system level, making it a performance-sensitive configuration."
