    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'skipExistingFiles' configuration option is performance-sensitive. From the system level perspective, this configuration directly impacts the performance by potentially saving time and resources through avoiding unnecessary file writes. In the configuration-related code, setting the option to true leads to a performance-related operation where the code checks if the file already exists and skips the saving process if it does. This operation is time-expensive and can contribute significantly to performance variations at the system level."
