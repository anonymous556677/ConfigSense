    "Reason": "The configuration 'guiAdvancedOptions' primarily impacts the user interface of the application by displaying or hiding advanced options based on its value. This configuration does not involve any performance-related operations that are time-expensive or memory-expensive within its related code. Therefore, it does not lead to notable performance variations at the system level. As a result, it is classified as not performance-sensitive."
