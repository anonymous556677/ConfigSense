    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'enablePngCrush' configuration option is considered performance-sensitive. Enabling this configuration directly impacts the system's processing flow by adding the PngCrush postprocessor to the list of postprocessors, which affects the processing of image files. This additional step of applying PngCrush optimization to image files can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, especially in terms of execution time and memory consumption. The configuration-related code snippets clearly show that enabling 'enablePngCrush' triggers significant performance-related operations that contribute to time-expensive and memory-expensive tasks, making it performance-sensitive."
