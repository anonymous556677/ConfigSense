    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The downScalingAlgorithm configuration option is performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly impacts the scaling algorithm used in the system, affecting the processing and scaling of images. The getScalingAlgorithm method, which determines the algorithm based on the type provided, is triggered whenever the type parameter is not equal to UPSCALING. This means that the configuration involves performance-related operations that are time-expensive within its related code, leading to notable performance variations at the system level."
