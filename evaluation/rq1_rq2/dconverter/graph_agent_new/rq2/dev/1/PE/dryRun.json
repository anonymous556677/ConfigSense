    "Reason": "The 'dryRun' configuration option does not directly and substantially affect system performance at the system level. It is used as a flag to simulate actions without actually performing them, which does not contribute significantly to execution time or memory consumption. While the option is triggered multiple times in the system, it does not involve any time-expensive or memory-expensive operations within its related code that would lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
