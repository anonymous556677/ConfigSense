    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'filesToProcess' configuration is considered performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the overall performance and resource utilization of the system at the system level. The size of the 'filesToProcess' list determines the number of files to be processed, which in turn affects the number of conversion and post-processing jobs that will be executed. This can lead to notable performance variations in terms of execution time and memory consumption. Additionally, the 'filesToProcess' configuration is accessed and used in various parts of the code, indicating that it involves performance-related operations that contribute significantly to the system's performance."
