    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The 'skipUpscaling' configuration option does not directly and substantially affect system performance at the system level. Although it may impact the image processing operation by skipping upscaling, this operation is not time-expensive or memory-expensive enough to cause notable performance variations at the system level. Therefore, the configuration is not considered performance-sensitive."
