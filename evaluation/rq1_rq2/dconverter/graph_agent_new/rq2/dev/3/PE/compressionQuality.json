    "Reason": "The 'compressionQuality' configuration option is not classified as performance-sensitive. Although it directly impacts the file size of saved images, the performance impact is limited to the size of the output files and does not significantly affect system performance at the system level. The configuration-related code snippet that uses 'compressionQuality' in the compressJpeg method is focused on image quality and file size, rather than time-expensive or memory-expensive operations that would lead to notable performance variations."
