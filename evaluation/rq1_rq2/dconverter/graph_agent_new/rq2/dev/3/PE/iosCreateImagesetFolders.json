    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The iosCreateImagesetFolders configuration option does not directly and substantially affect system performance at the system level. The creation of additional imageset folders for iOS images, as a result of enabling the configuration, may impact the size and structure of the output directory, but it does not lead to notable performance variations. The configuration-related code snippets that check and handle the option in the createMainSubFolder method, onPreExecute method, and clean method do not involve time-expensive or memory-expensive operations that would significantly impact performance."
