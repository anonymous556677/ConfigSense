    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'enableMozJpeg' does not directly and substantially affect system performance at the system level. The developer's information indicates that enabling 'enableMozJpeg' adds the MozJpegProcessor postprocessor to the list of postprocessors used during execution, which may improve the quality or reduce the size of output files. While this configuration may have an impact on file processing, it does not involve any time-extensive or memory-extensive operations that would lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Therefore, it is classified as not performance-sensitive."
