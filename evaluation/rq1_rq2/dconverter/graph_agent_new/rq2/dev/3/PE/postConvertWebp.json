The developer's information indicates that this configuration option simply determines whether the WebpProcessor postprocessor should be added to the list of postprocessors during the execution of the dconvert. While it may add additional processing steps if enabled, it does not involve any time-extensive or memory-extensive operations that would lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
