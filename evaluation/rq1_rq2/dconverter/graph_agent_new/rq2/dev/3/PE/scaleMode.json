    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'scaleMode' configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly affects the calculation of density buckets for image processing, which can impact the final output dimensions and quality of processed images. The different scaling modes (DP_WIDTH, DP_HEIGHT, FACTOR) in the 'getDensityBuckets' method contribute to time-expensive operations that can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Therefore, the 'scaleMode' configuration is considered performance-sensitive based on its impact on system performance and the time-expensive operations within its related code."
