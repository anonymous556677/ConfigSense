    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'threadCount' configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts system performance at the system level. The number of threads specified in 'threadCount' affects the core pool size and maximum pool size of the ThreadPoolExecutor, which in turn determines the concurrency level for task execution. A higher 'threadCount' value can lead to improved performance by allowing more tasks to be executed simultaneously, but it can also increase resource consumption and potentially introduce thread contention and overhead. Therefore, changes in the 'threadCount' configuration can result in notable performance variations at the system level."
