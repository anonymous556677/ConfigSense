    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'dryRun' configuration option is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts system performance at the system level. When 'dryRun' is set to true, resource-intensive operations are skipped, leading to notable performance variations in terms of execution time and memory consumption. This configuration option is triggered multiple times in the system and controls whether certain actions are executed or not, making it crucial for system performance."
