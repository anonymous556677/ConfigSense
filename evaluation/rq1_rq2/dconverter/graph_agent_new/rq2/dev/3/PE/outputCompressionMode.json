    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The outputCompressionMode configuration is performance-sensitive. This is because the choice of compression mode directly impacts the size and quality of the output images, which in turn affects the overall performance and storage requirements of the system. Different compression modes can result in varying levels of image compression and quality, leading to notable performance variations at the system level. Additionally, the configuration is triggered frequently during image processing tasks, indicating that it plays a crucial role in determining the performance of the system."
