    "Reason": "The 'skipExistingFiles' configuration option is performance-sensitive because it directly affects system performance at the system level. The code snippet related to this configuration involves time-expensive operations such as checking for existing image files and skipping the saving process if the file already exists. Depending on the number of images being processed and the number of existing files that need to be skipped, this configuration can lead to notable performance variations by potentially saving processing time and resources, but also impacting overall processing time if there are many existing files to skip."
