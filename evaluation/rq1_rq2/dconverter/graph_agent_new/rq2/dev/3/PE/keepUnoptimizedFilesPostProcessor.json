    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'keepUnoptimizedFilesPostProcessor' is not performance-sensitive. The developer's explanation indicates that this configuration only affects the storage space used by the application, depending on whether unoptimized files are kept or deleted after processing. There is no indication that this configuration directly and substantially impacts system performance at the system level. Additionally, the code context provided does not show any performance-related operations that are time-expensive or memory-expensive, which would lead to notable performance variations."
