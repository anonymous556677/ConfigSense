    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'downScalingAlgorithm' is considered performance-sensitive because it directly affects the scaling behavior of the system, leading to notable performance variations at the system level. The choice of algorithm can impact the quality and performance of the scaling process, potentially affecting the overall user experience. Additionally, the code context related to this configuration involves performance-related operations that contribute significantly to execution time and memory consumption, making it a critical factor in system performance."
