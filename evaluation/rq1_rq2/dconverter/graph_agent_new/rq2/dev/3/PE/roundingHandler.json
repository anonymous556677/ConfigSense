    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The roundingHandler configuration is classified as performance-sensitive because it directly affects the performance of image processing operations in the system. The configuration involves setting the choiceRounding selection in the UI based on the value stored in the configuration, which can impact the quality or performance of the image processing operations. Since image processing operations are typically time-expensive and memory-expensive, any changes in the roundingHandler configuration can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Therefore, the configuration is considered performance-sensitive."
