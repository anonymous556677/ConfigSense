    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option clearDirBeforeConvert is classified as performance-sensitive. From the system level perspective, setting clearDirBeforeConvert to true can lead to notable performance variations due to the significant impact on storage space and performance by clearing out directories before starting the conversion process. Additionally, from the configuration-related code perspective, the operation of clearing directories before conversion is time-expensive and memory-expensive, contributing to notable performance variations at the system level."
