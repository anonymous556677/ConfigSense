    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'skipExistingFiles' is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the 'skipExistingFiles' configuration directly affects the performance of the system at the system level. In the provided code context, the 'skipExistingFiles' configuration is used to check if an image file already exists before processing it. If the file exists, the program skips processing it, which can lead to notable performance variations by avoiding unnecessary processing of existing files. This configuration involves a performance-related operation that is time-expensive within its related code, making it performance-sensitive."
