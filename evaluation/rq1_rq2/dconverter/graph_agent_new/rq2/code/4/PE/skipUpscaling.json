    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'skipUpscaling' does not appear to be performance-sensitive based on the provided code context. The 'skipUpscaling' configuration is simply a checkbox setting that determines whether to skip upscaling during image processing. This setting does not involve any performance-related operations that are time-expensive or memory-expensive within the related code. Additionally, toggling this setting is unlikely to cause notable performance variations at the system level. Therefore, the configuration is classified as not performance-sensitive."
