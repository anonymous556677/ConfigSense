{
    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'compressionQuality' is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the 'compressionQuality' directly affects the performance of the system at the system level. The code snippet provided shows that the 'compressionQuality' is used in the 'compressJpeg' method, which is a time-expensive operation. The quality of compression directly impacts the execution time and memory consumption of the system, leading to notable performance variations. Therefore, the 'compressionQuality' configuration is considered performance-sensitive."
