    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'enableAntiAliasing' is performance-sensitive. The code snippet related to this configuration shows that when 'args.enableAntiAliasing' is true, the image is filtered using the 'OP_ANTIALIAS' filter. This operation can be time-expensive and memory-expensive, leading to notable performance variations at the system level. Therefore, the configuration directly and substantially affects system performance, making it performance-sensitive."
