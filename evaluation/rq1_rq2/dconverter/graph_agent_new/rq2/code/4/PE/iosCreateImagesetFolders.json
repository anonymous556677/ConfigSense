    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'iosCreateImagesetFolders' is performance-sensitive. This is because the 'iosCreateImagesetFolders' option directly affects the system performance by creating additional image set folders, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The code snippet related to this configuration shows that when 'iosCreateImagesetFolders' is true, it creates a new folder for each image set, which involves time-expensive and memory-expensive operations. These operations can have a significant impact on the overall performance of the system, making this configuration performance-sensitive."
