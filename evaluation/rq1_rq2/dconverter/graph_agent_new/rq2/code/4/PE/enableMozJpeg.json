    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'enableMozJpeg' is performance-sensitive. This is because enabling 'enableMozJpeg' involves the use of the 'MozJpegProcessor' postprocessor, which is a time-expensive operation that can significantly impact system performance. The code snippet related to 'enableMozJpeg' shows that if 'args.enableMozJpeg' is true, the 'MozJpegProcessor' postprocessor is added to the list of postprocessors, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Therefore, the configuration is considered performance-sensitive."
