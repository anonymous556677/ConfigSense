    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'keepUnoptimizedFilesPostProcessor' is performance-sensitive. The code snippet related to this configuration involves multiple performance-related operations that directly affect system performance. The configuration setting 'cbKeepUnoptimized.setSelected(args.keepUnoptimizedFilesPostProcessor)' leads to notable performance variations at the system level by determining whether unoptimized files should be kept, which can have a significant impact on memory consumption and execution time. Therefore, this configuration is considered performance-sensitive."
