    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'createMipMapInsteadOfDrawableDir' is performance-sensitive. The 'createMipMapInsteadOfDrawableDir' configuration directly affects the directory prefix used in the 'getAndroidDensityDescriptors' method, which in turn impacts the creation of different density descriptors for Android resources. This configuration can lead to notable performance variations at the system level by determining whether to use 'mipmap' or 'drawable' directories, affecting the memory consumption and execution time of the application."
