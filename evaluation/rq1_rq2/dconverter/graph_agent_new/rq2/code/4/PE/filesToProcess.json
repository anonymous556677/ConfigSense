    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'filesToProcess' is performance-sensitive. The code snippet related to 'filesToProcess' involves multiple time-expensive and memory-expensive operations such as iterating over the files, checking file existence, and creating processing queues. These operations directly impact the execution time and memory consumption at the system level, leading to notable performance variations. Additionally, the configuration option is crucial for determining the number of conversion and post-processing jobs, which further emphasizes its performance sensitivity."
