    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'includeAndroidLdpiTvdpi' is performance-sensitive. This is because the 'includeAndroidLdpiTvdpi' configuration directly affects the system performance by determining whether to include ldpi and tvdpi density descriptors, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The code snippet related to this configuration involves adding ldpi and tvdpi density descriptors to the list based on the value of 'includeAndroidLdpiTvdpi', which can be time-expensive and memory-expensive operations contributing to system performance impact."
