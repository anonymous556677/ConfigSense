    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The 'roundingHandler' configuration option does not appear to be performance-sensitive based on the provided code context. The code snippet related to 'roundingHandler' involves setting a choice selection in a GUI component based on the 'args.roundingHandler' value, which does not involve any time-expensive or memory-expensive operations. This configuration option does not directly and substantially affect system performance at the system level, and it does not lead to notable performance variations. Therefore, it is classified as not performance-sensitive."
