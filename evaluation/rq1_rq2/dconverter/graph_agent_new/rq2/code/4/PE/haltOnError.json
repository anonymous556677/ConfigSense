    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'haltOnError' is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the 'haltOnError' configuration directly affects system performance at the system level by potentially halting the execution of jobs and shutting down the thread pool. This configuration involves a performance-related operation that is time-expensive within its related code, as it can lead to notable performance variations by prematurely terminating the execution of jobs and impacting the overall system performance."
