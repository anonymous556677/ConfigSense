    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'scaleMode' is performance-sensitive. The 'scaleMode' configuration directly affects the performance of the system at the system level by determining the scaling behavior of images in the conversion process. The 'scaleMode' configuration is used in the 'getDensityBuckets' method, which calculates density buckets based on different scaling modes. Depending on the 'scaleMode' chosen, different calculations are performed, impacting the execution time and memory consumption of the conversion process. Therefore, the 'scaleMode' configuration is considered performance-sensitive as it directly influences notable performance variations at the system level."
