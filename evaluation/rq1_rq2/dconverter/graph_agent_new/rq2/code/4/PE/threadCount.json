    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'threadCount' configuration option is performance-sensitive. This is because the 'threadCount' directly affects the ThreadPoolExecutor creation in the 'WorkerHandler' constructor, which in turn impacts the execution time and memory consumption of the program. The 'threadCount' configuration is used to determine the number of threads to be used for processing tasks, and a higher thread count can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, especially when handling a large number of files for conversion. Additionally, the 'threadCount' value is referenced multiple times in the code context, indicating its importance in determining the concurrency level of the program."
