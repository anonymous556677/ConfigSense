    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'clearDirBeforeConvert' is performance-sensitive. This is because the 'clearDirBeforeConvert' option directly affects the system performance by clearing out directories before conversion, which can have a notable impact on the execution time and memory consumption at the system level. The code snippet related to this configuration shows that if 'clearDirBeforeConvert' is enabled, it triggers the cleaning of directories before conversion, which involves time-expensive and memory-expensive operations. These operations can lead to significant performance variations, making this configuration performance-sensitive."
