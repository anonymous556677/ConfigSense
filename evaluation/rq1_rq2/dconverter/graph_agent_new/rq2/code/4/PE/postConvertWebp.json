    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'postConvertWebp' is performance-sensitive. This is because enabling 'postConvertWebp' triggers the execution of the 'WebpProcessor' postprocessor, which involves time-expensive and memory-expensive operations related to converting images to WebP format. This operation directly impacts the system performance at the system level by adding additional processing overhead. Additionally, the code snippet related to handling the 'postConvertWebp' configuration option includes logic for adding the 'WebpProcessor' postprocessor to the list of postprocessors, which further confirms its performance-sensitive nature."
