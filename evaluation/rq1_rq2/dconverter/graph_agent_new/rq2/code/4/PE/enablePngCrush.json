    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'enablePngCrush' is performance-sensitive. This is because enabling 'enablePngCrush' triggers the execution of the 'PngCrushProcessor' post-processor, which involves time-expensive and memory-expensive operations related to image processing. These operations directly impact system performance at the system level by adding additional processing overhead, leading to notable performance variations. Therefore, the configuration is considered performance-sensitive based on the code context and its impact on system performance."
