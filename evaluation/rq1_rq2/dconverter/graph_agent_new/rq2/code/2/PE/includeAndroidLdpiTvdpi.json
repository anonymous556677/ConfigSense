    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option includeAndroidLdpiTvdpi is performance-sensitive. This is because the inclusion of ldpi and tvdpi densities in the AndroidDensityDescriptor list directly affects the system performance at the system level. The code snippet related to this configuration involves time-expensive operations in adding these density descriptors, which can lead to notable performance variations in the system. Therefore, the configuration is classified as performance-sensitive."
