    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'iosCreateImagesetFolders' is performance-sensitive. This is because the 'iosCreateImagesetFolders' configuration directly affects the performance of the system by creating additional folders for imagesets, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The code snippets related to this configuration involve time-expensive operations such as creating and checking folders, as well as deleting folders, which can contribute to significant execution time and memory consumption. Therefore, the 'iosCreateImagesetFolders' configuration is considered performance-sensitive based on its impact on system performance and the performance-related operations within its related code."
