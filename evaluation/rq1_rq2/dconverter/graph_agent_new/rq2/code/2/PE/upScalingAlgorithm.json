    "Reason": "The configuration option 'upScalingAlgorithm' is not performance-sensitive. The code snippet provided does not contain any performance-related operations that are time-expensive or memory-expensive. The function 'getScalingAlgorithm' simply returns a value based on the input type without any complex or resource-intensive computations. Therefore, this configuration does not lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
