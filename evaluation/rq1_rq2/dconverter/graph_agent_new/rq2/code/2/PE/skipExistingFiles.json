    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'skipExistingFiles' is performance-sensitive. This is because the 'skipExistingFiles' configuration directly affects the performance of the system at the system level. In the provided code context, the 'skipExistingFiles' configuration is used to check if an image file already exists before saving a new version of it. This check can lead to notable performance variations as it determines whether certain time-expensive operations, such as scaling and compressing images, need to be performed. Therefore, the 'skipExistingFiles' configuration has a direct and substantial impact on system performance."
