    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'createMipMapInsteadOfDrawableDir' is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the 'createMipMapInsteadOfDrawableDir' configuration directly affects the directory prefix used in the 'getAndroidDensityDescriptors' method, which in turn impacts the creation of different density descriptors for Android resources. This configuration can lead to notable performance variations at the system level by determining whether to use 'mipmap' or 'drawable' directories, affecting the loading and rendering of resources on different screen densities. Therefore, the configuration involves performance-related operations that are time-expensive and memory-expensive within its related code, making it performance-sensitive."
