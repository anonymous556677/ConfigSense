    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'enableAntiAliasing' is performance-sensitive. The code snippet related to this configuration involves a performance-related operation that is time-expensive (OP_ANTIALIAS.filter) within its related code. Enabling anti-aliasing can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, as it involves additional processing to improve image quality, which can impact execution time and memory consumption significantly."
