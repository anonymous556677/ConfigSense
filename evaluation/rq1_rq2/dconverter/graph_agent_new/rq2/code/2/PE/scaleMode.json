    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'scaleMode' is performance-sensitive. The 'scaleMode' configuration directly affects the performance of the system at the system level by determining the scaling mode for image processing operations. The code context shows that the 'scaleMode' configuration is used to select different scaling algorithms based on the 'args.scaleMode' value, which can lead to notable performance variations in terms of time-expensive and memory-expensive operations. The 'scaleMode' configuration influences the image processing workflow and can significantly impact the overall performance of the system."
