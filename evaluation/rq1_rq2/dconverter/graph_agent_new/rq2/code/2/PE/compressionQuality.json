    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'compressionQuality' is performance-sensitive. This is because the 'compressionQuality' directly affects the performance of the system at the system level by determining the quality of the compressed images. The code snippet related to 'compressionQuality' involves time-expensive operations such as compressing images using different compression algorithms based on the quality level. These operations can lead to notable performance variations, especially when dealing with large images or a high volume of image processing tasks."
