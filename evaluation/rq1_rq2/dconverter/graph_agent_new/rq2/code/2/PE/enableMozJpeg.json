    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'enableMozJpeg' is performance-sensitive. This is because enabling 'MozJpeg' involves the execution of the 'MozJpegProcessor' post-processor, which is a time-expensive operation. The code snippet related to 'enableMozJpeg' shows that enabling this option adds additional processing steps and potentially impacts the performance at the system level. The 'MozJpegProcessor' post-processor is executed if the 'enableMozJpeg' flag is set, and it checks if the 'jpegtran' tool is accessible. This additional processing step can lead to notable performance variations, making the configuration performance-sensitive."
