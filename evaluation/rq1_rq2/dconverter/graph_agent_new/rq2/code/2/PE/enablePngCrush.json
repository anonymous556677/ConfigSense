    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'enablePngCrush' is performance-sensitive. This is because enabling 'enablePngCrush' involves the use of the 'PngCrushProcessor' post-processor, which can have a notable performance impact. The code snippet related to 'enablePngCrush' shows that if 'args.enablePngCrush' is true, the 'PngCrushProcessor' is added to the list of post-processors, which can significantly affect the execution time and memory consumption at the system level. Therefore, the configuration directly and substantially affects system performance, making it performance-sensitive."
