    "Reason": "The 'roundingHandler' configuration option is not performance-sensitive. The code related to loading preferences does not contain any performance-intensive operations that would lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The 'roundingHandler' configuration itself does not involve any time-expensive or memory-expensive operations that would directly and substantially affect system performance."
