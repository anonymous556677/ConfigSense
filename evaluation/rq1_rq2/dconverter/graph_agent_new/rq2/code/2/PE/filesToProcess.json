    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'filesToProcess' configuration option is performance-sensitive. This is because the 'filesToProcess' configuration directly affects the execution time and memory consumption of the system. The code snippet related to 'filesToProcess' involves iterating over files to process, which can be time-expensive and memory-expensive operations. Additionally, the 'filesToProcess' configuration is used in multiple places within the code, impacting the overall performance of the system. Therefore, based on the code context and the operations performed with 'filesToProcess', it is classified as performance-sensitive."
