    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'postConvertWebp' is performance-sensitive. This is because enabling 'postConvertWebp' involves adding a 'WebpProcessor' postprocessor, which performs image conversion operations. These operations are time-expensive and memory-expensive, leading to notable performance variations at the system level. Additionally, the configuration-related code shows that enabling 'postConvertWebp' results in the addition of postprocessors and processing queues, which contribute to significant performance impacts during image conversion."
