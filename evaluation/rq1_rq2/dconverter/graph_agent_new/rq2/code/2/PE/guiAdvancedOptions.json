    "Reason": "The configuration option 'guiAdvancedOptions' does not appear to be performance-sensitive based on the provided code context. The code snippet related to loading preferences does not contain any performance-intensive operations that would lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The configuration setting 'guiAdvancedOptions' is simply used to set a boolean value based on user preference, which does not directly and substantially affect system performance in a significant way."
