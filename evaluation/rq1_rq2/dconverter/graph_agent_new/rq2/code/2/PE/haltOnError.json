{
    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'haltOnError' is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the 'haltOnError' configuration directly affects system performance at the system level. In the provided code context, if 'haltOnError' is set to true, it leads to the cancellation of current jobs, shutdown of the thread pool, and immediate callback execution. This operation is time-expensive and can cause notable performance variations at the system level, making it a performance-sensitive configuration."
