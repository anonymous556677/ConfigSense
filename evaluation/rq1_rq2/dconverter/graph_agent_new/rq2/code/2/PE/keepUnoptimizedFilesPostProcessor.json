    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'keepUnoptimizedFilesPostProcessor' is performance-sensitive. This is because setting 'keepUnoptimizedFilesPostProcessor' to true will lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The code snippet 'cbKeepUnoptimized.setSelected(args.keepUnoptimizedFilesPostProcessor)' directly affects system performance by determining whether unoptimized files should be kept or not, which can have a significant impact on memory consumption and execution time. Therefore, this configuration is considered performance-sensitive."
