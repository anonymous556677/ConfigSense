    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'outputCompressionMode' is performance-sensitive. The code snippet related to this configuration involves multiple performance-related operations that are time-expensive and memory-expensive. The method 'saveToFile' includes operations like scaling images, compressing images, and writing files, which can significantly impact system performance. The configuration directly affects the execution time and memory consumption at the system level, leading to notable performance variations."
