    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'clearDirBeforeConvert' is performance-sensitive. This is because the 'clearDirBeforeConvert' configuration involves time-expensive and memory-expensive operations within the related code. Specifically, the 'clearDirBeforeConvert' configuration triggers the clearing out of directories before conversion, which can have a notable performance impact at the system level. This operation directly affects system performance by potentially increasing execution time and memory consumption, making it a performance-sensitive configuration."
