{
    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'compressionQuality' is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the 'compressionQuality' directly affects the performance of the system at the system level. The code snippet related to 'compressionQuality' involves performance-related operations that are time-expensive, such as compressing images with different quality settings. These operations can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, making the 'compressionQuality' configuration performance-sensitive."
