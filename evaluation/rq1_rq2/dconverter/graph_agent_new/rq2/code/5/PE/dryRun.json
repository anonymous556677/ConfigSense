    "Reason": "The 'dryRun' configuration option does not directly and substantially affect system performance at the system level. The code snippets related to the 'dryRun' configuration do not involve any time-expensive or memory-expensive operations that lead to notable performance variations. The 'dryRun' configuration is used for conditional logic in creating folders and does not have a significant impact on overall system performance."
