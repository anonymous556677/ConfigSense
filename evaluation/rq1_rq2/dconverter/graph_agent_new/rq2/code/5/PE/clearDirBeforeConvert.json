    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'clearDirBeforeConvert' is performance-sensitive. This is because the 'clearDirBeforeConvert' configuration involves time-extensive and memory-extensive operations within the related code. Specifically, when 'clearDirBeforeConvert' is set to true, it triggers the clearing out of directories before the conversion process, which can significantly impact system performance. This operation directly affects the execution time and memory consumption at the system level, leading to notable performance variations."
