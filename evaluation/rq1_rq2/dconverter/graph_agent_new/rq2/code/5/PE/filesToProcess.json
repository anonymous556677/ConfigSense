    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'filesToProcess' configuration option is performance-sensitive. This is because the 'filesToProcess' configuration directly affects the execution time and memory consumption of the system at the system level. The code snippet related to 'filesToProcess' involves iterating through a list of files to process, which can be time-expensive and memory-expensive operations. Additionally, the 'filesToProcess' configuration is crucial for determining the number of conversion and post-processing jobs, which significantly impact the overall performance of the system."
