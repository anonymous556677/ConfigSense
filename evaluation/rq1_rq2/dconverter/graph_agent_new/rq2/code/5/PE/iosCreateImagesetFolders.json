    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'iosCreateImagesetFolders' is performance-sensitive. This is because the 'iosCreateImagesetFolders' configuration directly impacts the system performance by creating additional folders for imagesets, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The code snippets related to this configuration involve file creation and deletion operations, which are time-expensive and memory-expensive, especially when handling multiple files. Therefore, the configuration is considered performance-sensitive based on its direct and substantial effect on system performance."
