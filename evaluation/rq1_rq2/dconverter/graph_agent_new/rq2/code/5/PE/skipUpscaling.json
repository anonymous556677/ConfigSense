    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'skipUpscaling' is not performance-sensitive based on the provided code context. The 'skipUpscaling' configuration is simply a boolean flag that determines whether to skip upscaling during image processing. This configuration does not involve any performance-related operations that are time-expensive or memory-expensive within its related code. Therefore, it does not lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
