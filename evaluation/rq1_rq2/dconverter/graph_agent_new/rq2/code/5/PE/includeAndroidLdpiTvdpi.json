    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'includeAndroidLdpiTvdpi' is performance-sensitive. This is because the 'includeAndroidLdpiTvdpi' configuration directly affects the system performance by adding density descriptors for ldpi and tvdpi, which involve performance-related operations that contribute to memory consumption and execution time. These density descriptors are added based on the value of 'arguments.includeAndroidLdpiTvdpi' in the code context, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
