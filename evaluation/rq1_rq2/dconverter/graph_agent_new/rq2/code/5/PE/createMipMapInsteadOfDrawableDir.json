    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'createMipMapInsteadOfDrawableDir' is performance-sensitive. This is because the 'createMipMapInsteadOfDrawableDir' configuration directly affects the directory prefix used in the 'getAndroidDensityDescriptors' method, which in turn impacts the creation of different density descriptors for Android resources. Depending on the value of 'createMipMapInsteadOfDrawableDir', the method will generate different directory prefixes ('mipmap' or 'drawable'), leading to notable performance variations in the system level resource handling. Therefore, this configuration is considered performance-sensitive."
