    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'enableMozJpeg' is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that enabling 'MozJpeg' involves the instantiation of a 'MozJpegProcessor' post-processor, which is a time-expensive operation. This post-processor is added to the list of post-processors and contributes to the overall execution time of the 'execute' method. Additionally, the 'MozJpegProcessor' post-processor checks if the 'jpegtran' tool is accessible, which can also impact performance. Therefore, the configuration directly affects system performance at the system level by introducing time-expensive operations within its related code, leading to notable performance variations."
