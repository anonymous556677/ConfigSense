    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'scaleMode' is performance-sensitive. This is because the 'scaleMode' directly affects the performance of the system at the system level by determining the scaling behavior of images in the conversion process. The 'scaleMode' is used in performance-related operations within the code, such as determining density buckets and high-quality dimensions based on different scaling modes. These operations are time-expensive and memory-expensive, leading to notable performance variations at the system level."
