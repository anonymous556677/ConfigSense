    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'outputCompressionMode' is performance-sensitive. The code snippet related to this configuration involves performance-related operations that are time-expensive, such as scaling images and compressing them based on the chosen compression mode. These operations directly impact system performance by consuming significant execution time and memory resources. Additionally, the configuration setting influences the behavior of multiple image processing algorithms, which further contributes to notable performance variations at the system level."
