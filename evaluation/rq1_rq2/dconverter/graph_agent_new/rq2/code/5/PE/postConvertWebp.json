    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'postConvertWebp' is performance-sensitive. This is because enabling 'postConvertWebp' involves the use of the 'WebpProcessor' post-processor, which can have a notable performance impact. The code snippet related to this configuration shows that if 'args.postConvertWebp' is true, the 'WebpProcessor' is added to the list of post-processors. Additionally, the code checks if the 'WebpProcessor' tool is supported and appends relevant log messages. This indicates that the 'postConvertWebp' configuration directly affects the execution flow and can lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
