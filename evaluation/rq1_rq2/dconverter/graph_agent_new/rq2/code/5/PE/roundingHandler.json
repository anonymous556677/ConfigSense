    "Reason": "The 'roundingHandler' configuration option does not appear to be performance-sensitive based on the provided code context. The code snippet related to 'roundingHandler' involves setting a choice in a dropdown menu, which is not a time-expensive or memory-expensive operation. There are no performance-related operations within the code snippet that would lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Therefore, the 'roundingHandler' configuration can be classified as not performance-sensitive."
