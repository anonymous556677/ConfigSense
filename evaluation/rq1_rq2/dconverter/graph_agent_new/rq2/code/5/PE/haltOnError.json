    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'haltOnError' is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the 'haltOnError' configuration directly affects system performance at the system level by potentially halting the execution of the current job and shutting down the thread pool. This can lead to notable performance variations, especially in scenarios where the 'haltOnError' condition is triggered frequently. Additionally, the 'haltOnError' configuration involves time-expensive and memory-expensive operations within the related code, such as setting the 'canceled' flag to true, shutting down the thread pool, and invoking the callback with the current job count, files, log builder, and exception list. These operations can significantly impact system performance, making the 'haltOnError' configuration performance-sensitive."
