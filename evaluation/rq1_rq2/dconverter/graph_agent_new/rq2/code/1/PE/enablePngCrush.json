    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'enablePngCrush' is performance-sensitive. This is because enabling 'enablePngCrush' triggers the execution of the PngCrushProcessor post-processor, which involves time-expensive and memory-expensive operations such as image processing and compression. These operations directly impact system performance at the system level by adding additional processing overhead and memory consumption. Therefore, the configuration option 'enablePngCrush' leads to notable performance variations and is considered performance-sensitive."
