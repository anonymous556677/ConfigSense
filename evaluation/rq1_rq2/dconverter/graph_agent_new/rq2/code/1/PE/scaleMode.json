    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'scaleMode' is performance-sensitive. The 'scaleMode' configuration directly affects the performance of the system at the system level by determining how image scaling is handled in the conversion process. The 'scaleMode' configuration is used in performance-related operations within the code, such as determining the scaling method based on different factors like width, height, or a scaling factor. This configuration leads to notable performance variations by impacting the execution time and memory consumption during image conversion, making it a performance-sensitive configuration."
