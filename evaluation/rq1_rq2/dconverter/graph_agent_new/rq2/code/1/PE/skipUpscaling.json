    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'skipUpscaling' does not appear to be performance-sensitive based on the provided code context. The 'skipUpscaling' configuration is simply a boolean flag that determines whether to skip upscaling during image processing. This operation is not time-expensive or memory-expensive and does not directly and substantially affect system performance at the system level. Therefore, it is classified as not performance-sensitive."
