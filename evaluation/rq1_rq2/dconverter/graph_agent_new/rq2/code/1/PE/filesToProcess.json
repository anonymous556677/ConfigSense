    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'filesToProcess' configuration option is performance-sensitive. This is because the 'filesToProcess' configuration directly affects the execution time and memory consumption of the system. The code snippet related to 'filesToProcess' involves iterating over the files to be processed, which can be time-expensive and memory-expensive operations. Additionally, the number of conversion and post-processing jobs are calculated based on the size of 'filesToProcess', which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Therefore, the 'filesToProcess' configuration is considered performance-sensitive."
