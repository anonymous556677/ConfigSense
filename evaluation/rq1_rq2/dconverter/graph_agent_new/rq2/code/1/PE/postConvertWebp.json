    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'postConvertWebp' is performance-sensitive. This is because enabling 'postConvertWebp' involves the use of a 'WebpProcessor' postprocessor, which is a performance-related operation that can have a notable impact on system performance. The code snippet related to this configuration shows that if 'args.postConvertWebp' is true, the 'WebpProcessor' postprocessor is added to the list of postprocessors, which can significantly affect the execution time and memory consumption of the system. Therefore, this configuration option is considered performance-sensitive."
