    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option includeAndroidLdpiTvdpi is performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly affects the system performance by including ldpi and tvdpi density descriptors in the list, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The code snippet related to this configuration involves time-expensive operations like adding density descriptors based on the includeAndroidLdpiTvdpi flag, which can impact execution time and memory consumption significantly."
