    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'verboseLog' configuration option is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the 'verboseLog' configuration directly affects the system performance by determining whether to print the log information. The code snippet related to 'verboseLog' checks if 'args.verboseLog' is true before printing the log, which involves time-expensive operations like printing to the console. If 'verboseLog' is set to true, it can lead to notable performance variations at the system level due to the additional log printing operations."
