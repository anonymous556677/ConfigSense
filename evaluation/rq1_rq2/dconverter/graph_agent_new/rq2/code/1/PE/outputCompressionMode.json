    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'outputCompressionMode' is performance-sensitive. The code snippet related to this configuration involves time-expensive and memory-expensive operations such as scaling images, compressing images, and writing files. These operations directly impact the system performance at the system level by consuming significant execution time and memory resources. The configuration choice of 'outputCompressionMode' directly influences the performance of image processing tasks, leading to notable performance variations in the system."
