    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'enableMozJpeg' is performance-sensitive. This is because enabling 'enableMozJpeg' involves adding a MozJpeg postprocessor, which is a performance-related operation that can have a notable performance impact at the system level. The code snippet related to 'enableMozJpeg' includes the addition of the MozJpeg postprocessor, which can consume significant time and memory resources during image processing. Therefore, enabling 'enableMozJpeg' directly and substantially affects system performance, making it a performance-sensitive configuration."
