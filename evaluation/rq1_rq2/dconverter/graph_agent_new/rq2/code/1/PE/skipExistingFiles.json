    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'skipExistingFiles' is performance-sensitive. This is because the 'skipExistingFiles' configuration directly affects the performance of the system by potentially skipping the processing of image files based on whether the image file already exists. This can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, as skipping existing files can save time and resources during the file processing operations. Additionally, the code snippet related to 'skipExistingFiles' shows that it is involved in a conditional check within a loop that processes image files, indicating that it has the potential to impact the overall execution time of the program."
