    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'haltOnError' is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the 'haltOnError' configuration directly affects system performance at the system level. When 'haltOnError' is set to true, the program cancels the current job, shuts down the thread pool, and invokes the callback with the current job count, processed files, log builder, and exception list. This operation is time-expensive and can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, making it a performance-sensitive configuration."
