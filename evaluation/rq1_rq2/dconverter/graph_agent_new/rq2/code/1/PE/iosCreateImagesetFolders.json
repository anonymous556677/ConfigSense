    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'iosCreateImagesetFolders' is performance-sensitive. This is because the 'iosCreateImagesetFolders' configuration directly affects the system performance by creating additional image set folders in the destination folder. This operation involves file system operations which can be time-expensive and memory-expensive, leading to notable performance variations at the system level. The code context shows that when 'iosCreateImagesetFolders' is true, additional folders are created and deleted, which can impact the overall performance of the system."
