    "Reason": "The configuration option 'guiAdvancedOptions' is not performance-sensitive. The code snippet related to this configuration does not involve any performance-related operations that are time-expensive or memory-expensive. The configuration setting 'args.guiAdvancedOptions' is simply used to determine whether to show advanced options in the GUI, which does not have a notable impact on system performance at the system level."
