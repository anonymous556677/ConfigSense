    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'enableAntiAliasing' is performance-sensitive. The code snippet related to this configuration involves a performance-related operation that applies anti-aliasing filter 'OP_ANTIALIAS' to the scaled image. Anti-aliasing operations are known to be time-expensive and can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, especially when applied to images. Therefore, enabling anti-aliasing directly and substantially affects system performance, making it a performance-sensitive configuration."
