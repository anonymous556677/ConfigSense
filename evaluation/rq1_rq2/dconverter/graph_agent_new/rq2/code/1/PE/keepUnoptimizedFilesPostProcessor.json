    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'keepUnoptimizedFilesPostProcessor' is performance-sensitive. This is because setting 'cbKeepUnoptimized' to true in the configuration involves a performance-related operation that can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The code snippet 'cbKeepUnoptimized.setSelected(args.keepUnoptimizedFilesPostProcessor)' directly affects system performance by determining whether unoptimized files should be kept, which can impact memory consumption and execution time significantly."
