{
    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'skipUpscaling' does not appear to be performance-sensitive based on the provided code context. The 'skipUpscaling' configuration is simply a boolean flag that determines whether to skip upscaling during image processing. This operation does not involve any time-expensive or memory-expensive operations within the related code. Additionally, toggling this configuration is unlikely to cause notable performance variations at the system level. Therefore, the 'skipUpscaling' configuration is classified as not performance-sensitive."
