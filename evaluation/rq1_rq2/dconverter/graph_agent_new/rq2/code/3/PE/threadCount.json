    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'threadCount' configuration option is performance-sensitive. This is because the 'threadCount' value directly affects the ThreadPoolExecutor creation in the code, which in turn impacts the number of threads available for concurrent processing. The number of threads can significantly impact the overall performance of the system, especially in scenarios where multiple tasks need to be executed concurrently. Therefore, any changes to the 'threadCount' configuration can lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
