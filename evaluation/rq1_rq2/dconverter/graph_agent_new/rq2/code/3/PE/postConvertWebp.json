    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'postConvertWebp' is performance-sensitive. This is because enabling 'postConvertWebp' involves the use of the 'cwebp' tool, which is a postprocessor for converting images to the WebP format. The code snippet related to this configuration shows that if 'postConvertWebp' is enabled, the 'WebpProcessor' postprocessor is added to the list of postprocessors. This postprocessor can have a notable performance impact as it involves processing image files using the 'cwebp' tool, which can be time-expensive and memory-expensive. Additionally, the code snippet shows that the percentage of jobs related to 'postConvertWebp' processing is calculated, indicating that it can significantly affect the overall execution time of the system-level operation."
