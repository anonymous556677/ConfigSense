    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'keepUnoptimizedFilesPostProcessor' is performance-sensitive. This is because setting 'keepUnoptimizedFilesPostProcessor' to true will lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The code snippet 'cbKeepUnoptimized.setSelected(args.keepUnoptimizedFilesPostProcessor);' directly affects system performance by determining whether unoptimized files should be kept, which can be time-expensive and memory-expensive operation. Therefore, this configuration option has a substantial impact on system performance and is classified as performance-sensitive."
