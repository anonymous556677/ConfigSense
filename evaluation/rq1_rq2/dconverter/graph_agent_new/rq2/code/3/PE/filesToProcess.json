    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'filesToProcess' configuration option is performance-sensitive. This is because the 'filesToProcess' configuration directly impacts the execution time and memory consumption of the system at a significant level. The code snippet related to 'filesToProcess' involves iterating over a list of files to process, which can be time-expensive and memory-expensive depending on the number and size of files. Additionally, the 'filesToProcess' configuration is used in multiple places within the code, affecting the overall performance of the system. Therefore, the 'filesToProcess' configuration is considered performance-sensitive."
