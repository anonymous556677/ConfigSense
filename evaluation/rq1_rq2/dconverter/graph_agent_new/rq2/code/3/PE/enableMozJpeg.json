    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'enableMozJpeg' is performance-sensitive. This is because enabling 'MozJpeg' involves the use of 'MozJpegProcessor' which is a post-processor that can significantly impact system performance. The code snippet related to 'enableMozJpeg' shows that if 'args.enableMozJpeg' is true, the 'MozJpegProcessor' is added to the list of post-processors. This post-processor can consume a significant amount of memory and processing time, leading to notable performance variations at the system level. Therefore, the configuration option 'enableMozJpeg' is considered performance-sensitive."
