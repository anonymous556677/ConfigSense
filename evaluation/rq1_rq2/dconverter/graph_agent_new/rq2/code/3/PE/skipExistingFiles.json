    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'skipExistingFiles' is performance-sensitive. This is because the 'skipExistingFiles' configuration directly affects the performance of the system by potentially skipping the processing of image files based on their existence. This can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, as skipping existing files can save processing time and memory consumption. Additionally, the code context shows that the 'skipExistingFiles' configuration is used within a loop that processes image files, and skipping existing files can impact the overall execution time and memory usage of the program."
