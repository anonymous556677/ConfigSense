    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'outputCompressionMode' is performance-sensitive. The code snippet related to this configuration involves performance-related operations that are time-expensive and memory-expensive. The 'outputCompressionMode' directly affects the execution time and memory consumption at the system level by determining the compression type used for image processing. The choice of compression mode impacts the performance of image scaling and saving operations, leading to notable performance variations in the overall system performance."
