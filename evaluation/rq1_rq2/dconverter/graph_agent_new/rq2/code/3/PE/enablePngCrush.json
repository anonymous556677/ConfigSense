    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'enablePngCrush' is performance-sensitive. This is because enabling 'enablePngCrush' triggers the execution of the 'PngCrushProcessor' post-processor, which involves time-expensive and memory-expensive operations related to image processing. These operations can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, impacting the overall execution time and memory consumption. Additionally, the code context shows that the 'enablePngCrush' configuration directly affects the post-processing workflow, indicating its significance in system performance."
