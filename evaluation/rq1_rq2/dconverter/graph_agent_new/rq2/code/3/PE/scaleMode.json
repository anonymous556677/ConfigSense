    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'scaleMode' is performance-sensitive. The 'scaleMode' configuration directly affects the performance of the system at the system level by determining the scaling behavior of images. The 'scaleMode' configuration is used in performance-related operations within the code context, such as determining the scaling buckets based on different scaling modes. This can lead to notable performance variations in terms of memory consumption and execution time, making it a performance-sensitive configuration."
