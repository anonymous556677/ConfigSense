    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The 'dryRun' configuration option does not directly involve any time-expensive or memory-expensive operations within its related code. The 'dryRun' option is used as a flag to determine whether certain operations should be executed or not, but it does not significantly impact system performance at the system level. Therefore, the 'dryRun' configuration is not classified as performance-sensitive."
