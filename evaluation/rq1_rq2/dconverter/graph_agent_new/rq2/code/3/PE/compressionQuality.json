    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'compressionQuality' is performance-sensitive. This is because the 'compressionQuality' configuration directly affects the performance of the system at the system level. The code snippet provided shows that the 'compressionQuality' is used in the 'compressJpeg' method, which is a time-expensive operation that involves compressing images. The quality of compression directly impacts the execution time and memory consumption, leading to notable performance variations at the system level."
