    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'clearDirBeforeConvert' is performance-sensitive. This is because the 'clearDirBeforeConvert' configuration involves performance-related operations that are time-expensive within its related code. Specifically, the 'clear out dirs before convert' operation can have a notable performance impact at the system level by potentially causing delays in the execution of the conversion process. Additionally, the operation involves iterating over files and checking for their existence, which can be memory-expensive and contribute to performance variations. Therefore, based on the code context and the nature of the operation, the 'clearDirBeforeConvert' configuration is classified as performance-sensitive."
