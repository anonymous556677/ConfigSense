    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'verboseLog' configuration option is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the 'args.verboseLog' condition in the code snippet indicates that when 'verboseLog' is true, additional logging information is printed, which can potentially increase the execution time and memory consumption. This extra logging operation can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, making it performance-sensitive."
