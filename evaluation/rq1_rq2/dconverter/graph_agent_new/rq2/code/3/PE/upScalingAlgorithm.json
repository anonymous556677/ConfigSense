    "Reason": "The 'upScalingAlgorithm' configuration option is not performance-sensitive. The code snippet provided does not contain any performance-related operations that are time-expensive or memory-expensive. The configuration setting 'upScalingAlgorithm' is simply being retrieved from the 'args' object based on the 'EScalingAlgorithm.Type' provided, which does not directly and substantially affect system performance at the system level."
