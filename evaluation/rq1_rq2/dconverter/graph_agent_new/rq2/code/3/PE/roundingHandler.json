    "Reason": "The 'roundingHandler' configuration option is not performance-sensitive. The code snippet related to 'roundingHandler' does not contain any performance-related operations that are time-expensive or memory-expensive. The configuration setting 'args.roundingHandler' is simply being selected from a choice list and does not directly and substantially affect system performance at the system level."
