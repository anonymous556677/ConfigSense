{
    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'enableAntiAliasing' is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that enabling anti-aliasing involves a performance-related operation that is time-expensive within the related code. Anti-aliasing can significantly impact the execution time and memory consumption of the system, leading to notable performance variations at the system level. Therefore, this configuration option directly and substantially affects system performance, making it performance-sensitive."
