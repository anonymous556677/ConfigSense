    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'haltOnError' configuration option is performance-sensitive. This is because the 'haltOnError' configuration directly affects the system performance by potentially halting the execution of jobs and shutting down the thread pool immediately when an error occurs. This operation is time-expensive and can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The code snippet related to 'haltOnError' shows that if 'haltOnError' is true, the system will be impacted significantly by terminating jobs and shutting down the thread pool, which can have a substantial impact on overall performance."
