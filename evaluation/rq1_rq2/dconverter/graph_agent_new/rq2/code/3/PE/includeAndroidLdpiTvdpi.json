    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'includeAndroidLdpiTvdpi' is performance-sensitive. This is because the 'includeAndroidLdpiTvdpi' configuration directly affects the system performance by adding density descriptors for ldpi and tvdpi, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The code snippet related to this configuration involves adding density descriptors based on the value of 'includeAndroidLdpiTvdpi', which contributes to execution time and memory consumption, making it a performance-sensitive configuration."
