    "Reason": "The 'skipExistingFiles' configuration option does not directly and substantially affect system performance at the system level. While it may impact the processing time and resources by avoiding unnecessary processing of existing image files, it does not lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The code snippet related to this configuration does not contain any time-expensive or memory-expensive operations that would classify it as performance-sensitive."
