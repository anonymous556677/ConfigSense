    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'postConvertWebp' configuration option is performance-sensitive. This is because enabling the Webp post-processor directly impacts the post-processing phase of file conversion, potentially increasing the execution time and memory consumption. The addition of the WebpProcessor post-processor and its execution, dependent on the availability of the 'cwebp' tool, introduces time-expensive and memory-expensive operations within the code context, leading to notable performance variations at the system level."
