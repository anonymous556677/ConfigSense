    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'enableMozJpeg' is performance-sensitive because it directly affects the system's performance at the system level. Enabling 'enableMozJpeg' adds the MozJpegProcessor to the list of postProcessors, which can significantly impact the execution time and memory consumption during image processing. The use of the MozJpeg tool for image compression can lead to notable performance variations, making this configuration performance-sensitive."
