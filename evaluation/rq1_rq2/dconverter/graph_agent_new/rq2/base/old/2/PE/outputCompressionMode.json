    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The outputCompressionMode configuration is performance-sensitive. This classification is based on the fact that the configuration directly affects the compression type chosen for processing images in the saveToFile method. The choice of compression algorithm can have a significant impact on the execution time and memory consumption of the system, as different compression modes result in varying file sizes and image quality. Additionally, the code snippet related to the configuration involves time-expensive operations such as image scaling and compression, which contribute to notable performance variations at the system level."
