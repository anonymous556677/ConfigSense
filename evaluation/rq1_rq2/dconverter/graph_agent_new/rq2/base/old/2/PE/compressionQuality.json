    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'compressionQuality' configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly affects the execution time and memory consumption of the system when saving images. The code snippet related to the configuration involves time-expensive operations such as compressing images with different quality settings, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The quality of compression impacts the file size of the saved images, affecting both memory consumption and processing time. Therefore, the 'compressionQuality' configuration is considered performance-sensitive based on its impact on system performance."
