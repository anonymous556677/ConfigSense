    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The 'keepUnoptimizedFilesPostProcessor' configuration option is not performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration is a boolean option that only determines whether to keep unoptimized files after processing. It does not involve any performance-related operations that are time-expensive or memory-expensive within its related code. The configuration directly impacts storage space usage, but it does not lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
