    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option clearDirBeforeConvert is classified as performance-sensitive. This is because setting clearDirBeforeConvert to true triggers the clearing out of directories before the conversion process starts. This operation involves time-expensive and memory-expensive tasks such as checking for existing files, removing files, and potentially impacting the output of the conversion process. These operations directly affect system performance at the system level by introducing notable performance variations, making the configuration performance-sensitive."
