    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'scaleMode' configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly affects the image scaling process, which is a time-expensive operation. The code snippet related to 'scaleMode' involves calculations for determining high-quality image dimensions based on the original image dimensions and scaling factor. These calculations can have a notable impact on the performance of the system, especially when dealing with large images or when frequent image conversions are performed. Therefore, the configuration is considered performance-sensitive as it leads to significant performance variations at the system level."
