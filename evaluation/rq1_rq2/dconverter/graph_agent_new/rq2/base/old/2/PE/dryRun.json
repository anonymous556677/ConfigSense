    "Reason": "The 'dryRun' configuration option does not directly and substantially affect system performance at the system level. It is used to simulate actions without actually performing them, which does not contribute to notable performance variations. The configuration-related code shows that the 'dryRun' option is simply used to determine whether actions should be executed or not based on its value, and it does not involve any time-expensive or memory-expensive operations that would lead to significant performance impacts."
