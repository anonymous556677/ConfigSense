    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'filesToProcess' configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly affects the system's performance at the system level. The code context shows that the 'filesToProcess' configuration is used to iterate over a list of files and perform various operations on them, which can be time-expensive and memory-expensive. The configuration impacts the system's performance and resource utilization significantly, especially if a large number of files are specified. Additionally, the 'filesToProcess' configuration triggers operations that can lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
