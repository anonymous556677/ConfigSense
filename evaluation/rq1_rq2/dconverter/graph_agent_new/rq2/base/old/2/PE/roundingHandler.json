    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The 'roundingHandler' configuration option is not performance-sensitive. This is because it only affects the UI behavior and user experience by setting the choiceRounding selection in the UI. It does not involve any performance-related operations that are time-expensive or memory-expensive within its related code. Additionally, the developer's understanding that the impact is limited to the UI behavior further supports the classification as not performance-sensitive."
