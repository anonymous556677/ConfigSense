    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'haltOnError' configuration option is classified as performance-sensitive. This is because when 'haltOnError' is set to true, it directly and substantially affects system performance at the system level by halting the processing of jobs immediately upon encountering an error. This can lead to notable performance variations as it can impact the overall progress of the system and potentially result in incomplete processing. Additionally, the code snippet related to 'haltOnError' in the 'onJobFinished' method contains time-expensive operations such as shutting down the thread pool and calling the callback, which further supports its classification as performance-sensitive."
