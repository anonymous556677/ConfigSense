    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'outputCompressionMode' is performance-sensitive. This is because the choice of compression mode directly affects the execution time and memory consumption during the image saving process in the 'saveToFile' method. The use of different compression algorithms and modes can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, as it impacts the size and quality of the saved image files. The code snippet related to selecting compression algorithms based on the 'outputCompressionMode' configuration involves time-expensive operations like scaling and compressing images, which contribute significantly to the overall performance of the system."
