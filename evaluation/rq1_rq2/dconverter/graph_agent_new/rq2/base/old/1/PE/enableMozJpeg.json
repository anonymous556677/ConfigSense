    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'enableMozJpeg' configuration option is performance-sensitive because it directly affects the image conversion process by adding the MozJpegProcessor postprocessor to the list of postprocessors. This postprocessor utilizes the MozJpeg tool for processing JPEG images, which can have a notable impact on system performance due to the time-expensive and memory-expensive operations involved in image processing. The configuration triggers significant performance variations at the system level by introducing additional processing steps for JPEG images, making it performance-sensitive."
