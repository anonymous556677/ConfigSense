    "Reason": "The 'dryRun' configuration option does not directly and substantially affect system performance at the system level. It is used to simulate actions and prevent unintended changes, but it does not involve any time-expensive or memory-expensive operations that lead to notable performance variations. The developer's understanding also confirms that 'dryRun' is used for decision-making and testing purposes, rather than for performance optimization."
