    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'scaleMode' configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly affects the scaling mode for image conversion in the system. The choice of scaling mode impacts the execution time and memory consumption during image conversion tasks. The code related to 'scaleMode' involves operations that contribute to the execution time and memory usage, such as calculating high-quality dimensions based on the scaling mode. These operations can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, making the 'scaleMode' configuration performance-sensitive."
