    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The 'skipUpscaling' configuration option is not performance-sensitive based on the provided code context and developer information. The configuration simply determines whether to skip upscaling of images during processing, which does not involve any time-expensive or memory-expensive operations. Additionally, the developer's understanding of the configuration confirms that it does not directly and substantially affect system performance at the system level. Therefore, the configuration does not lead to notable performance variations and should be classified as not performance-sensitive."
