    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'compressionQuality' configuration is considered performance-sensitive because it directly affects the system performance at the system level. The code snippet related to the configuration involves time-expensive operations such as compressing images with different quality levels when saving them to files. The quality of compression impacts the file size of the images, which can lead to notable performance variations in terms of memory consumption and execution time. Therefore, the 'compressionQuality' configuration is performance-sensitive."
