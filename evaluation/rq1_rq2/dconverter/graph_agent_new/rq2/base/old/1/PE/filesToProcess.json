    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'filesToProcess' configuration option is performance-sensitive. This is because the size of the list of files directly impacts the number of operations performed on these files, leading to notable performance variations at the system level. The code iterates over the list of files and performs various time-expensive and memory-expensive operations on them, such as cleaning folders, converting images, and processing files. The size of the list can significantly affect the execution time and memory consumption of the program, making it a performance-sensitive configuration."
