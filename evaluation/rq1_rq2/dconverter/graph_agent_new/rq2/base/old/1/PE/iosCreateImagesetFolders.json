    "Reason": "The 'iosCreateImagesetFolders' configuration option is not performance-sensitive. The configuration only determines whether to create an imageset folder or a root folder based on a boolean value. This decision does not involve any time-expensive or memory-expensive operations that would lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The code snippet provided shows that the configuration simply creates a folder based on the boolean value without any complex or resource-intensive operations."
