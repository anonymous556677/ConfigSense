    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'postConvertWebp' configuration option is performance-sensitive because it directly affects the execution time and memory consumption of the dconvert process at the system level. When the option is set to true, the WebpProcessor postprocessor is added to the list of postprocessors, which introduces additional processing steps and potentially increases the overall processing time and memory usage. This configuration involves time-expensive and memory-expensive operations within the related code, leading to notable performance variations during the execution of the dconvert process."
