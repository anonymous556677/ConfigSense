    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'haltOnError' configuration option is performance-sensitive because it directly affects the system performance at the system level. When 'haltOnError' is set to true, it cancels the current job, shuts down the thread pool, and triggers the callback with an error flag. These operations are time-expensive and can lead to notable performance variations by halting the processing of jobs and potentially causing incomplete processing of files. Therefore, the 'haltOnError' configuration option is considered performance-sensitive."
