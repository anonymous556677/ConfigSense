    "Reason": "The configuration option 'includeAndroidLdpiTvdpi' does not directly and substantially affect system performance at the system level. The code snippet related to this configuration involves adding ldpi and tvdpi density descriptors to a list based on the configuration value, which does not contribute significantly to time-expensive or memory-expensive operations. Therefore, the configuration is not performance-sensitive."
