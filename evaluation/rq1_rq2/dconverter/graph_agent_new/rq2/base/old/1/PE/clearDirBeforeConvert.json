    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'clearDirBeforeConvert' configuration option is classified as performance-sensitive. This is because enabling this option directly impacts system performance and storage space at the system level. The code related to this configuration involves time-expensive and memory-expensive operations, such as clearing directories before conversion, which can lead to notable performance variations. Additionally, the configuration directly affects the execution time and memory consumption during the conversion process, making it performance-sensitive."
