    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'enablePngCrush' configuration option is performance-sensitive because it directly affects the postprocessing tasks by determining whether the PngCrush postprocessor should be added to the list of postprocessors. This decision leads to notable performance variations at the system level, as enabling the option triggers additional processing for PNG files, potentially reducing their size and optimizing them. The configuration-related code clearly shows that if the option is enabled and the PngCrush tool is accessible, it will impact the execution time and memory consumption significantly by adding extra postprocessing steps. Therefore, based on the code context and the developer's explanation, the 'enablePngCrush' configuration is considered performance-sensitive."
