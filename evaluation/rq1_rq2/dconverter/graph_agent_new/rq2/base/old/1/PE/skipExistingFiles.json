    "Reason": "The 'skipExistingFiles' configuration option does not directly and substantially affect system performance at the system level. Although it may impact the frequency of file saving operations, the performance impact is not significant enough to cause notable performance variations. The code snippet related to this configuration does not contain any time-expensive or memory-expensive operations that would classify it as performance-sensitive."
