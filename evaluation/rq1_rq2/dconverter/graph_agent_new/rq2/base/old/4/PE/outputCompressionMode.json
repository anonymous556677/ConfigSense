    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'outputCompressionMode' is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the 'outputCompressionMode' directly affects the compression mode for images being processed, which in turn impacts the size and quality of the output images. The code snippets related to the configuration involve time-expensive operations such as image scaling and compression, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Therefore, the configuration is considered performance-sensitive based on its direct and substantial impact on system performance."
