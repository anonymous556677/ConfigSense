    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'enableMozJpeg' is classified as performance-sensitive. This is because enabling the 'enableMozJpeg' configuration directly impacts the image conversion process by adding a MozJpegProcessor postprocessor. The use of this postprocessor can affect the speed and efficiency of the conversion, as well as the final output quality of the images. Additionally, the code snippet related to the 'enableMozJpeg' configuration involves time-expensive and memory-expensive operations, such as adding the postprocessor to the list of postprocessors and checking if the tool is supported. These operations can lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
