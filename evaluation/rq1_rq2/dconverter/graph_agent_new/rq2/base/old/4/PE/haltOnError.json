    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'haltOnError' configuration option is classified as performance-sensitive. This is because when 'haltOnError' is set to true in the arguments, it triggers the cancellation of the current job, shutdown of the thread pool, and callback with an error parameter. These operations are time-expensive and can significantly impact system performance at the system level by disrupting the processing flow. The configuration directly affects system performance by introducing notable performance variations, making it performance-sensitive."
