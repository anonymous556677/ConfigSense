    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'compressionQuality' configuration is performance-sensitive. This is because the quality of compression directly impacts the execution time and memory consumption of the image compression process. Higher compression quality values will result in more time-expensive and memory-expensive operations, leading to notable performance variations at the system level. The configuration is directly involved in determining the compression quality of images, which is a critical factor in the performance of the image processing operations."
