    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'postConvertWebp' configuration option is classified as performance-sensitive. This is because when 'args.postConvertWebp' is set to true, a WebpProcessor postprocessor is added to the list of postprocessors in the 'execute' method. This postprocessor is responsible for converting images to the WebP format, which can have a notable impact on system performance due to the additional processing time and resources required for image conversion. Therefore, the configuration directly and substantially affects system performance at the system level by introducing time-expensive and memory-expensive operations related to image conversion."
