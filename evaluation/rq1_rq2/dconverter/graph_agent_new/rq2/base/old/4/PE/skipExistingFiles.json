    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'skipExistingFiles' does not directly and substantially affect system performance at the system level. While it may impact the efficiency of file saving operations within the 'saveToFile' method, the performance impact is not significant enough to cause notable performance variations at the system level. The configuration mainly serves to optimize file saving by skipping existing files, but it does not involve time-extensive or memory-extensive operations that would classify it as performance-sensitive."
