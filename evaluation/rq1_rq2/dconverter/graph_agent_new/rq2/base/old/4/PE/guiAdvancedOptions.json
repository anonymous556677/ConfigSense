    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The 'guiAdvancedOptions' configuration does not appear to be performance-sensitive based on the provided code context and developer information. The configuration is primarily used to set various GUI elements based on the stored values, and it does not involve any performance-related operations that significantly impact system performance at the system level. The configuration mainly deals with GUI customization and does not contribute to notable performance variations. Additionally, the developer's understanding of the configuration's impact on system resources suggests that it may affect system complexity and resource usage but does not directly lead to substantial performance variations."
