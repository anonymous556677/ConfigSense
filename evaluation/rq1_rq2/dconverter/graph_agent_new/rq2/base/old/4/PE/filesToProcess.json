    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'filesToProcess' configuration is performance-sensitive. The configuration directly impacts the system's performance by determining the list of files to be processed, which can lead to notable performance variations. The code iterates through the list of files and performs operations on them, which are time-expensive and memory-expensive. Additionally, the size of the list of files specified in the configuration can significantly affect the overall performance and resource utilization of the system."
