    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'downScalingAlgorithm' configuration is classified as performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the choice of scaling algorithm directly impacts the performance of the image processing system. The code snippet provided shows that the configuration is used to determine the scaling algorithm based on the type provided, which can have a significant impact on the execution time and memory consumption of the system. Therefore, the 'downScalingAlgorithm' configuration is considered performance-sensitive as it directly and substantially affects system performance at the system level."
