    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'filesToProcess' configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the system performance at the system level. The configuration determines the number of files to be processed, the converters and post-processors to be applied, and the overall resource utilization. The code context shows that if the 'filesToProcess' list is not empty, various operations are performed on each file in the list, which can lead to notable performance variations. Additionally, the triggering frequency of the configuration is dependent on the number of files in the list, further emphasizing its performance sensitivity."
