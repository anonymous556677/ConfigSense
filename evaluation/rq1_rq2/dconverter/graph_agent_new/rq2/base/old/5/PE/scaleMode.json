    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'scaleMode' configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the image scaling process in the system, which can lead to notable performance variations. The code uses the 'scaleMode' configuration to determine how images should be scaled, affecting the output image sizes and quality. Different scale modes can result in different performance impacts at the system level, making this configuration performance-sensitive."
