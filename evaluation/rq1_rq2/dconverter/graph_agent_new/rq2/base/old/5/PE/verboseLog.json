    "Reason": "The 'verboseLog' configuration option is not performance-sensitive based on the provided code context and developer information. The configuration only determines whether to print detailed logs during the execution of a process, and it does not directly and substantially affect system performance at the system level. The impact of the configuration on performance is related to the amount of log information that needs to be printed, which may increase output size but is not significant enough to cause notable performance variations."
