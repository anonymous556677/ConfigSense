    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The 'skipUpscaling' configuration option is not performance-sensitive based on the provided code context and developer information. The configuration is used to determine whether the application should skip upscaling images during image processing, which may impact the quality of the images and the processing speed. However, this configuration does not directly and substantially affect system performance at the system level. It mainly influences the behavior of the image processing task and does not lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
