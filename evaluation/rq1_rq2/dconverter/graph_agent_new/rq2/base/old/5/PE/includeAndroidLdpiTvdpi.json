    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'includeAndroidLdpiTvdpi' is performance-sensitive. This is because the inclusion of Android ldpi and tvdpi density descriptors directly impacts the size of the list of AndroidDensityDescriptors, affecting the processing logic that relies on this list. The addition of ldpi and tvdpi descriptors can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, making it a performance-sensitive configuration."
