    "Reason": "The 'roundingHandler' configuration option is not performance-sensitive based on the provided code context and developer information. The configuration is used to handle the rounding of values for the image processing tool, which may impact the output of the tool but does not directly and substantially affect system performance at the system level. The code snippet provided focuses on setting UI elements based on the preferences loaded, and the 'roundingHandler' configuration is just one of the many preferences being set. Therefore, the configuration is not considered performance-sensitive."
