    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'downScalingAlgorithm' configuration is classified as performance-sensitive. The configuration directly impacts the quality and performance of image processing tasks in the system. The choice of scaling algorithm can significantly affect the final output quality, processing speed, and resource utilization. The code context shows that the 'downScalingAlgorithm' configuration is crucial in determining which algorithm to use when downscaling an image, indicating its direct impact on system performance at the image processing level."
