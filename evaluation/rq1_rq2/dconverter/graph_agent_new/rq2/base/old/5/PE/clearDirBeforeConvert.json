    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'clearDirBeforeConvert' configuration option is classified as performance-sensitive. This is because enabling this configuration directly impacts the system performance by potentially clearing out directories with a large number of files before the conversion process starts. This can lead to significant performance variations at the system level, especially if there are a large number of files to be converted. The code context shows that when 'args.clearDirBeforeConvert' is true, the directories are cleared before conversion, which can have a notable impact on system performance."
