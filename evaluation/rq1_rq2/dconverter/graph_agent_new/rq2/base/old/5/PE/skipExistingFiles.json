    "Reason": "The 'skipExistingFiles' configuration option is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the system performance at the system level. When set to true, it can potentially save processing time and resources by avoiding unnecessary file saving operations for existing files, leading to notable performance variations. This is evident from the code context where the option is checked before saving the file, and if the image file already exists, the code breaks out of the loop, skipping the file saving operation."
