    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'enableMozJpeg' configuration option is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the image conversion process by adding the MozJpegProcessor postprocessor if the option is set to true. This postprocessor can affect the performance and quality of the image conversion, leading to notable performance variations at the system level. The code explicitly checks for the 'enableMozJpeg' flag and adds the postprocessor accordingly, showing a direct and substantial effect on system performance."
