    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'skipExistingFiles' configuration option is performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly affects the efficiency of the file saving process at the system level. When set to true, the code checks for the existence of image files before saving them, potentially saving processing time by avoiding unnecessary file operations. On the other hand, when set to false, it may lead to redundant file saving operations and consume additional system resources, impacting system performance. The configuration-related code includes conditional checks based on the 'skipExistingFiles' value, which directly influences the execution flow and resource consumption, making it performance-sensitive."
