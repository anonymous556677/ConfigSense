    "Reason": "The 'dryRun' configuration option does not directly and substantially affect system performance at the system level. It is used to determine whether actions should be executed or simulated, but it does not involve any time-extensive or memory-extensive operations within its related code. The 'dryRun' option simply controls the behavior of the program based on a boolean value, without causing notable performance variations at the system level."
