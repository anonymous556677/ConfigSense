    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'enableMozJpeg' is performance-sensitive because it directly affects the image conversion process by adding the MozJpeg postprocessor, which can impact the speed and quality of the output images. The code related to this configuration involves adding the MozJpegProcessor postprocessor to the list of postprocessors, which contributes to time-expensive and memory-expensive operations during image conversion. This configuration leads to notable performance variations at the system level, making it performance-sensitive."
