    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The 'skipUpscaling' configuration option does not involve any performance-related operations that are time-expensive or memory-expensive within its related code. The configuration simply determines whether to skip upscaling images during the conversion process, which is a straightforward boolean check without any significant impact on system performance. Therefore, based on the code context and developer's information, the 'skipUpscaling' configuration is classified as not performance-sensitive."
