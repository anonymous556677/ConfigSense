    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'scaleMode' configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly affects the dimensions and scaling of images during conversion, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The code related to 'scaleMode' involves time-expensive operations such as calculating dimensions and scale factors for different output densities, which can impact the overall execution time and memory consumption of the system. Therefore, the configuration is considered performance-sensitive based on its significant impact on system performance."
