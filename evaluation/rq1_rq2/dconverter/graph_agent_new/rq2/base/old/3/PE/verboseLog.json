    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The 'verboseLog' configuration option is not performance-sensitive based on the provided code context and developer information. Although the configuration involves some logging operations, the impact on system performance is minimal. The 'verboseLog' option only affects the printing of additional logging information during the execution of the 'onFinished' method, which does not involve any time-extensive or memory-extensive operations. Therefore, it does not lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
