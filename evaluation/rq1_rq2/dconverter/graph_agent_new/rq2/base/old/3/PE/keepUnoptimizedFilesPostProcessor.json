    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'keepUnoptimizedFilesPostProcessor' is classified as performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the configuration directly affects the storage space usage at the system level. When set to true, it may lead to increased storage space consumption due to retaining unoptimized files after processing. This storage space impact can have notable performance implications, especially on systems with limited storage capacity. Additionally, within the configuration-related code, the operation of keeping unoptimized files involves memory-expensive operations, such as storing additional file data, which can contribute to performance variations at the system level."
