    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'enablePngCrush' configuration option is performance-sensitive because it directly affects the system performance at the system level. When enabled, it adds the PngCrushProcessor post-processor to the list of post-processors, which can have a notable impact on performance by optimizing PNG files during the conversion process. This operation is time-expensive and memory-expensive, leading to significant performance variations at the system level."
