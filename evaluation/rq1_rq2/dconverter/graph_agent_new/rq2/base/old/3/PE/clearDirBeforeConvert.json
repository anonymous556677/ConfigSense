    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option clearDirBeforeConvert is performance-sensitive. This is because setting clearDirBeforeConvert to true triggers the operation of clearing out directories before the conversion process starts. This operation involves time-expensive and memory-expensive tasks such as checking and deleting files and folders within directories, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Additionally, the code related to this configuration option includes loops and conditional statements that iterate over files and directories, further emphasizing its performance impact."
