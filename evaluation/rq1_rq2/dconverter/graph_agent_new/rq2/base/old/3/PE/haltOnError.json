    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'haltOnError' configuration option is classified as performance-sensitive. This is because when 'haltOnError' is set to true, it directly affects the system performance by canceling the system, shutting down the thread pool, and triggering a callback with error information. These operations are time-expensive and can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, making the configuration performance-sensitive."
