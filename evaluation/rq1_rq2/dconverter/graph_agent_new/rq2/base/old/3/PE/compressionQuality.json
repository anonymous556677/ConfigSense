    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'compressionQuality' configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly affects the quality and size of the compressed images, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The code snippet related to the configuration shows that the 'compressionQuality' value is used as an argument in the compressJpeg method, which is a time-expensive operation. Depending on the value set for 'compressionQuality', the execution time and memory consumption of the compression process can vary significantly, impacting the overall system performance."
