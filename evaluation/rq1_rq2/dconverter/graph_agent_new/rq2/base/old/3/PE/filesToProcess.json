    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'filesToProcess' configuration is performance-sensitive. The configuration directly impacts the workload and resource usage of the system by determining the number of files to be processed. The code iterates over the list of files and performs various operations on them, which can be time-expensive and memory-expensive. Additionally, the size of the list of files directly affects the system's performance by influencing the number of conversion and post-processing jobs, leading to notable performance variations at the system level."
