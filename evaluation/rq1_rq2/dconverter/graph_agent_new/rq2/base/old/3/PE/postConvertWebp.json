    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'postConvertWebp' configuration option is performance-sensitive because enabling this option adds additional processing overhead to convert images to WebP format after the initial conversion process. This involves the execution of a WebpProcessor postprocessor for each file to be processed, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level due to the increased execution time and resource usage. The configuration directly and substantially affects system performance by introducing time-expensive and memory-expensive operations within the related code, making it performance-sensitive."
