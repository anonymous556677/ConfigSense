    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'threadCount' configuration is classified as performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the system performance at the system level. The code context reveals that the 'threadCount' value is used to determine the number of threads to be used during the execution of the 'dconvert' operation. The usage of multiple threads can significantly affect the performance by improving processing speed but also increasing resource consumption. Therefore, the 'threadCount' configuration involves performance-related operations that are time-extensive and memory-extensive, leading to notable performance variations at the system level."
