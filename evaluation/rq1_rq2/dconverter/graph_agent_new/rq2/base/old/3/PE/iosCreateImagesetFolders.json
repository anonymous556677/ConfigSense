    "Reason": "The 'iosCreateImagesetFolders' configuration option does not directly involve any performance-related operations that are time-expensive or memory-expensive within its related code. It simply determines whether to create an imageset folder based on a boolean value. This configuration does not lead to notable performance variations at the system level, as it primarily affects the folder structure and organization of output files, which is not a critical performance factor."
