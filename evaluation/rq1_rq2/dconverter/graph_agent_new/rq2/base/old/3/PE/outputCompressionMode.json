    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The outputCompressionMode configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly affects the performance of the system at the system level. The configuration determines the compression type for images being processed in the saveToFile method, which involves time-expensive operations such as scaling and compressing images. Different compression types can have a significant impact on the execution time and memory consumption of the system, leading to notable performance variations. Therefore, the configuration is considered performance-sensitive based on the code context and its impact on system performance."
