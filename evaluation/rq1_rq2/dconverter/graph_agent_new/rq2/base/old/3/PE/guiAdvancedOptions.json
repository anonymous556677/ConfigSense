    "Reason": "The 'guiAdvancedOptions' configuration does not appear to be performance-sensitive based on the provided code context and developer information. The configuration is mainly used to determine whether advanced options in the GUI should be displayed or hidden, which does not involve any time-expensive or memory-expensive operations. The code snippet related to loading the configuration simply sets various GUI elements based on the values stored in the configuration, without any significant impact on system performance at the system level."
