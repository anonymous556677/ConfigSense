    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'skipExistingFiles' configuration option is performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly impacts the performance of the system by potentially saving processing time and resources when files are skipped during the saving process. The code snippet related to the 'skipExistingFiles' configuration shows that if the option is set to true, the code will break out of the loop and not save the file if it already exists. This can lead to notable performance variations at the system level by avoiding unnecessary file saving operations, especially when dealing with a large number of files. Therefore, the configuration is considered performance-sensitive as it directly and substantially affects system performance by optimizing file saving operations."
