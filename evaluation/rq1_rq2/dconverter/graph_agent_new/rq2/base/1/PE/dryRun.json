    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The 'dryRun' configuration option does not directly and substantially affect system performance at the system level. It is used to simulate actions and does not contribute to notable performance variations. The code snippets related to the 'dryRun' configuration do not involve time-expensive or memory-expensive operations that would lead to significant performance impacts. Therefore, based on the code context and provided information, the 'dryRun' configuration is not classified as performance-sensitive."
