    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'scaleMode' configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts how images are scaled and processed, leading to notable performance variations at the system level. The code context shows that the 'scaleMode' configuration is used to determine density buckets and dimensions based on the specified scale mode, which can significantly affect the execution time and memory consumption during image conversion. Different scale modes result in different output image dimensions and quality, making this configuration crucial for performance optimization."
