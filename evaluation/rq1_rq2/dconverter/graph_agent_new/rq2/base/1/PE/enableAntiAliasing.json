    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'enableAntiAliasing' is classified as performance-sensitive. The code context reveals that when 'enableAntiAliasing' is enabled, the scaled image is filtered with the 'OP_ANTIALIAS' filter, which involves additional processing and can impact system performance and memory usage. Enabling anti-aliasing can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, as it introduces time-expensive and memory-expensive operations that directly affect system performance. Additionally, the developer's understanding on size impact confirms that enabling anti-aliasing can increase computational load and memory requirements, further supporting the classification of the configuration as performance-sensitive."
