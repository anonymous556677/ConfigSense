{
    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'enableMozJpeg' is performance-sensitive. This is because enabling the 'enableMozJpeg' configuration directly adds the MozJpegProcessor postprocessor to the list of postprocessors, which impacts the processing of image files during the dconvert execution. The use of the MozJpeg tool for image conversion can have a notable performance variation at the system level, affecting the execution time and memory consumption during image processing. Additionally, the code snippet related to the 'enableMozJpeg' configuration involves time-expensive and memory-expensive operations, such as adding the postprocessor and processing image files, which further supports its classification as performance-sensitive."
