    "Reason": "The 'roundingHandler' configuration does not involve any performance-related operations that are time-expensive or memory-expensive within its related code. The code snippet provided mainly deals with setting UI elements and choices based on the configuration values, which do not directly and substantially affect system performance at the system level. Therefore, the configuration is not classified as performance-sensitive."
