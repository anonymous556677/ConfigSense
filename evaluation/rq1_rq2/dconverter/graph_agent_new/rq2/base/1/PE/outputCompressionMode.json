    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'outputCompressionMode' is performance-sensitive. The code context reveals that the 'outputCompressionMode' directly affects the compression mode for the output images during image processing tasks. The method 'getOutCompressionForType' determines the compression types based on the specified mode, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Different compression modes impact the size of the output images, affecting both memory consumption and execution time. Therefore, the configuration is considered performance-sensitive as it involves performance-related operations that contribute significantly to system performance."
