    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'filesToProcess' configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the processing time and resource utilization of the system. The code iterates over the list of files specified in the configuration and performs various operations on them, which can be time-expensive and memory-expensive. The size of the list of files specified in the configuration can significantly affect the overall performance of the system, making it a performance-sensitive configuration."
