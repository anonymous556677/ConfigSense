    "Reason": "The 'verboseLog' configuration option is not performance-sensitive based on the provided code context and developer information. The configuration setting only determines whether to print detailed logs during the execution of a process. The code related to the 'verboseLog' configuration does not involve any time-expensive or memory-expensive operations that would lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Additionally, the 'verboseLog' configuration does not directly and substantially affect system performance, as it only controls the printing of log information."
