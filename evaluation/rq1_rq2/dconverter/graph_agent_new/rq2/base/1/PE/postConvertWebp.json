    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'postConvertWebp' configuration option is performance-sensitive. This is because enabling the 'postConvertWebp' option adds the WebpProcessor post-processor to the list of post-processors, which can significantly impact the processing time and resources required for the conversion process. The addition of the Webp post-processor involves memory-expensive and time-expensive operations within the code, leading to notable performance variations at the system level during the conversion process."
