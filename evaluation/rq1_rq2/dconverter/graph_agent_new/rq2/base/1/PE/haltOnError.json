    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'haltOnError' configuration option is classified as performance-sensitive. This is because setting 'haltOnError' to true directly impacts the system performance by canceling the current job, shutting down the thread pool, and triggering a callback with an error flag. This operation is time-expensive and can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The configuration-related code snippet clearly shows that 'haltOnError' affects the flow of job processing and can potentially halt the processing of other jobs, impacting the overall completion of the task."
