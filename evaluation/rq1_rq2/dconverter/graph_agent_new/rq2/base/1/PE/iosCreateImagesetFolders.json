    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The 'iosCreateImagesetFolders' configuration option does not appear to be performance-sensitive based on the provided code context and developer information. The configuration is primarily used to determine folder structure for iOS images, and the operations related to this configuration do not seem to have a significant impact on system performance. The code snippets related to this configuration involve folder creation and deletion based on the configuration value, which are not time-expensive or memory-expensive operations. Therefore, the configuration is not classified as performance-sensitive."
