    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'clearDirBeforeConvert' is classified as performance-sensitive. This is because setting this option to true triggers the operation of clearing directories before the conversion process starts, which involves time-expensive and memory-expensive operations such as checking and deleting files. This operation can have a notable performance impact at the system level, especially if there are a large number of files to be processed. Additionally, the code context shows that the operation involves iterating through files and performing checks before deletion, which can contribute to significant performance variations during the conversion process."
