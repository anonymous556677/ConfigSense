    "Reason": "The 'skipUpscaling' configuration option does not involve any performance-related operations that are time-extensive or memory-extensive within its related code. The code snippet provided only shows that the option is loaded from the preference store and used to set the value of a checkbox in the user interface. It does not directly and substantially affect system performance at the system level, and skipping upscaling during image processing is not a time-expensive or memory-expensive operation."
