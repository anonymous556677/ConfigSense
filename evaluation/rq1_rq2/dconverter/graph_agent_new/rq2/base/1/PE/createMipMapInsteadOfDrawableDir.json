    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'createMipMapInsteadOfDrawableDir' does not directly involve any performance-related operations that are time-extensive or memory-extensive within its related code. It simply determines whether to use 'mipmap' or 'drawable' directory prefix based on a boolean value. This decision does not lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Therefore, it is classified as not performance-sensitive."
