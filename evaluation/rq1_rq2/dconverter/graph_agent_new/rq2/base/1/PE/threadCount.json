    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'threadCount' configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the system's performance by determining the number of threads in the ThreadPoolExecutor. This configuration affects the level of parallelism and resource utilization, leading to notable performance variations at the system level. The code context shows that the thread count is crucial for managing concurrent tasks efficiently, making it a key factor in system performance."
