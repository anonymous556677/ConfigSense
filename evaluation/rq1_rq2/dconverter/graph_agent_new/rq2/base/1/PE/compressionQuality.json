    "Reason": "The 'compressionQuality' configuration is performance-sensitive. This is because the quality of compression directly impacts the execution time and memory consumption when saving images to files. Higher compression quality values will result in more time-expensive and memory-expensive operations, leading to notable performance variations at the system level. The code snippet shows that the 'compressionQuality' configuration is used to determine the quality of compression applied to images, specifically for JPG compression, which directly affects the performance of image processing and file saving operations."
