    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'scaleMode' configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the image scaling process, which involves time-expensive operations such as calculating density buckets based on the scale mode specified in the 'args' parameter. This leads to notable performance variations at the system level, as the choice of scale mode affects the dimensions and quality of the resulting images, ultimately influencing the overall execution time and memory consumption during image conversion."
