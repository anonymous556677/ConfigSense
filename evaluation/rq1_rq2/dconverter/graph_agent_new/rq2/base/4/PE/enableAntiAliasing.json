    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'enableAntiAliasing' is classified as performance-sensitive. Enabling anti-aliasing using the OP_ANTIALIAS filter on the scaled image can have a notable impact on system performance. Anti-aliasing operations are known to be time-expensive and memory-expensive, especially for larger images or when processing a large number of images. This configuration directly affects the processing time and memory consumption at the system level, leading to notable performance variations. The code snippet related to the configuration shows that enabling anti-aliasing involves applying a filter to the scaled image, which contributes to the performance impact."
