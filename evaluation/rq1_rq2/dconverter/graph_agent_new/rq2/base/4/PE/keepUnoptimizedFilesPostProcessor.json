    "Reason": "The 'keepUnoptimizedFilesPostProcessor' configuration option does not involve any performance-related operations that are time-expensive or memory-expensive within its related code. It simply determines whether to keep unoptimized files after processing, which does not directly and substantially affect system performance at the system level. The configuration is more focused on storage management rather than performance optimization."
