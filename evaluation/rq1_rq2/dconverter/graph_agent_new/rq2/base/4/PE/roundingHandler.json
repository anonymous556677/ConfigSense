    "Reason": "The 'roundingHandler' configuration does not involve any performance-related operations that are time-expensive or memory-expensive within its related code. The code snippet provided mainly deals with setting UI elements and choices based on the configuration values stored in the preference store. While the configuration impacts the behavior of the application by determining how rounding of numerical values is handled, it does not lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Therefore, it is considered not performance-sensitive."
