    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option clearDirBeforeConvert is classified as performance-sensitive. This is because setting clearDirBeforeConvert to true triggers a significant performance-related operation within the execute method. When clearDirBeforeConvert is true, the code iterates through the list of converters and cleans out directories before starting the conversion process. This operation can have a notable impact on system performance and resource usage, especially when there are a large number of files to process and the directories are large in size. Therefore, the configuration directly and substantially affects system performance at the system level, making it performance-sensitive."
