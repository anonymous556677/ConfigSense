    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'threadCount' configuration is classified as performance-sensitive. This is because the 'threadCount' directly affects the ThreadPoolExecutor's behavior in the WorkerHandler constructor, which can significantly impact system performance. The number of threads specified can lead to notable performance variations at the system level by influencing parallelism and resource utilization. The code context shows that the 'threadCount' configuration is crucial for determining the concurrency of tasks and can have a substantial impact on execution time and memory consumption."
