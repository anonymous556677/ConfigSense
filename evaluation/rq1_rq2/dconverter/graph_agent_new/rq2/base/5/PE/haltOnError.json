    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'haltOnError' configuration option is classified as performance-sensitive. This is because the 'haltOnError' configuration directly impacts the behavior of the system at the system level. When 'haltOnError' is set to true, it can lead to the immediate cancellation of jobs, shutdown of the thread pool, and handling of errors, which can significantly affect the overall performance and completion of tasks in the system. The configuration-related code clearly shows that if 'haltOnError' is true, it triggers actions that can have notable performance variations and directly impact system performance."
