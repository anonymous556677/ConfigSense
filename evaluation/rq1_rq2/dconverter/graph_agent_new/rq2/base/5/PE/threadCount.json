    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'threadCount' configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the concurrency and parallelism of task execution in the system. The number specified for 'threadCount' determines how many threads are utilized in the ThreadPoolExecutor, affecting the system's ability to process tasks in parallel. A higher thread count can improve performance by allowing more tasks to be processed simultaneously, but it can also increase resource consumption and contention. Conversely, a lower thread count may reduce resource usage but could lead to slower task execution. Therefore, the 'threadCount' configuration has a notable performance impact at the system level."
