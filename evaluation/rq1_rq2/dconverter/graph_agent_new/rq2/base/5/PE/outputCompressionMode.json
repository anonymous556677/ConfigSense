    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'outputCompressionMode' is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the size and quality of the output images, which in turn affects the overall system performance. The code context shows that the 'outputCompressionMode' configuration is used to determine the compression mode for output images, which is crucial for image processing and file saving operations. Different compression modes lead to different file sizes and image qualities, resulting in notable performance variations at the system level."
