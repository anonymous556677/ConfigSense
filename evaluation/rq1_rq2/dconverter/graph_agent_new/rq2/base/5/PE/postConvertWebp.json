    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'postConvertWebp' configuration option is classified as performance-sensitive. This is because enabling the Webp post-processing after conversion adds an additional postprocessor (WebpProcessor) to the list of postprocessors to be executed during image conversion. This can potentially increase the processing time and resource usage of the system, especially if there are a large number of files to be converted and the Webp processing is enabled for each file. The configuration directly and substantially affects system performance at the system level by introducing additional processing steps and resource utilization."
