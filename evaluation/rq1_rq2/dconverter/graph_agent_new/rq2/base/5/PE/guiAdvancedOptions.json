    "Reason": "The 'guiAdvancedOptions' configuration option is not performance-sensitive based on the provided code context and developer information. The configuration is primarily used to determine the visibility of advanced options in the GUI, which does not directly and substantially affect system performance at the system level. It mainly impacts the user interface complexity, rather than causing significant performance variations. The code snippet provided focuses on setting UI elements based on the configuration value, without any computationally intensive operations or system-level performance impacts."
