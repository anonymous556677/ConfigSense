    "Reason": "The 'keepUnoptimizedFilesPostProcessor' configuration option is not performance-sensitive based on the provided code context and developer information. The configuration primarily deals with file storage management and does not directly impact system performance at the system level. It simply determines whether to keep unoptimized files after processing, which affects storage space usage but does not lead to notable performance variations. Additionally, the configuration is only triggered when the loadPrefs method is called, which is not a critical performance-sensitive operation."
