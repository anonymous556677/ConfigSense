    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'compressionQuality' is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the file size and quality of compressed images, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The code context shows that the 'compressionQuality' value is used when compressing images to either JPEG or PNG format, affecting the processing time and resource utilization during image compression. Higher compression quality values result in larger file sizes and potentially longer processing times, while lower values may reduce file size but could impact image quality. Therefore, changes in the 'compressionQuality' configuration can have a significant impact on system performance, making it performance-sensitive."
