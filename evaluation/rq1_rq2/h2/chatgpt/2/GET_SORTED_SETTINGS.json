    "Reason": "The GET_SORTED_SETTINGS configuration option is performance-sensitive because changing its value can significantly impact the sorting algorithm used in the system. Depending on the sorting algorithm chosen, it can lead to notable variations in execution time, especially when dealing with large datasets. Therefore, the configuration change can have a direct impact on system performance."
