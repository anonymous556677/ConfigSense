    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option ESTIMATED_FUNCTION_TABLE_ROWS in the h2 software project is performance-sensitive because changing its value can significantly impact the query execution time and memory consumption. This configuration determines the estimated number of rows in function tables, which directly affects query optimization and resource allocation. A higher value can lead to increased memory usage and longer query execution times, while a lower value can result in faster queries but potentially inaccurate estimations. Therefore, any change in this configuration can have a notable impact on system performance."
