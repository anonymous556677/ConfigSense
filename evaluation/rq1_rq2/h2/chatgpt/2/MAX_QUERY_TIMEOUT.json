    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The MAX_QUERY_TIMEOUT configuration option in the h2 software project determines the maximum time allowed for a query to execute before timing out. Changing this value can significantly impact system performance, as a longer timeout may lead to increased resource consumption and slower response times, while a shorter timeout may improve system performance by preventing long-running queries from affecting overall system responsiveness. Therefore, the MAX_QUERY_TIMEOUT configuration is considered performance-sensitive."
