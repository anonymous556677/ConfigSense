    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The QUERY_CACHE_SIZE configuration option in the h2 software project is performance-sensitive because changing its value can significantly impact system performance. A larger QUERY_CACHE_SIZE can lead to increased memory consumption and potentially slower query execution times, while a smaller QUERY_CACHE_SIZE can result in reduced memory usage but potentially faster query execution times. Therefore, any change in the QUERY_CACHE_SIZE value can have notable variations in system performance, making it a performance-sensitive configuration."
