    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The DEFAULT_TABLE_ENGINE configuration option in the h2 software project is performance-sensitive because changing the table engine can have a significant impact on system performance. Different table engines have different performance characteristics, such as speed of data retrieval and storage efficiency, which can directly affect execution time and memory consumption. Therefore, changes to the DEFAULT_TABLE_ENGINE configuration can lead to notable variations in system performance."
