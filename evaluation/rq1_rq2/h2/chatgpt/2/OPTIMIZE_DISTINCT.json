    "Reason": "The OPTIMIZE_DISTINCT configuration option in the h2 software project is performance-sensitive because changing its value can significantly impact the execution time and memory consumption of the system. When set to optimize distinct queries, the system may use different algorithms or data structures that can affect the overall performance of the system, leading to notable variations in performance metrics."
