    "Reason": "The configuration option OPTIMIZE_IN_SELECT in the h2 software project is performance-sensitive because changing its value can significantly impact the execution time of queries that involve SELECT statements. When set to true, it enables optimization in SELECT queries, which can improve query performance by utilizing indexes more efficiently. However, if set incorrectly or inappropriately, it can lead to increased memory consumption and slower query execution times, affecting overall system performance."
