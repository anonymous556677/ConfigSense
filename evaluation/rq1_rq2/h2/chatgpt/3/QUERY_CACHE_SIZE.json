    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The QUERY_CACHE_SIZE configuration option in the h2 software project is performance-sensitive because changing its value can significantly impact system performance. A larger QUERY_CACHE_SIZE can lead to increased memory consumption and potentially slower execution times, especially when dealing with large datasets or complex queries. On the other hand, a smaller QUERY_CACHE_SIZE may result in more frequent cache misses and increased query processing times. Therefore, the value of QUERY_CACHE_SIZE has a notable effect on system performance, making it a performance-sensitive configuration."
