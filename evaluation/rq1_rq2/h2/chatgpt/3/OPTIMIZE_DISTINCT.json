    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option OPTIMIZE_DISTINCT in the h2 software project is performance-sensitive because changing its value significantly affects the execution time and memory consumption of the system. When set to optimize distinct queries, the system may experience notable variations in performance due to the optimization techniques applied to handle distinct queries efficiently. Therefore, any change in this configuration can have a noticeable impact on the overall system performance."
