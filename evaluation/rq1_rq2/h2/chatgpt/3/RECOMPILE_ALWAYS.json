    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The RECOMPILE_ALWAYS configuration option is performance-sensitive because changing its value can significantly impact system performance. When set to true, the software will recompile code every time it is executed, leading to increased execution time and potentially higher memory consumption. This can cause notable variations in performance, making it a critical configuration to consider for optimizing system performance."
