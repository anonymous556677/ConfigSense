    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option ESTIMATED_FUNCTION_TABLE_ROWS in the h2 software project is performance-sensitive because changing its value can significantly impact the query execution time and memory consumption. This configuration determines the estimated number of rows in function tables, which can affect the query optimizer's decisions and overall query performance. A higher value may lead to increased memory usage and longer execution times, while a lower value may result in more efficient queries. Therefore, any changes to this configuration can have a noticeable impact on system performance."
