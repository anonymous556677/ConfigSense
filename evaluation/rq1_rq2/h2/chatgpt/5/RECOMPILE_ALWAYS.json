    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The RECOMPILE_ALWAYS configuration option is performance-sensitive because changing its value can significantly impact system performance. When set to 'true', the software will recompile code every time it is executed, leading to increased execution time and higher memory consumption. This can cause notable variations in system performance, making it a performance-sensitive configuration."
