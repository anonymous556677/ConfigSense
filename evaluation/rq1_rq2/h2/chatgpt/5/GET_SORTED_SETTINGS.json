    "Reason": "The GET_SORTED_SETTINGS configuration option is performance-sensitive because changing its value can significantly impact the system's performance. This configuration likely affects the sorting algorithm used in the software, which can have a direct impact on execution time and memory consumption, especially when dealing with large datasets. Therefore, any changes to this configuration can lead to notable variations in system performance."
