    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The QUERY_CACHE_SIZE configuration determines the size of the cache used for storing query results in memory. A larger cache size can significantly improve performance by reducing the need to re-execute queries. On the other hand, a smaller cache size may lead to more frequent query executions, increasing overall system latency and resource consumption. Therefore, changes in the QUERY_CACHE_SIZE value can have a notable impact on system performance, making it a performance-sensitive configuration."
