    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option ESTIMATED_FUNCTION_TABLE_ROWS in the h2 software project is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the size of the function table, which can significantly affect the execution time and memory consumption of the system. A higher value for ESTIMATED_FUNCTION_TABLE_ROWS can lead to increased memory usage and potentially slower performance due to larger data structures being created and maintained."
