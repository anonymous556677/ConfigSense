    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option CASE_INSENSITIVE_IDENTIFIERS is performance-sensitive because changing the value from case-insensitive to case-sensitive can significantly impact system performance. When identifiers are case-insensitive, it may require additional processing and comparisons during runtime, leading to increased execution time and potentially higher memory consumption. Therefore, this configuration option can have a notable effect on system performance."
