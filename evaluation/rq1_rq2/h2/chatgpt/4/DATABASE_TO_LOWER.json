    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The DATABASE_TO_LOWER configuration option is performance-sensitive because changing this setting can significantly impact system performance. When set to true, the database performs case-insensitive comparisons, which can lead to increased execution time and memory consumption due to additional processing required for string comparisons. On the other hand, setting it to false can improve performance by reducing the overhead of case-insensitive comparisons. Therefore, the value of this configuration option has a notable effect on system performance, making it performance-sensitive."
