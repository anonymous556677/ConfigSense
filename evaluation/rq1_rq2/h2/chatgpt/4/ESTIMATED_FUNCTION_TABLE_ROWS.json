    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option ESTIMATED_FUNCTION_TABLE_ROWS in the h2 software project is performance-sensitive because changing its value can significantly impact the query execution time and memory consumption. This configuration determines the estimated number of rows in function tables, which directly affects the query optimization and execution plans. A higher value can lead to increased memory usage and longer query execution times, while a lower value can result in more efficient queries but with potential inaccuracies in query results."
