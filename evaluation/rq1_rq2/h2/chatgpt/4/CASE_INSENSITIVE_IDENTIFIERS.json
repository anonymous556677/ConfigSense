    "Reason": "The configuration option CASE_INSENSITIVE_IDENTIFIERS can significantly impact system performance. Changing this option can lead to variations in execution time, especially in operations that involve string comparisons or lookups. For example, enabling case-insensitive identifiers may require additional processing overhead to handle different cases, leading to increased execution time and potentially higher memory consumption."
