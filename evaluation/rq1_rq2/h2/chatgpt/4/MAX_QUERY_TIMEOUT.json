    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The MAX_QUERY_TIMEOUT configuration option in the h2 software project determines the maximum time allowed for a query to execute before it times out. Changing this value can have a significant impact on system performance, as a longer timeout may lead to increased resource consumption and potentially slower response times, while a shorter timeout may improve system responsiveness but risk prematurely terminating queries. Therefore, the value change of MAX_QUERY_TIMEOUT can notably affect execution time and resource utilization, making it a performance-sensitive configuration."
