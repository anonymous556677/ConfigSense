    "Reason": "The OPTIMIZE_IN_SELECT configuration option in the h2 software project is performance-sensitive because changing its value can significantly impact system performance. This configuration affects the optimization strategy used in SELECT queries, which can lead to notable variations in execution time and resource consumption. Therefore, it is crucial to carefully consider and test different values for this configuration to ensure optimal system performance."
