    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The RECOMPILE_ALWAYS configuration option in the h2 software project is performance-sensitive because changing its value can significantly impact system performance. When set to recompile always, the system will need to constantly recompile code, leading to increased execution time and potentially higher memory consumption. This can result in notable variations in system performance, making it a performance-sensitive configuration."
