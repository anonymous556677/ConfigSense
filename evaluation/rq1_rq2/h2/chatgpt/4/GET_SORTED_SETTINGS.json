    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option GET_SORTED_SETTINGS is performance-sensitive because changing its value significantly impacts the execution time of sorting operations in the h2 software project. When this configuration is enabled, the system needs to sort data before processing it, which can lead to notable variations in execution time, especially when dealing with large datasets. Therefore, the value change of GET_SORTED_SETTINGS has a direct impact on system performance."
