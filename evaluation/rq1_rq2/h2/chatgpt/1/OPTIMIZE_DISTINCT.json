    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The OPTIMIZE_DISTINCT configuration option in the h2 software project is performance-sensitive because changing its value can significantly impact system performance. When set to optimize distinct queries, it can improve query execution time by reducing the number of distinct values to be processed. However, if not optimized properly, it can also increase memory consumption and potentially slow down query performance. Therefore, any changes to this configuration should be carefully evaluated to ensure optimal system performance."
