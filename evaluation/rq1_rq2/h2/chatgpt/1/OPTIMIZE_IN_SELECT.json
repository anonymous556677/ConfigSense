    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The OPTIMIZE_IN_SELECT configuration option in the h2 software project is performance-sensitive because changing its value can significantly impact the execution time and memory consumption of queries that involve SELECT statements. When set to true, the optimization allows for faster query execution by optimizing the selection process. However, when set to false, the optimization is disabled, leading to potentially slower query performance and increased memory usage. Therefore, the value of this configuration option directly affects the overall system performance."
