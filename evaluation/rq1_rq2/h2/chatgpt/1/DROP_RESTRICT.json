    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option DROP_RESTRICT in the h2 software project is performance-sensitive because changing its value can significantly impact system performance. When set to restrict dropping, it may lead to increased memory consumption and slower execution time due to the system's need to retain more data. On the other hand, when set to not restrict dropping, it may result in faster execution time but potentially higher risk of data loss, which can also affect system performance. Therefore, the value change of DROP_RESTRICT can cause notable variations in both execution time and memory consumption, making it a performance-sensitive configuration."
