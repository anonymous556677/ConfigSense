    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The RECOMPILE_ALWAYS configuration option in the h2 software project is performance-sensitive because changing its value can significantly impact system performance. When set to 'true', the software will recompile code every time it is executed, leading to increased execution time and potentially higher memory consumption. This constant recompilation process can cause notable variations in performance, making it a performance-sensitive configuration."
