    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The DEFAULT_TABLE_ENGINE configuration option in the h2 software project is performance-sensitive because changing the table engine can have a significant impact on system performance. Different table engines have different algorithms and optimizations, which can affect execution time and memory consumption. For example, switching to a more efficient table engine can improve query performance, while using a less optimized engine can slow down database operations."
