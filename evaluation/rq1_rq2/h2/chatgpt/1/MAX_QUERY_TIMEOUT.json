    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The MAX_QUERY_TIMEOUT configuration option in the h2 software project is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the execution time of queries. A higher value for MAX_QUERY_TIMEOUT can lead to longer query execution times, potentially causing delays in system response. On the other hand, a lower value can result in quicker query execution but may also increase the risk of timeouts and errors. Therefore, any change in the value of MAX_QUERY_TIMEOUT can significantly affect system performance, making it a performance-sensitive configuration."
