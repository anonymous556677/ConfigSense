    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option ESTIMATED_FUNCTION_TABLE_ROWS in the h2 software project is performance-sensitive because changing its value can significantly impact the query execution time and memory consumption. This configuration determines the estimated number of rows in function tables, which directly affects the query optimizer's decision-making process and can lead to variations in query performance. Therefore, it is crucial to carefully tune this configuration for optimal system performance."
