    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The configuration option MAX_QUERY_TIMEOUT is not performance-sensitive. The code snippet provided does not involve any performance-related operations that are time-expensive or memory-expensive. The setting of the query timeout value based on the maximum query timeout setting from the database settings does not lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Therefore, this configuration does not directly and substantially affect system performance in a way that would classify it as performance-sensitive."
