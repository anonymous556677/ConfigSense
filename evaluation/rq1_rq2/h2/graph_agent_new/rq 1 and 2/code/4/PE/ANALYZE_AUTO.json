    "Reason": "The configuration option ANALYZE_AUTO in the provided code context does not involve any performance-sensitive operations that significantly impact system performance. The code snippet mainly initializes some variables and creates an index, which are not time-expensive or memory-expensive operations. Therefore, the configuration ANALYZE_AUTO is not classified as performance-sensitive."
