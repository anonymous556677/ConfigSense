    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option DEFAULT_TABLE_ENGINE is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the tableEngine parameter within the configuration-related code directly impacts the system performance at the system level. The code snippet shows that the tableEngine parameter is used to determine the engine for creating tables, which can have a significant performance impact depending on the engine chosen. This parameter is crucial for creating tables efficiently and can lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
