    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option DATABASE_TO_LOWER is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the configuration involves performance-related operations within its related code that are time-extensive. Specifically, the code snippet in the getValue method checks if the database setting databaseToLower is enabled and then converts the string to lower case using StringUtils.toLowerEnglish method. This operation can have a notable performance impact at the system level, especially when dealing with large datasets or frequent string manipulations. Therefore, the configuration is considered performance-sensitive."
