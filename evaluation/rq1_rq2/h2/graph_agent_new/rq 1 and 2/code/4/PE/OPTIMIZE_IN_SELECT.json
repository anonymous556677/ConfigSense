    "Reason": "The configuration option OPTIMIZE_IN_SELECT is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the configuration directly affects the system performance at the system level. In the provided code context, the configuration setting 'optimizeInSelect' is checked before executing certain code paths. This setting influences the execution flow and can lead to notable performance variations based on whether it is enabled or disabled. The code snippet contains conditional statements that branch execution based on the value of 'optimizeInSelect', indicating that it has a significant impact on the performance of the system."
