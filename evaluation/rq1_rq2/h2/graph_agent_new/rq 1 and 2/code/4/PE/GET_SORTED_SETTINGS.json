    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option GET_SORTED_SETTINGS is performance-sensitive. This is because the code context involves operations that iterate over database settings and add them to the session rows. These operations can be time-expensive and memory-expensive, especially when dealing with a large number of settings. Additionally, the configuration directly affects system performance at the system level by retrieving and processing database settings, which can lead to notable performance variations."
