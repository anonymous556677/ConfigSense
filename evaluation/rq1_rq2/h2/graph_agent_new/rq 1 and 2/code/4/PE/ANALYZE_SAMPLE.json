{
    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'ANALYZE_SAMPLE' is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the 'analyzeTables' method involves performance-related operations that are time-expensive, such as analyzing tables and committing transactions. These operations can have a notable performance impact at the system level, especially when dealing with large datasets. Additionally, the configuration directly affects system performance by determining the sample size for analysis, which can lead to significant performance variations based on the specified value."
