    "Reason": "The configuration option OPTIMIZE_SIMPLE_SINGLE_ROW_SUBQUERIES is not performance-sensitive. The code context provided does not contain any performance-intensive operations that would lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The configuration-related code mainly focuses on query optimization and setting types, which are not time-expensive or memory-expensive operations."
