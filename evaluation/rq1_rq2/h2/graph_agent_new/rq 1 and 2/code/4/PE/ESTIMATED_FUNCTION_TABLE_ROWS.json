    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option ESTIMATED_FUNCTION_TABLE_ROWS is performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly affects the system performance at the system level by determining the expected number of rows in a table. The code snippet shows that the configuration is used to calculate the cost of a query, which can have a significant impact on execution time. Additionally, the configuration involves a performance-related operation (getRowcountApproximation) that is time-expensive within its related code, leading to notable performance variations at the system level."
