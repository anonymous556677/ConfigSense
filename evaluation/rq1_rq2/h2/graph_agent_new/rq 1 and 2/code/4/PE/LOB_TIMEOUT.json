    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'LOB_TIMEOUT' is performance-sensitive. The code snippet provided shows that the 'LOB_TIMEOUT' configuration is directly used to calculate the 'keepYoungerThan' value, which is then used in a loop to check for timeout conditions. This calculation and loop operation are time-expensive and can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, making the 'LOB_TIMEOUT' configuration performance-sensitive."
