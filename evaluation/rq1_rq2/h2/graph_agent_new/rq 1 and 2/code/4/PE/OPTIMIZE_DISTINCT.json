    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option OPTIMIZE_DISTINCT is performance-sensitive. This is because the code snippet related to this configuration involves operations that are time-expensive and memory-expensive. The optimization of distinct queries based on selectivity and index conditions can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Additionally, the configuration directly and substantially affects system performance by optimizing distinct queries, which can have a significant impact on execution time and memory consumption."
