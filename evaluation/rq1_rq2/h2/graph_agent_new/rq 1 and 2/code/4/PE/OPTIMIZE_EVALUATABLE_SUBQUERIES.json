{
    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'OPTIMIZE_EVALUATABLE_SUBQUERIES' is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the configuration directly affects system performance at the system level. In the provided code context, the configuration setting 'optimizeEvaluatableSubqueries' is checked within the 'EVALUATABLE' case of the ExpressionVisitor. This setting can potentially impact the performance of subqueries evaluation, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Therefore, the configuration is considered performance-sensitive."
