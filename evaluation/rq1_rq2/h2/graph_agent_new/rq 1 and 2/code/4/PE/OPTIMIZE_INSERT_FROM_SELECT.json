    "Reason": "The configuration option OPTIMIZE_INSERT_FROM_SELECT is not performance-sensitive. The code related to this configuration does not involve any time-expensive or memory-expensive operations that would lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The configuration check 'if (db.getSettings().optimizeInsertFromSelect)' is not directly impacting system performance significantly, and the operations within the related code are not time-extensive or memory-expensive."
