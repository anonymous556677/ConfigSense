The time between running ANALYZE doubles each time since starting the database.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the 'ANALYZE_AUTO' configuration option is that it helps in maintaining the performance of the database by periodically running the ANALYZE operation to update table statistics. This can improve query performance and optimize query execution plans. However, running ANALYZE too frequently can add overhead to the system, so it is important to set the configuration value appropriately based on the workload and size of the database."
