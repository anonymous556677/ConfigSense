    "Reason": "The MAX_QUERY_TIMEOUT configuration option is not performance-sensitive. The code snippet provided does not contain any performance-related operations that are time-expensive or memory-expensive. The configuration setting is simply checking and setting a query timeout value based on a maximum value from database settings, which does not lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
