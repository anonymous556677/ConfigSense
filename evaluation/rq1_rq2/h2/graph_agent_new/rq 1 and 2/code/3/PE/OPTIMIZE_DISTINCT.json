    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option OPTIMIZE_DISTINCT is performance-sensitive. This is because the code snippet related to this configuration involves performance-related operations that are time-expensive and memory-expensive. The configuration directly affects system performance at the system level by optimizing distinct queries based on certain conditions. The optimization process involves checking selectivity, setting indexes, and sorting data using indexes, which can lead to notable performance variations in the system."
