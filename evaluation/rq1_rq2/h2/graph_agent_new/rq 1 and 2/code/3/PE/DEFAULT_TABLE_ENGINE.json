    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option DEFAULT_TABLE_ENGINE is performance-sensitive. This is because the tableEngine parameter directly affects the engine used for creating tables, which can have a significant impact on system performance. The code context shows that the tableEngine parameter is used to determine the engine for creating tables, and this choice can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Therefore, the configuration is considered performance-sensitive."
