    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option OPTIMIZE_IN_LIST is performance-sensitive. The code context shows that the OPTIMIZE_IN_LIST configuration directly affects the system performance by checking the session settings and optimizing the index conditions based on the settings. This configuration involves performance-related operations such as checking the type of columns, comparing values, and adding index conditions, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Therefore, it is classified as performance-sensitive."
