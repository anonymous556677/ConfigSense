    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option ANALYZE_SAMPLE is performance-sensitive. The code context provided shows that the configuration involves analyzing tables, which can be time-expensive and memory-expensive operations. The operation of analyzing tables can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, especially when it involves locking, iterating through tables, and opening new transactions. These operations directly and substantially affect system performance, making the configuration performance-sensitive."
