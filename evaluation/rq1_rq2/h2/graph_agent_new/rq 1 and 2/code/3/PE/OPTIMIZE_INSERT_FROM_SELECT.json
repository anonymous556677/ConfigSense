    "Reason": "The configuration option OPTIMIZE_INSERT_FROM_SELECT is performance-sensitive. This is because the code snippet related to this configuration involves performance-related operations that can significantly impact system performance. The code checks for the optimizeInsertFromSelect setting in the database settings and executes different query paths based on this setting. The configuration directly affects the execution flow of the query and can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, making it performance-sensitive."
