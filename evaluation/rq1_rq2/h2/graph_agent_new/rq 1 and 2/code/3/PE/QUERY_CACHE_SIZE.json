    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option QUERY_CACHE_SIZE is performance-sensitive. The code context shows that the queryCacheSize configuration is being set from the database settings, which indicates that it directly affects the performance of query caching. Query caching can have a significant impact on system performance by reducing the time-expensive operations of executing repetitive queries. Therefore, any changes in the QUERY_CACHE_SIZE configuration can lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
