    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option ESTIMATED_FUNCTION_TABLE_ROWS is performance-sensitive. The code snippet provided shows that the configuration is directly used to calculate the expected number of rows, which in turn affects the cost calculation. The configuration is involved in a performance-related operation (calculating expectedRows) that directly impacts the execution time of the function. Therefore, any changes to this configuration can lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
