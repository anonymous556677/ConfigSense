    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option GET_SORTED_SETTINGS is performance-sensitive. This is because the code context involves iterating over all settings in the database and adding them to the session rows. This operation can be time-expensive and memory-expensive, especially when dealing with a large number of settings. Additionally, the code involves accessing various database settings and store information, which can have a notable performance impact at the system level."
