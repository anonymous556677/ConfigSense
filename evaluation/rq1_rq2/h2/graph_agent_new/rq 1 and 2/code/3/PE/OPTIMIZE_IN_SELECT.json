    "Reason": "The configuration option OPTIMIZE_IN_SELECT is not performance-sensitive based on the provided code context. The configuration setting optimizeInSelect is checked within the code, but it does not involve any performance-intensive operations that would lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The code snippet primarily deals with querying and processing data, but the optimizeInSelect configuration itself does not directly and substantially impact system performance in a significant way."
