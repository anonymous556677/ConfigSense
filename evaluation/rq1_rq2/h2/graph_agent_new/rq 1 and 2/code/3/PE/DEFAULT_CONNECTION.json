    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The DEFAULT_CONNECTION configuration is performance-sensitive. This is because the code context shows that the configuration directly affects system performance at the system level. The code involves operations that are time-expensive, such as creating connections, setting auto commit, and invoking methods with parameters. These operations can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, making the configuration performance-sensitive."
