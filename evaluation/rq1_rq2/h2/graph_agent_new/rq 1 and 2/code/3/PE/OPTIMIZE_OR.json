    "Reason": "The configuration option OPTIMIZE_OR is not performance-sensitive based on the provided code context. The code snippet provided does not contain any performance-related operations that significantly impact system performance at the system level. The optimization operations in the code focus on rearranging expressions and optimizing combinations, but these operations do not lead to notable performance variations. Therefore, the configuration can be classified as not performance-sensitive."
