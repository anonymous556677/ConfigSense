    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option OPTIMIZE_EVALUATABLE_SUBQUERIES is performance-sensitive. This is because the code snippet related to this configuration involves a check for the setting optimizeEvaluatableSubqueries in the session's database settings. If this setting is false, it will return false, which can impact the performance of the system by potentially skipping certain evaluatable subqueries optimizations. This directly affects the system performance at the system level, making it a performance-sensitive configuration."
