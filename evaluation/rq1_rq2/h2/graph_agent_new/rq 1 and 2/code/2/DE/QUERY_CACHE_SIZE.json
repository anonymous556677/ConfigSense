    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The configuration QUERY_CACHE_SIZE determines the size of the query cache in number of cached statements. Each session has its own cache with the specified size. The cache is utilized when the SQL statement and all parameters match, and only the last returned result per query is cached. Various statement types such as SELECT, CALL, DELETE, INSERT, MERGE, UPDATE, and transactional statements are cached.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The configuration QUERY_CACHE_SIZE is triggered whenever a session executes a SQL statement that matches the parameters and conditions for caching. The frequency of triggering depends on the number of queries executed by sessions and the cache hit rate.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the configuration option QUERY_CACHE_SIZE is on the memory usage of the system. Increasing the cache size can improve performance by reducing the need to re-execute queries, but it also consumes more memory. Conversely, reducing the cache size may lead to more frequent query executions but lower memory usage."
