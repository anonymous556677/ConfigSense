    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option DATABASE_TO_LOWER is performance-sensitive. This is because the code context shows that the configuration involves performance-related operations that are time-expensive within its related code. Specifically, the use of StringUtils.toLowerEnglish() method to convert identifiers to lower case based on the database settings can have a notable performance impact at the system level. This operation is memory-expensive and can lead to significant performance variations, making the configuration performance-sensitive."
