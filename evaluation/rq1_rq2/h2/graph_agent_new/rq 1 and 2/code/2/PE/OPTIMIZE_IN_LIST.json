    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option OPTIMIZE_IN_LIST is performance-sensitive. This is because the code context shows that the configuration directly affects the system performance by checking the session's database settings for optimizeInList. Depending on the value of this setting, different index conditions are added, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The configuration-related code contains performance-related operations that are time-expensive and memory-expensive, making it a performance-sensitive configuration."
