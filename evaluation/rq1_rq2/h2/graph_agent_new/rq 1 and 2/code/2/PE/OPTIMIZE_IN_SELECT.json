    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The configuration option OPTIMIZE_IN_SELECT is not performance-sensitive based on the provided code context. The code snippet does not contain any performance-related operations that are time-expensive or memory-expensive. The configuration check for optimizeInSelect is a simple boolean check that does not directly and substantially affect system performance at the system level. Therefore, it does not lead to notable performance variations and should be classified as not performance-sensitive."
