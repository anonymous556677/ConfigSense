    "Reason": "The MAX_QUERY_TIMEOUT configuration option is not performance-sensitive. The code snippet provided does not contain any performance-related operations that are time-expensive or memory-expensive. The configuration simply sets the query timeout to a maximum value if it exceeds a predefined maximum value from the database settings. This operation does not directly and substantially affect system performance at the system level, and therefore does not lead to notable performance variations."
