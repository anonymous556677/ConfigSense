    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'LOB_TIMEOUT' is classified as performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the 'lobTimeout' configuration setting directly impacts the execution time of the 'removeTemporaryLobs' method. The calculation of 'keepYoungerThan' based on 'lobTimeout' involves time-expensive operations (multiplication and subtraction) within the related code, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Additionally, the 'onTimeout' condition further influences the execution flow based on the 'lobTimeout' value, making it a performance-sensitive configuration."
