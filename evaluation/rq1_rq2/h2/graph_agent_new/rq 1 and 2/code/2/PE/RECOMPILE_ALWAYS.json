    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The configuration option RECOMPILE_ALWAYS is not performance-sensitive. The code snippet provided in the context does not contain any performance-related operations that are time-expensive or memory-expensive. The needRecompile method simply checks if the statement needs to be re-compiled based on certain conditions related to database modifications and settings. These conditions do not involve any significant performance impact at the system level, hence the configuration is classified as not performance-sensitive."
