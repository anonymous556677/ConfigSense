    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option ANALYZE_SAMPLE is performance-sensitive. The code context provided shows that the configuration involves analyzing tables, which can have a significant impact on system performance. The operation of analyzing tables can be time-expensive and memory-expensive, especially when dealing with a large number of tables or rows. This can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, making it a performance-sensitive configuration."
