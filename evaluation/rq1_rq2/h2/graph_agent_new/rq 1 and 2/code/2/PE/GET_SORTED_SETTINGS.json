    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option GET_SORTED_SETTINGS is performance-sensitive. The code context shows that this configuration involves performance-related operations such as iterating over database settings and adding them to the session. This operation can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, especially when dealing with a large number of settings. Therefore, the configuration is classified as performance-sensitive."
