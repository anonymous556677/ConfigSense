    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option ESTIMATED_FUNCTION_TABLE_ROWS is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the configuration directly affects the performance of the system at the system level. In the provided code context, the configuration is used to estimate the number of rows in a table, which directly impacts the execution time of the getCost method. The use of this configuration leads to notable performance variations as it involves time-expensive operations like fetching row count approximation and multiplying it by a factor of 10, which can significantly impact the overall performance of the system."
