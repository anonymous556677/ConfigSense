    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option OPTIMIZE_DISTINCT is performance-sensitive. This is because the code snippet related to this configuration involves performance-related operations that are time-expensive and memory-expensive. The optimization process for distinct queries involves checking for selectivity, setting indexes, and sorting data, all of which can have a notable impact on system performance at the system level. Additionally, the configuration directly affects the execution time and memory consumption, leading to significant performance variations."
