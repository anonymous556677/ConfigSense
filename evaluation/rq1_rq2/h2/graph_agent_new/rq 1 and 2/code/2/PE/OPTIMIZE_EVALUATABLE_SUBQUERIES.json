    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'OPTIMIZE_EVALUATABLE_SUBQUERIES' is performance-sensitive. This is because the code snippet related to this configuration involves a check for 'session.getDatabase().getSettings().optimizeEvaluatableSubqueries' which directly impacts the evaluation of subqueries. If this configuration is set to false, it can lead to notable performance variations at the system level by affecting the optimization of evaluatable subqueries, making it a performance-sensitive configuration."
