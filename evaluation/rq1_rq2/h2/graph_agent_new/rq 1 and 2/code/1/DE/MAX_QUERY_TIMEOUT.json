    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The configuration MAX_QUERY_TIMEOUT is used to set the maximum timeout for a query in milliseconds. The code snippet provided ensures that the queryTimeout value does not exceed the maximum value specified in the database settings. If the max value is not 0 and is less than the queryTimeout value or if queryTimeout is 0, then queryTimeout is set to the max value. The cancelAtNs variable is also reset to 0 after setting the queryTimeout.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The configuration is triggered whenever the setQueryTimeout method is called to set the query timeout value. The frequency of triggering depends on how often this method is invoked in the system.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the MAX_QUERY_TIMEOUT configuration option is that it limits the maximum timeout for a query in the system. Setting a lower value for this configuration can potentially improve system performance by preventing queries from running for too long and consuming excessive resources."
