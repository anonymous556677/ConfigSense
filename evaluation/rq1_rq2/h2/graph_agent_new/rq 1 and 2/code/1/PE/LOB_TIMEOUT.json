    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'LOB_TIMEOUT' is performance-sensitive. The code snippet provided shows that the 'LOB_TIMEOUT' configuration is directly used to calculate the 'keepYoungerThan' value, which is then used in a loop to check for timeout conditions. This calculation and loop operation can have a notable impact on system performance, especially if the 'LOB_TIMEOUT' value is set to a large value. Therefore, the configuration directly affects system performance at the system level by introducing time-expensive operations within its related code."
