    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option OPTIMIZE_IN_LIST is performance-sensitive. This is because the code context shows that the OPTIMIZE_IN_LIST configuration directly affects the system performance by checking the session's database settings and executing operations that involve time-expensive and memory-expensive tasks such as adding index conditions based on certain conditions. These operations can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, making the configuration performance-sensitive."
