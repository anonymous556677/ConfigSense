    "Reason": "The configuration option MAX_QUERY_TIMEOUT is not performance-sensitive. The code snippet provided does not contain any performance-related operations that are time-expensive or memory-expensive. The setting of the queryTimeout value based on the maxQueryTimeout value does not lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Therefore, this configuration does not directly and substantially affect system performance in a significant way."
