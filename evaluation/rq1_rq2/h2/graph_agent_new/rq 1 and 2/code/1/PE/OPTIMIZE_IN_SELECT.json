    "Reason": "The configuration option OPTIMIZE_IN_SELECT is not performance-sensitive based on the provided code context. The code snippet related to this configuration does not contain any performance-related operations that are time-expensive or memory-expensive. The configuration check 'session.getDatabase().getSettings().optimizeInSelect' does not directly and substantially affect system performance at the system level, and it does not lead to notable performance variations. Therefore, it is classified as not performance-sensitive."
