    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option RECOMPILE_ALWAYS is performance-sensitive. This is because the needRecompile method involves checking if the statement needs to be re-compiled, which includes operations like comparing modificationMetaId with db.getModificationMetaId() and checking db.getSettings().recompileAlways. These operations are time-expensive and can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, making this configuration performance-sensitive."
