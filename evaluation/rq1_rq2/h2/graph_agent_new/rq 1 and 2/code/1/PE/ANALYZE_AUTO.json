    "Reason": "The configuration option ANALYZE_AUTO does not involve any performance-related operations that are time-expensive or memory-expensive within its related code. The code snippet provided mainly focuses on initializing variables and creating indexes, which do not have a significant impact on system performance. Therefore, the configuration is not considered performance-sensitive."
