    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'OPTIMIZE_DISTINCT' is performance-sensitive. This is because the code snippet related to this configuration involves performance-related operations that are time-expensive and memory-expensive. The 'optimizeExpressionsAndPreserveAliases()' method and the optimization of expressions within the 'else' block contribute to notable performance variations at the system level. Additionally, the optimization of distinct queries based on selectivity and index conditions further emphasizes the performance sensitivity of this configuration."
