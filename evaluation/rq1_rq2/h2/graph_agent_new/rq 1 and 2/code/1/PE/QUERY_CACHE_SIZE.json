    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The configuration option QUERY_CACHE_SIZE is not performance-sensitive based on the provided code context. The code snippet does not show any performance-related operations that are time-expensive or memory-expensive related to the query cache size. The initialization of the queryCacheSize variable does not involve any significant performance impact at the system level. Therefore, it does not lead to notable performance variations and can be classified as non-performance-sensitive."
