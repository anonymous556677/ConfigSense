    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option DATABASE_TO_LOWER is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the configuration directly affects the performance of the system at the system level. The code context shows that the configuration involves performance-related operations that are time-expensive within its related code. Specifically, the use of StringUtils.toLowerEnglish() method to convert strings to lower case based on the database settings. This operation can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, making the configuration performance-sensitive."
