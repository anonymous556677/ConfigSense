    "Reason": "The DEFAULT_CONNECTION configuration option is not performance-sensitive. The code context provided does not contain any performance-related operations that are time-expensive or memory-expensive. The configuration does not directly and substantially affect system performance at the system level, and it does not lead to notable performance variations. Therefore, it can be classified as not performance-sensitive."
