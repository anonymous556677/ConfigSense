    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option ESTIMATED_FUNCTION_TABLE_ROWS is performance-sensitive. The code snippet provided directly accesses the configuration setting database.getSettings().estimatedFunctionTableRows, which can have a substantial impact on the expectedRows calculation. This configuration directly affects the performance of the getCost method by potentially introducing significant performance variations based on the estimated number of function table rows. Therefore, it is classified as performance-sensitive."
