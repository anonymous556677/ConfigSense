Setting a higher timeout value may result in longer database closing times but can prevent premature removal of temporary large objects. On the other hand, setting a lower timeout value may lead to more frequent removal of temporary large objects, potentially improving database performance but also increasing the risk of data loss if objects are removed prematurely."
