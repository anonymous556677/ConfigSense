Each session has its own cache with the specified size. The cache is utilized when the SQL statement and all parameters match, and only the last returned result per query is cached.

Both statements and prepared statements are cached.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The QUERY_CACHE_SIZE configuration is triggered whenever a session executes a query that matches the criteria for caching. The frequency of triggering depends on the number of queries executed by sessions and the matching criteria for caching.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the QUERY_CACHE_SIZE configuration option on the system is significant. It affects the performance and memory usage of the system by determining the size of the query cache for each session. A larger cache size can improve performance by reducing the need to re-execute queries, but it also consumes more memory. On the other hand, a smaller cache size may lead to more frequent query executions but requires less memory. Therefore, the configuration option should be carefully adjusted based on the system's requirements and available resources."
