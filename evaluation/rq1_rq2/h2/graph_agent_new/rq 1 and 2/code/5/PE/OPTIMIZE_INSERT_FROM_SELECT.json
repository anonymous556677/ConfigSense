    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option OPTIMIZE_INSERT_FROM_SELECT is performance-sensitive. This is because the code snippet related to this configuration involves performance-related operations that are time-expensive and memory-expensive. The configuration directly affects system performance at the system level by optimizing insert operations from select statements, which can lead to notable performance variations. The code snippet checks for specific conditions and executes different query paths based on the configuration, impacting the overall execution time and memory consumption significantly."
