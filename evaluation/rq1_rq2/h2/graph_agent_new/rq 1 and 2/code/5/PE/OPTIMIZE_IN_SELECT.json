    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option OPTIMIZE_IN_SELECT is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the OPTIMIZE_IN_SELECT configuration directly affects system performance at the system level. Within the related code context provided, the configuration setting 'optimizeInSelect' is checked before executing certain operations. This check involves time-expensive and memory-expensive operations that can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Therefore, the configuration is considered performance-sensitive."
