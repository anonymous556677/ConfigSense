    "Reason": "The configuration option RECOMPILE_ALWAYS is not performance-sensitive. The code snippet provided in the context does not involve any time-expensive or memory-expensive operations that would lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The needRecompile() method simply checks if the statement needs to be re-compiled based on certain conditions, but these conditions do not directly and substantially affect system performance in a significant way."
