    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option OPTIMIZE_DISTINCT is performance-sensitive. This is because the code snippet related to this configuration involves optimization of expressions and preservation of aliases, which can have a notable impact on system performance. The configuration directly affects the execution time and memory consumption at the system level by optimizing distinct queries based on certain conditions. The presence of time-expensive and memory-expensive operations within the code related to this configuration leads to notable performance variations, making it performance-sensitive."
