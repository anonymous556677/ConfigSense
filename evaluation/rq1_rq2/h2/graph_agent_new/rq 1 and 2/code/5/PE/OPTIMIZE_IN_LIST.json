    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option OPTIMIZE_IN_LIST is performance-sensitive. The code context shows that the configuration setting 'optimizeInList' directly impacts the execution of index conditions based on the value of this setting. When 'optimizeInList' is true, additional index conditions are added based on the valueList, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. This configuration involves performance-related operations that are time-expensive within its related code, making it performance-sensitive."
