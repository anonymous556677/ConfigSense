    "Reason": "The configuration option DEFAULT_ESCAPE is not performance-sensitive. The code context provided does not show any performance-related operations that are time-expensive or memory-expensive. The configuration is simply returning a default escape character and passing it as a parameter in the CompareLike constructor. This operation is not likely to cause notable performance variations at the system level."
