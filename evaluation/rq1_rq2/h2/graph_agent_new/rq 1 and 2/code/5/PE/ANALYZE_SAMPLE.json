    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option ANALYZE_SAMPLE is performance-sensitive. The code context provided shows that the configuration involves performance-related operations such as analyzing tables, which can be time-expensive and memory-expensive. The operation of analyzing tables can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, especially when dealing with a large number of tables and rows. Therefore, this configuration is considered performance-sensitive based on the significant impact it can have on system performance."
