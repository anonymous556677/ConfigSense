    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The DEFAULT_CONNECTION configuration option is performance-sensitive. This is because the code context shows that the configuration involves performance-related operations that are time-expensive, such as creating connections, setting auto commit, and invoking methods with parameters. These operations directly impact system performance at the system level, leading to notable performance variations. Additionally, the configuration-related code includes logic for handling varArgs parameters and default connections, which further contribute to the performance sensitivity of the configuration."
