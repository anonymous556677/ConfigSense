    "Reason": "The MAX_QUERY_TIMEOUT configuration option is not performance-sensitive. The code snippet provided does not involve any performance-related operations that are time-expensive or memory-expensive. The configuration setting only checks if the queryTimeout value exceeds the max value from database settings and sets it accordingly. This operation does not lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
