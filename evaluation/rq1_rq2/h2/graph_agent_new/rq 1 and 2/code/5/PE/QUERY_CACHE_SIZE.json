    "classification_result": "Performance-insensitive with 100% confidence",
    "Reason": "The configuration option QUERY_CACHE_SIZE is related to the size of the query cache, which is used for caching SQL statements. While cache size can impact overall system performance, it is not directly related to time-dependent aspects of system operation or performance-sensitive operations. Therefore, it can be classified as performance-insensitive with 100% confidence."
