    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'LOB_TIMEOUT' is performance-sensitive. The code context shows that the 'LOB_TIMEOUT' configuration is directly used to calculate the 'keepYoungerThan' value, which is then used in a loop to check for timeout conditions. This calculation and loop operation can be time-expensive, especially if the 'lobTimeout' value is large or if the loop iterates over a large number of 'temporaryResultLobs'. This can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, making the configuration performance-sensitive."
