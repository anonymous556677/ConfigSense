{
    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option DATABASE_TO_LOWER is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the configuration involves performance-related operations that are time-extensive within its related code. Specifically, the code snippet in the getValue method checks if the database setting databaseToLower is true and then converts the string to lower case using StringUtils.toLowerEnglish. This operation can have a notable performance impact at the system level, especially when dealing with large datasets or frequent string manipulations. Therefore, the configuration is considered performance-sensitive based on the code context and the potential performance impact it can have on the system."
