    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option ESTIMATED_FUNCTION_TABLE_ROWS is performance-sensitive. The code snippet provided shows that the configuration is directly used to calculate the expected number of rows, which in turn affects the cost calculation. The configuration value is used in a time-expensive operation (multiplication) that directly impacts the execution time of the function. Therefore, any changes in the ESTIMATED_FUNCTION_TABLE_ROWS configuration can lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
