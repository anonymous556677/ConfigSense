    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The MAX_QUERY_TIMEOUT configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly affects system performance at the system level. Setting a maximum timeout for queries can lead to notable performance variations, especially if queries frequently exceed the configured timeout and are terminated prematurely. The code snippet provided also indicates that the configuration involves performance-related operations by checking and setting the query timeout, which can be time-expensive and memory-expensive, further impacting system performance."
