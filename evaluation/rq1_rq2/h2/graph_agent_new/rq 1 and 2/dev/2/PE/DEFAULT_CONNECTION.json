    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The DEFAULT_CONNECTION configuration is classified as performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly impacts system performance by determining whether Java functions can use a default connection, which can significantly affect the execution time and memory consumption at the system level. The configuration involves performance-related operations such as establishing database connections, which are time-expensive and memory-expensive. Therefore, any changes to this configuration can lead to notable performance variations in the system."
