    "Reason": "The configuration option 'DEFAULT_ESCAPE' is not performance-sensitive. The developer's information indicates that this configuration is used to retrieve the default escape character from the database settings, and it is triggered in specific scenarios related to search string escape and comparison operations. The impact of this configuration is limited to the functionality that requires an escape character and does not have a significant impact on the overall system performance. There are no performance-related operations within the configuration code that lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
