    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option RECOMPILE_ALWAYS is performance-sensitive. From the system level perspective, setting RECOMPILE_ALWAYS to true can lead to notable performance variations as it adds overhead to the compilation process for prepared statements. This can impact system performance by increasing execution time and memory consumption. From the configuration-related code perspective, the needRecompile method triggers the configuration whenever a prepared statement is being compiled, dropped, or created based on specific conditions. This indicates that the configuration involves performance-related operations that are time-expensive and can directly affect system performance, making it performance-sensitive."
