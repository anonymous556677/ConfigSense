    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The OPTIMIZE_IN_SELECT configuration option is considered performance-sensitive because it directly affects the performance of queries that involve IN(SELECT ...) comparisons. By optimizing the execution of these operations, it can lead to faster query execution and potentially reduce resource consumption at the system level. Additionally, the configuration involves performance-related operations within its related code, such as SELECT, DELETE, and UPDATE optimizations, which are time-expensive and memory-expensive, leading to notable performance variations."
