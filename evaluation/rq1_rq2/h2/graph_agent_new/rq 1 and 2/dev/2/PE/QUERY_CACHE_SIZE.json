    "Reason": "The QUERY_CACHE_SIZE configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts system performance at the system level. The size of the query cache affects the frequency of re-executing SQL statements, which can lead to notable performance variations. Depending on the cache size set, the system may experience significant changes in memory consumption and execution time. Additionally, the configuration involves performance-related operations within its related code, such as caching and matching SQL statements, which contribute to the overall system performance."
