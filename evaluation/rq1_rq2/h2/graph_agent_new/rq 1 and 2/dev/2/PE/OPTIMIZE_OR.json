    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The OPTIMIZE_OR configuration option is performance-sensitive. This is because the optimization it performs directly impacts query performance by reducing the number of comparisons needed, which can lead to notable performance improvements at the system level. Additionally, the conversion of logical OR operations into an IN clause with multiple values involves performance-related operations that are time-expensive within the code, further emphasizing its performance sensitivity."
