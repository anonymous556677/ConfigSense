    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option ANALYZE_AUTO is performance-sensitive. From the system level perspective, the ANALYZE operation triggered by ANALYZE_AUTO directly impacts the performance of the database by ensuring up-to-date table statistics, which can significantly affect query performance and execution plans. From the configuration-related code perspective, the value of ANALYZE_AUTO determines the frequency of the ANALYZE operation, which can lead to time-expensive operations depending on the workload and data changes in the system. Therefore, the configuration is considered performance-sensitive due to its direct and substantial impact on system performance."
