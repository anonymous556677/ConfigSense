    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The LOB_TIMEOUT configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly affects system performance at the system level. The configuration is used to set the maximum time for compacting a database when closing, which can have a significant impact on the system's performance and resource usage. Depending on the timeout value set, it can lead to notable performance variations by affecting database closing times and the removal of temporary large objects. The frequency of triggering the configuration also plays a role in its performance impact, as it depends on how often the removeTemporaryLobs method is called during system operation."
