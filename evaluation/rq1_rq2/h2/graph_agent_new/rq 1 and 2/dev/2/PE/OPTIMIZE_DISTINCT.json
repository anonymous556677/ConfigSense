    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option OPTIMIZE_DISTINCT is considered performance-sensitive. The developer's information indicates that this configuration is triggered when specific conditions for optimization are met in distinct queries. This optimization involves checking for single column queries without conditions, one table involved, ascending index on the column, and selectivity below 20. These optimization conditions suggest that the configuration involves performance-related operations that can significantly impact query execution time and system efficiency. Therefore, the configuration directly affects system performance at the system level by optimizing distinct queries, making it performance-sensitive."
