    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option ANALYZE_SAMPLE is classified as performance-sensitive. This is because the value of ANALYZE_SAMPLE directly impacts the performance of table analysis by determining the sample size for analysis. Setting a higher value for ANALYZE_SAMPLE can lead to analyzing a larger sample of rows, resulting in increased processing time and resource consumption. Conversely, setting a lower value may speed up the analysis process but with potentially less accurate results. Since the configuration directly affects the execution time and resource consumption of the system-level operation (table analysis), it is considered performance-sensitive."
