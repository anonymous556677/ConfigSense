    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option OPTIMIZE_INSERT_FROM_SELECT is considered performance-sensitive. This is because bypassing temporary disk storage when inserting from a select query directly impacts the system performance significantly. By reducing the overhead of writing and reading from disk, it leads to faster query execution and potentially reduces resource consumption on the system. Additionally, the configuration is triggered whenever an insert from select query is executed, indicating that it directly and substantially affects system performance at the system level."
