    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The configuration option ESTIMATED_FUNCTION_TABLE_ROWS is not performance-sensitive based on the provided information. Although it impacts the optimizer's decision-making process by providing an estimated number of rows in a function table, it does not directly and substantially affect system performance at the system level. The configuration is triggered only when the getCost method is called, which depends on the specific usage of the method in the application. Additionally, the configuration does not involve any time-expensive or memory-expensive operations within its related code that lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
