    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'GET_SORTED_SETTINGS' configuration is performance-sensitive because it retrieves and lists all settings from the database, which can be time-expensive and memory-expensive operations. This configuration directly impacts system performance at the system level, especially if there are a large number of settings in the database. The code context of this configuration involves operations that contribute significantly to execution time and memory consumption, leading to notable performance variations at the system level."
