    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The configuration option DATABASE_TO_LOWER is not performance-sensitive. The conversion to lower case using StringUtils.toLowerEnglish() method is a relatively lightweight operation that has minimal impact on system performance. Although the configuration is checked in multiple places in the code and can impact the readability and consistency of identifiers, it does not directly and substantially affect system performance at the system level. Therefore, it does not lead to notable performance variations and should be classified as not performance-sensitive."
