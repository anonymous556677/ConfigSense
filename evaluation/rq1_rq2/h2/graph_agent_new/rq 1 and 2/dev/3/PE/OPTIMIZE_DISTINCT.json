    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option OPTIMIZE_DISTINCT is performance-sensitive. The developer's information indicates that this configuration directly impacts the performance of distinct queries by optimizing them based on specific conditions. This optimization can lead to faster query execution and potentially reduce resource consumption at the system level. Additionally, the configuration involves performance-related operations within its related code, such as checking for specific conditions and applying optimizations, which can cause notable performance variations. Therefore, based on the provided information and analysis of the configuration-related code, it can be classified as performance-sensitive."
