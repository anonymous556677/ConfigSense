    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'LOB_TIMEOUT' configuration option is performance-sensitive. This is because the timeout value directly impacts the efficiency of removing temporary lobs and compacting the database, which are time-expensive operations. Setting a lower timeout value can lead to more frequent removal of temporary lobs and faster database compaction, resulting in notable performance variations at the system level. Therefore, the configuration directly and substantially affects system performance, making it performance-sensitive."
