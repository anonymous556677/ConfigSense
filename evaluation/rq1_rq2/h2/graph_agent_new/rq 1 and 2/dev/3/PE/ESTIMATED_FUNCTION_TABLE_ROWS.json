    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option ESTIMATED_FUNCTION_TABLE_ROWS is classified as performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly impacts the query optimizer, which plays a crucial role in query planning and execution. By providing an estimated number of rows in a function table, it helps the optimizer make better decisions, potentially leading to improved performance at the system level. Additionally, the configuration is triggered whenever the getCost method is called, which indicates that it is likely to be involved in time-expensive operations related to cost calculations for query optimization."
