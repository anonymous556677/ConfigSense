    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The OPTIMIZE_IN_SELECT configuration option is considered performance-sensitive. This is because enabling this configuration directly impacts the performance of SELECT, DELETE, and UPDATE operations by optimizing the IN(SELECT ...) comparisons. These operations are time-expensive and memory-expensive within the related code, leading to notable performance variations at the system level. The developer's understanding that enabling this configuration can significantly improve query efficiency and execution times further supports the classification of this configuration as performance-sensitive."
