    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'GET_SORTED_SETTINGS' is performance-sensitive. The developer's understanding that the configuration code iterates through all settings in the database and adds them to the session and rows indicates that this operation can be time-expensive and memory-expensive. This can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, especially if the database contains a large number of settings. Therefore, the configuration directly and substantially affects system performance, making it performance-sensitive."
