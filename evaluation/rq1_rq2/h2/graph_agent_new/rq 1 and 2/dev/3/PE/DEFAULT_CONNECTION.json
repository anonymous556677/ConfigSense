    "Reason": "The DEFAULT_CONNECTION configuration option does not directly involve any performance-related operations that are time-extensive or memory-extensive within its related code. The developer's explanation indicates that this configuration simply determines whether Java functions can use a specific method to get a database connection, and the impact on system performance and resource usage is dependent on how frequently Java functions are called that require a database connection. Since the configuration itself does not perform any time-expensive or memory-expensive operations, it is not classified as performance-sensitive."
