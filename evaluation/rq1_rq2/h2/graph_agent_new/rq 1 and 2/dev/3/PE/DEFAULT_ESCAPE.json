    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The DEFAULT_ESCAPE configuration option is not performance-sensitive. The developer's explanation indicates that this configuration is primarily used to determine the escape character for search strings in the system. This configuration does not involve any performance-related operations that are time-expensive or memory-expensive within its related code. It simply retrieves the default escape character from the database settings and returns it as the search string escape character. Since it does not lead to notable performance variations at the system level and does not have a direct and substantial impact on system performance, it is classified as not performance-sensitive."
