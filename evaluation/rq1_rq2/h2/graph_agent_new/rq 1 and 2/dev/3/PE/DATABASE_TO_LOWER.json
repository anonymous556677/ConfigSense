    "Reason": "The configuration option DATABASE_TO_LOWER is not performance-sensitive based on the provided information. The developer mentioned that the impact of this configuration on system performance is minimal, adding only a small overhead to the processing of identifiers. The configuration is checked in multiple places in the code, but the conversion to lower case using StringUtils.toLowerEnglish() method does not lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Therefore, the configuration does not directly and substantially affect system performance, making it non-performance-sensitive."
