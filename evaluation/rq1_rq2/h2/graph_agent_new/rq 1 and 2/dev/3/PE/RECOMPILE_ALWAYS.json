    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The RECOMPILE_ALWAYS configuration option is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts system performance at the system level. The needRecompile method checks if the statement needs to be re-compiled based on this configuration option, which can lead to notable performance variations. Additionally, the configuration can potentially increase the overhead of statement compilation, leading to increased CPU usage and potentially slower performance."
