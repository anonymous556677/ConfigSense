    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option OPTIMIZE_INSERT_FROM_SELECT is performance-sensitive. This is because bypassing temporary disk storage for insert from select queries directly impacts system performance by improving efficiency and potentially reducing disk usage. The code context related to this configuration involves time-expensive and memory-expensive operations that lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Therefore, the configuration directly and substantially affects system performance, making it performance-sensitive."
