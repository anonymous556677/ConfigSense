    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'ANALYZE_AUTO' configuration is considered performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the performance and optimization of the database system at the system level. The frequency at which the ANALYZE operation is automatically run for a table based on the number of row changes specified in the configuration value can lead to notable performance variations. The time-expensive operation of running ANALYZE too frequently can impact system performance, making it crucial to set the configuration value appropriately to avoid performance degradation. Therefore, the 'ANALYZE_AUTO' configuration is classified as performance-sensitive."
