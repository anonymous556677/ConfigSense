    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The ANALYZE_SAMPLE configuration option, which determines the sample size used when analyzing a table, does not directly and substantially affect system performance at the system level. While a larger sample size may impact the time and resources required for the analysis process, it does not lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The configuration-related code context provided by the developer also does not indicate any time-expensive or memory-expensive operations that would classify this configuration as performance-sensitive."
