    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The MAX_QUERY_TIMEOUT configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly affects system performance by setting the maximum timeout for queries. The code snippet provided shows that the configuration is triggered whenever the setQueryTimeout method is called, indicating that it plays a crucial role in determining query execution time. Setting a lower value for MAX_QUERY_TIMEOUT may lead to queries timing out prematurely, impacting system performance negatively. On the other hand, setting a higher value may increase the time taken for queries to complete, affecting system performance as well. Therefore, the MAX_QUERY_TIMEOUT configuration can result in notable performance variations at the system level, making it performance-sensitive."
