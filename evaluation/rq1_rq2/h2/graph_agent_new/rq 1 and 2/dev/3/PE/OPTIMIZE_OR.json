    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The OPTIMIZE_OR configuration is considered performance-sensitive because it directly impacts system performance at the system level. By converting the OR condition to an IN condition, it potentially reduces the number of comparisons needed, leading to faster execution of queries. This optimization can result in notable performance improvements, making it a performance-sensitive configuration."
