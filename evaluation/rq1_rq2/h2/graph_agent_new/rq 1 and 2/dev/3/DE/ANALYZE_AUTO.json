    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The configuration 'ANALYZE_AUTO' is used to determine the frequency at which the ANALYZE operation is automatically run for a table after a certain number of row changes. The value of 'ANALYZE_AUTO' is retrieved from the database settings and stored in the 'nextAnalyze' variable.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The triggering frequency of the 'ANALYZE_AUTO' configuration is based on the number of row changes specified in the configuration value. For example, if 'ANALYZE_AUTO' is set to 1000, ANALYZE will run after about 1000 changes to a table. The time between running ANALYZE doubles each time since starting the database.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the 'ANALYZE_AUTO' configuration option is that it affects the performance and optimization of the database. By automatically running ANALYZE at specified intervals, the database can ensure that the query optimizer has up-to-date statistics for query planning and execution. However, running ANALYZE too frequently can impact system performance, so it is important to set the configuration value appropriately based on the workload and data changes in the system."
