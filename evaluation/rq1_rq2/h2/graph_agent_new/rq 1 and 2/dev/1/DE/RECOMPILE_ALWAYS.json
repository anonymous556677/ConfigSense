    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The configuration option RECOMPILE_ALWAYS is used in the needRecompile() method to determine if a statement needs to be re-compiled. It checks if the prepareAlways flag is set to true or if the modificationMetaId is less than the database's modificationMetaId or if the database's recompileAlways setting is true.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The RECOMPILE_ALWAYS configuration is triggered whenever a statement needs to be compiled. This can happen multiple times during the execution of the system, depending on the frequency of statement compilation.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of setting RECOMPILE_ALWAYS to true is that prepared statements will always be recompiled, which can potentially increase the system's resource usage and execution time. This may be necessary in certain scenarios where statement freshness is critical, but it can also lead to performance overhead."
