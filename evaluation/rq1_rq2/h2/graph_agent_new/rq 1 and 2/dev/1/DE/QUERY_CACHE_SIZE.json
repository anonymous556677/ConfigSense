The cache is used to store the last returned result per query if the SQL statement and all parameters match. Various types of statements are cached including SELECT, CALL, DELETE, INSERT, MERGE, UPDATE, and transactional statements like COMMIT.",

A larger cache size will consume more memory but can potentially improve performance by reducing the need to re-execute queries. However, a very large cache size can also lead to increased memory usage and potential cache thrashing."
