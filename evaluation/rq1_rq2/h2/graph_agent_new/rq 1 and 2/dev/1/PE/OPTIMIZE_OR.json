    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The OPTIMIZE_OR configuration option is classified as performance-sensitive. This is because the optimization it provides directly impacts the performance of the system at the system level by potentially improving query execution efficiency. The conversion of logical OR operations to an IN operation can lead to significant performance variations in terms of execution time and memory consumption. Additionally, the triggering frequency of this configuration option depends on the frequency of OR operations in the code, indicating that it can have a notable impact on overall system performance."
