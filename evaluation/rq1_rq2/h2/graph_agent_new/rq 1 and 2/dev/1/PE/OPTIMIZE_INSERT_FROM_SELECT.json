    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration OPTIMIZE_INSERT_FROM_SELECT is classified as performance-sensitive. This is because enabling this configuration directly impacts system performance by bypassing temporary disk storage, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The code context also indicates that certain conditions are checked before performing the optimization, suggesting that there are time-expensive and memory-expensive operations involved in the configuration-related code. Therefore, the configuration is considered performance-sensitive due to its substantial effect on system performance and resource usage."
