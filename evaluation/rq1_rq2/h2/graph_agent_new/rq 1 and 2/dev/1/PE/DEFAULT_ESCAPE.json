    "Reason": "The DEFAULT_ESCAPE configuration option is not performance-sensitive. The developer's information indicates that this configuration is used to set the search string escape character, which does not involve any time-expensive or memory-expensive operations. Additionally, the impact of this configuration is limited to determining the escape character for search strings in the system, which does not lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
