    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option OPTIMIZE_IN_SELECT is considered performance-sensitive because it directly affects system performance by optimizing comparison operations involving IN(SELECT ...) queries. This optimization can lead to notable performance improvements in terms of execution time and overall system efficiency. The configuration involves performance-related operations that are time-expensive within its related code, leading to significant performance variations at the system level."
