    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The configuration OPTIMIZE_DISTINCT is not considered performance-sensitive based on the provided information. Although it aims to optimize distinct queries by applying specific conditions, such as single column query without condition, one table involved, ascending index on the column, and selectivity below 20, the optimization criteria do not involve time-expensive or memory-expensive operations that would lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The developer's explanation also indicates that the impact of this configuration is to improve the performance of distinct queries by reducing execution time and resource usage, which suggests a more efficient system operation rather than significant performance variations."
