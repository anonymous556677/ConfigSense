    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option RECOMPILE_ALWAYS is considered performance-sensitive. From the system level perspective, setting RECOMPILE_ALWAYS to true can lead to notable performance variations due to the increased resource usage and execution time caused by the frequent recompilation of prepared statements. This directly and substantially affects system performance. From the configuration-related code perspective, the needRecompile() method checks for the RECOMPILE_ALWAYS flag to determine if a statement needs to be re-compiled. This involves time-expensive operations that contribute to significant performance impact, making the configuration performance-sensitive."
