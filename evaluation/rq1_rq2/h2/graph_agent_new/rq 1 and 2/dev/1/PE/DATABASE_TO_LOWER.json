    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option DATABASE_TO_LOWER is performance-sensitive. This is because enabling the setting incurs additional processing overhead to convert identifiers to lower case, which can impact the overall performance of the system, especially in scenarios where a large number of identifiers need to be converted. This directly affects system performance at the system level by introducing time-expensive operations within the related code, leading to notable performance variations."
