    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option ANALYZE_SAMPLE is performance-sensitive. This is because the sample size directly impacts the efficiency and accuracy of table analysis, which in turn affects the performance and resource utilization during table analysis operations at the system level. The code context also indicates that the configuration is accessed through the session object and is used in the analyzeTables method, suggesting that it involves performance-related operations that can be time-expensive and memory-expensive, leading to notable performance variations."
