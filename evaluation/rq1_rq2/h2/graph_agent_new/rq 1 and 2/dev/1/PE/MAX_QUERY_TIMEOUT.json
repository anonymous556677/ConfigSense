    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The MAX_QUERY_TIMEOUT configuration is performance-sensitive. The configuration directly affects system performance by limiting the maximum timeout for a query. This can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, as queries may be terminated prematurely if they exceed the configured timeout. Additionally, the code snippet provided checks for the configured maximum timeout and adjusts the query timeout accordingly, indicating that the configuration involves time-expensive operations within its related code."
