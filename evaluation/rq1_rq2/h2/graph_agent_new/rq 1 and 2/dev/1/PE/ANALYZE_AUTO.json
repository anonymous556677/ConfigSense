    "Reason": "The 'ANALYZE_AUTO' configuration option is not performance-sensitive based on the provided information. Although it involves running the ANALYZE operation after a certain number of changes to a table, the impact on system performance is not substantial. The triggering frequency is based on the number of changes made to the table, which may not directly lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The code snippet provided focuses on retrieving and assigning values without involving time-expensive or memory-expensive operations that could significantly impact performance. Therefore, the configuration is not classified as performance-sensitive."
