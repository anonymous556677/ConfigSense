    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The DEFAULT_CONNECTION configuration option does not directly involve any performance-related operations that are time-expensive or memory-expensive within its related code. While it may impact the system behavior by enabling a specific way of obtaining a database connection, it does not lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Therefore, it is classified as not performance-sensitive."
