    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'ESTIMATED_FUNCTION_TABLE_ROWS' configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts query optimization and execution plans in the system. The configuration is triggered frequently whenever the method 'getCost' is called, indicating its importance in the system flow. Additionally, the configuration involves estimating the number of rows in a function table, which can have a significant impact on performance at the system level, especially in terms of query processing efficiency. Therefore, the configuration is considered performance-sensitive based on its direct and substantial effect on system performance."
