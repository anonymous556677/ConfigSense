    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'GET_SORTED_SETTINGS' is performance-sensitive. The code iterates over all settings in the database and retrieves their values, which can be time-expensive and memory-expensive operations. Additionally, the configuration includes additional system information like build ID, version, Java properties, database settings, and file store information, which can further impact performance. This configuration directly and substantially affects system performance at the system level by gathering and displaying various settings and system information, leading to notable performance variations."
