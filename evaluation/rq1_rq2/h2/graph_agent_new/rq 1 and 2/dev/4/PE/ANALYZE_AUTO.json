    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The 'ANALYZE_AUTO' configuration option is not classified as performance-sensitive. Although it involves performance-related operations such as running the ANALYZE operation on the table after a certain number of row changes, the impact on system performance is not substantial enough to cause notable performance variations at the system level. The configuration is designed to optimize the table and improve query performance, which is beneficial for system efficiency. However, the potential overhead on system resources from running ANALYZE too frequently does not lead to significant performance variations that would classify it as performance-sensitive."
