    "Reason": "The DEFAULT_CONNECTION configuration does not directly and substantially affect system performance at the system level. The configuration is mainly related to simplifying the process of obtaining a database connection in Java functions. While it may have some impact on the execution time of those functions, it does not lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The code snippet provided by the developer also does not show any time-expensive or memory-expensive operations related to this configuration."
