    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'GET_SORTED_SETTINGS' is performance-sensitive because it involves retrieving settings from the database and adding them to the session and rows. This process includes settings related to the database, store, file system, cache, time zone, and more, which can have a direct and substantial impact on system performance. Additionally, the triggering frequency of the configuration code depends on how often metadata queries are made in the system, indicating that it can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The size impact of the configuration option on the metadata generated for various types of information further supports its performance sensitivity."
