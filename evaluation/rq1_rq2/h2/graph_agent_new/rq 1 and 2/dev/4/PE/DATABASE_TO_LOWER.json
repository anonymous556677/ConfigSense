    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The configuration option DATABASE_TO_LOWER is not performance-sensitive. The conversion to lower case using StringUtils.toLowerEnglish() method is a simple operation that has a relatively small impact on system performance. While the configuration is checked in multiple places in the code, the operation itself is not time-expensive or memory-expensive, and it does not lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Therefore, the configuration can be considered as having a trivial performance impact and should not be classified as performance-sensitive."
