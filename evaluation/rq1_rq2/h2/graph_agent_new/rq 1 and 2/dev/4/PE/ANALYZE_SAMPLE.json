    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The ANALYZE_SAMPLE configuration option is performance-sensitive because it directly affects the efficiency of the analysis process at the system level. By determining the sample size used when analyzing tables, it can significantly impact the execution time and memory consumption of the analysis operation. The code context indicates that this configuration is crucial for the accuracy of the analysis, and any changes to the sample size can lead to notable performance variations in the system."
