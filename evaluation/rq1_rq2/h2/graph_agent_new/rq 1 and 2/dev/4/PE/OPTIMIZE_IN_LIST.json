    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The OPTIMIZE_IN_LIST configuration is classified as performance-sensitive. This is because it directly impacts the performance of SELECT, DELETE, and UPDATE operations by optimizing the use of IN(...) and IN(SELECT ...) comparisons. These optimizations can lead to notable performance improvements at the system level, making it a critical configuration for enhancing overall system performance. Additionally, the configuration is triggered based on a specific condition, indicating its importance in improving performance when the condition is met."
