    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The OPTIMIZE_OR configuration is performance-sensitive. This is because the optimization it provides by converting (C=? OR C=?) expressions to (C IN(?, ?)) expressions can have a significant impact on query performance and efficiency at the system level. By reducing the complexity and cost of evaluating OR conditions, it can lead to notable performance variations. Additionally, the developer's explanation indicates that this configuration involves performance-related operations that are time-expensive within its related code, making it a performance-sensitive configuration."
