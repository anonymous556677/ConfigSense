    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option OPTIMIZE_INSERT_FROM_SELECT is performance-sensitive. This is because the setting directly impacts the performance of insert operations from select queries by bypassing temporary disk storage. This optimization can lead to faster execution of insert operations and potentially reduce disk I/O operations, resulting in notable performance variations at the system level. The configuration involves performance-related operations that are time-expensive (avoiding temporary disk storage) and memory-expensive (reducing disk I/O operations), which directly and substantially affect system performance."
