    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'ESTIMATED_FUNCTION_TABLE_ROWS' is considered performance-sensitive. This is because the estimated number of rows in a function table directly impacts the query optimization process, which can have a significant effect on system performance. The configuration is triggered frequently whenever the method 'getCost' is called, indicating its importance in the system. Additionally, the size impact of this configuration on the optimizer further emphasizes its performance sensitivity, as it plays a crucial role in optimizing query execution based on the estimated row count."
