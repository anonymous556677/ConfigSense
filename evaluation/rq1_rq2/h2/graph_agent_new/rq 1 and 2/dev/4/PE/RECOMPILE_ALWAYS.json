    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The RECOMPILE_ALWAYS configuration option is performance-sensitive. This is because enabling this option can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The configuration involves recompiling prepared statements always, which can result in increased CPU and memory usage. This can impact the execution time of queries and potentially slow down the system. The needRecompile method in the configuration-related code triggers this operation whenever certain conditions are met, indicating that it involves time-expensive and memory-expensive operations that directly affect system performance."
