    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The OPTIMIZE_DISTINCT configuration is considered performance-sensitive because it directly affects the performance of distinct queries at the system level. The configuration involves specific optimization criteria that can significantly impact the execution time of distinct queries that meet the specified conditions. By optimizing the distinct queries based on the configuration settings, it can lead to notable performance improvements in terms of query execution time. Therefore, the configuration is classified as performance-sensitive based on its direct and substantial impact on system performance."
