    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The LOB_TIMEOUT configuration is considered performance-sensitive because it directly affects the efficiency of database compaction when closing, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The configuration involves time-expensive operations related to setting a threshold for removing temporary lobs based on a timeout value. Depending on the timeout value set, it can significantly impact the execution time and memory consumption during database closing operations, making it a critical factor in system performance."
