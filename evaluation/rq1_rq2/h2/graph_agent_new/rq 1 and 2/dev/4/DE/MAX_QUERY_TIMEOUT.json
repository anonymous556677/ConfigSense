    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The configuration MAX_QUERY_TIMEOUT is used to set the maximum timeout for a query in milliseconds. The code snippet provided shows that the setQueryTimeout method checks if the specified queryTimeout value is within the maximum limit set in the database settings. If the specified value exceeds the maximum or is 0, it is adjusted to the maximum value. The queryTimeout value is then stored and a cancelAtNs variable is reset.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The triggering frequency of the MAX_QUERY_TIMEOUT configuration depends on how often the setQueryTimeout method is called in the system. If this method is called frequently to set query timeouts, then the configuration will be triggered accordingly.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the MAX_QUERY_TIMEOUT configuration option is that it enforces a maximum timeout for queries in the system. This can help in preventing long-running queries from consuming excessive resources and potentially causing performance issues. However, setting a lower timeout value may also impact the execution of certain queries that require more time to complete."
