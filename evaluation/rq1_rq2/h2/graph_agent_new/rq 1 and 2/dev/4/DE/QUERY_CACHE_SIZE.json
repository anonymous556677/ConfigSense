    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The QUERY_CACHE_SIZE configuration is used to determine the size of the query cache in the system. Each session has its own cache with the specified size. The cache is utilized when the SQL statement and all parameters match, and only the last returned result per query is cached. Various types of statements are cached, including SELECT, CALL, DELETE, INSERT, MERGE, UPDATE, and transactional statements like COMMIT.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The triggering frequency of the QUERY_CACHE_SIZE configuration depends on the number of cached statements and the frequency of query executions in the system. The configuration is triggered whenever a query is executed and matches the criteria for caching.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the QUERY_CACHE_SIZE configuration on the system is significant. A larger cache size can improve query performance by reducing the need to re-execute queries that have been cached. However, it can also consume more memory resources, especially if the cache size is set too high. Therefore, it is important to balance the cache size based on the system's requirements and available resources."
