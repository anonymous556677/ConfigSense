    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The ANALYZE_SAMPLE configuration option is performance-sensitive because it directly affects the performance of table analysis at the system level. The sample size determined by this configuration impacts the accuracy and performance of table analysis. Changing the value can lead to notable performance variations in terms of execution time and memory consumption. Additionally, the configuration involves performance-related operations in the code, such as sampling rows for analysis, which are time-expensive and memory-expensive. Therefore, the ANALYZE_SAMPLE configuration is considered performance-sensitive."
