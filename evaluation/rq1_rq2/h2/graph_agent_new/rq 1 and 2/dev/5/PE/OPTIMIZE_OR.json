    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The OPTIMIZE_OR configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts system performance by optimizing OR conditions and converting them into more efficient IN clauses. This optimization can lead to faster query execution and reduced resource consumption, which are significant performance improvements at the system level. Additionally, the conversion of OR conditions to IN clauses involves performance-related operations that are time-expensive, making this configuration performance-sensitive."
