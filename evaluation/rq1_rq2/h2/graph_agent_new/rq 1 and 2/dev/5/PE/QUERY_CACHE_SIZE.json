    "classification_result": "Performance-insensitive with 100% confidence",
    "Reason": "The configuration option QUERY_CACHE_SIZE is related to the size of the query cache, which is used for caching SQL statements and their results. While the cache size may impact memory usage, it does not directly affect system performance in terms of time-dependent operations or critical system functions. Therefore, it can be classified as performance-insensitive with 100% confidence."
