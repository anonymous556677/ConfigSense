    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option OPTIMIZE_IN_LIST is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the setting directly impacts the performance of queries involving IN(...) and IN(SELECT ...) comparisons by optimizing them with index conditions. This optimization can lead to notable performance improvements at the system level by reducing query execution times and resource usage. Therefore, the configuration is considered performance-sensitive based on its direct and substantial impact on system performance."
