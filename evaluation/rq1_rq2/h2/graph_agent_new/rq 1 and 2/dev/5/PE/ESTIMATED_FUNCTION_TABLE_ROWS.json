    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'ESTIMATED_FUNCTION_TABLE_ROWS' configuration option is classified as performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly impacts the optimizer's query plans based on the estimated number of rows in a function table. The optimizer's behavior can significantly affect the system's performance at the system level, leading to notable performance variations. Additionally, the configuration involves performance-related operations within its related code that are time-expensive and memory-expensive, further contributing to its performance sensitivity."
