    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The DEFAULT_ESCAPE configuration option does not directly involve any performance-related operations that are time-extensive or memory-extensive within its related code. It simply determines the escape character used for search strings, which may affect search operations behavior but does not lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Therefore, it is classified as not performance-sensitive."
