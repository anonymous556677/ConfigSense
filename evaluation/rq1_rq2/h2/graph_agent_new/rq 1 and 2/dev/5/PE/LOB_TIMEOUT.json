    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'LOB_TIMEOUT' configuration is considered performance-sensitive. This is because the setting of the timeout value directly impacts the efficiency of database closing operations, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The code snippet related to this configuration involves time-expensive operations such as compacting the database when closing, which can significantly affect execution time. Therefore, any changes to the 'LOB_TIMEOUT' value can have a substantial impact on system performance."
