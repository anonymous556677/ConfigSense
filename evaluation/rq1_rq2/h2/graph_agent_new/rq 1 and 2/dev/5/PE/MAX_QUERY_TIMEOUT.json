    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The MAX_QUERY_TIMEOUT configuration is considered performance-sensitive because it directly impacts system performance by enforcing a maximum timeout for queries. This can prevent long-running queries from consuming excessive resources and causing performance issues. The setQueryTimeout method, which is related to this configuration, involves time-expensive operations by checking and adjusting the specified query timeout. If the timeout exceeds the maximum allowed value or is set to 0, it is adjusted accordingly. This can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, making the configuration performance-sensitive."
