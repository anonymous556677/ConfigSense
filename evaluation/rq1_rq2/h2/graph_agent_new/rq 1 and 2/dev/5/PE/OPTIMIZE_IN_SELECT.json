    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The OPTIMIZE_IN_SELECT configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly affects system performance by optimizing comparison operations involving the use of IN(SELECT ...) queries. This optimization can lead to faster query execution and improved overall system performance. The configuration involves performance-related operations that are time-expensive within its related code, leading to notable performance variations at the system level."
