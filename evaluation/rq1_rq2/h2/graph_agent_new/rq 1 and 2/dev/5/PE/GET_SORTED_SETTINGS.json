    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'GET_SORTED_SETTINGS' is classified as performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the configuration involves retrieving all settings from the database and adding them to the session and rows, which can impact memory consumption and processing time. Additionally, the configuration is triggered whenever the settings method is called, potentially leading to frequent performance variations at the system level. The size impact of the configuration option further supports its performance sensitivity, as it can affect the overall system performance significantly."
