    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option OPTIMIZE_INSERT_FROM_SELECT is performance-sensitive. The setting directly impacts the efficiency of insert operations from select queries by bypassing temporary disk storage, which can lead to faster query execution and potentially better overall system performance. This optimization involves time-expensive operations within the related code, resulting in notable performance variations at the system level."
