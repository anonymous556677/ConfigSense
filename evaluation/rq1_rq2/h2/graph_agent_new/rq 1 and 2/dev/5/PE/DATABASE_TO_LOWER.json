    "Reason": "The configuration option DATABASE_TO_LOWER does not directly and substantially affect system performance at the system level. Although it involves some performance-related operations by converting identifiers to lower case using StringUtils.toLowerEnglish() method, the impact on performance is not significant enough to cause notable performance variations. The configuration mainly affects the size and readability of identifiers, rather than causing time-expensive or memory-expensive operations that lead to substantial performance impacts."
