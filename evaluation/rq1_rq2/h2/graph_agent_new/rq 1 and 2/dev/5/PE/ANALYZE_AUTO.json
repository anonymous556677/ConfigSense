    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The 'ANALYZE_AUTO' configuration option is not performance-sensitive. Although it involves running the ANALYZE operation on a table after a certain number of row changes, the operation itself is not time-expensive or memory-expensive. The configuration mainly focuses on maintaining table statistics for query optimization, which does not directly and substantially affect system performance at the system level. Therefore, the configuration is considered to have a trivial performance impact and is not classified as performance-sensitive."
