    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option OPTIMIZE_DISTINCT is classified as performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly impacts the performance of distinct queries by applying optimizations based on specific conditions. The code related to this configuration involves performance-related operations that can significantly improve query execution time and reduce resource consumption for qualifying distinct queries. As a result, the configuration leads to notable performance variations at the system level, making it performance-sensitive."
