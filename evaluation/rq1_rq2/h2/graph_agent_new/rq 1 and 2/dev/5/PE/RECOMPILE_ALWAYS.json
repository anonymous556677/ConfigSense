    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option RECOMPILE_ALWAYS is performance-sensitive. From the system level perspective, the need to recompile statements every time can lead to increased compilation overhead and potentially slower performance. From the configuration-related code perspective, the presence of this option directly impacts the execution time and memory consumption by triggering recompilation whenever certain conditions are met, which can cause notable performance variations at the system level."
