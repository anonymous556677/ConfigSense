    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The configuration QUERY_CACHE_SIZE determines the size of the query cache in number of cached statements. Each session has its own cache with the specified size. The cache is utilized when the SQL statement and all parameters match, caching only the last returned result per query. Various statement types are cached, including SELECT statements (excluding UNION and FOR UPDATE statements), CALL if it returns a single value, DELETE, INSERT, MERGE, UPDATE, and transactional statements like COMMIT. Both statements and prepared statements are cached.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The configuration QUERY_CACHE_SIZE is triggered whenever a session is created and the query cache is initialized with the specified size. The frequency of triggering depends on the number of sessions created and the usage of cached statements in the system.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the configuration option QUERY_CACHE_SIZE is significant in terms of memory usage and query performance. A larger cache size can improve performance by reducing the need to re-execute similar queries, but it also consumes more memory. On the other hand, a smaller cache size may lead to more frequent query executions but with lower memory overhead. Therefore, the optimal size of the query cache should be determined based on the system's requirements and available resources."
