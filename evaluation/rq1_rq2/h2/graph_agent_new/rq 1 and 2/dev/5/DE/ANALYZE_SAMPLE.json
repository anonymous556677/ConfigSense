    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The configuration code retrieves the value of the ANALYZE_SAMPLE setting from the database settings and assigns it to the sampleRows variable in the Analyze constructor. The value is then used to calculate the rowCount in the analyzeTables method when analyzing tables.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The configuration is triggered when the analyzeTables method is called and the tablesToAnalyze is not null and the current thread holds the lock. This indicates that the configuration is triggered when there are tables to analyze and the method is called with proper locking.",

The default value is 10000, which determines the number of rows to be sampled during table analysis. Changing this configuration can affect the accuracy and performance of table analysis in the system."
