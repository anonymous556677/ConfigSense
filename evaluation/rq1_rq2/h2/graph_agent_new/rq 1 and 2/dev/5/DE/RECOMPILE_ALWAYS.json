    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The configuration option RECOMPILE_ALWAYS is used in the needRecompile method to determine if a statement needs to be re-compiled. It checks if the database is closed, if prepareAlways is true, if the modificationMetaId is less than the database's modificationMetaId, or if the database's settings include recompileAlways.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The configuration option RECOMPILE_ALWAYS is triggered whenever a statement needs to be re-compiled, which can happen when the database is closed, when prepareAlways is true, when the modificationMetaId is less than the database's modificationMetaId, or when the database's settings include recompileAlways.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the RECOMPILE_ALWAYS configuration option is that it ensures that prepared statements are always recompiled, which may lead to increased compilation overhead and potentially slower performance due to the need for recompilation on every execution."
