    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The configuration MAX_QUERY_TIMEOUT is used to set the maximum timeout for a query in milliseconds. The code snippet provided shows that the setQueryTimeout method checks if the specified query timeout is within the maximum allowed value. If the specified timeout exceeds the maximum or is set to 0, it is adjusted to the maximum value. The query timeout is then set and a cancelAtNs variable is reset.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The triggering frequency of the MAX_QUERY_TIMEOUT configuration depends on how often the setQueryTimeout method is called in the system. If there are frequent calls to setQueryTimeout with different timeout values, the configuration will be triggered more often.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the MAX_QUERY_TIMEOUT configuration option is that it enforces a maximum timeout for queries in the system. This can help prevent long-running queries from consuming excessive resources and potentially causing performance issues. By setting a maximum timeout, the system can better manage query execution times and resource utilization."
