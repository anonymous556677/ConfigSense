    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option ANALYZE_SAMPLE is performance-sensitive. The code context provided shows that the ANALYZE_SAMPLE configuration directly affects the performance of the system by determining the sample size for table analysis. The analyzeTable method uses the ANALYZE_SAMPLE setting to calculate selectivity for each column based on a sample of rows, which can have a notable performance impact on the system level. Therefore, the configuration is classified as performance-sensitive."
