{
    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option DATABASE_TO_LOWER is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the configuration involves performance-related operations within its related code. Specifically, the code snippet in the getValue method checks if the databaseToLower setting is enabled and then converts strings to lower case using StringUtils.toLowerEnglish method. This conversion operation can be time-expensive and memory-expensive, especially when dealing with large amounts of data. As a result, enabling the databaseToLower setting can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, making this configuration performance-sensitive."
