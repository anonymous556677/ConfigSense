    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option RECOMPILE_ALWAYS is performance-sensitive. The needRecompile() method contains performance-related operations such as accessing the database object and checking for modification meta ID, which can be time-expensive. These operations can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, especially if the database settings require recompilation always. Therefore, the configuration directly and substantially affects system performance, making it performance-sensitive."
