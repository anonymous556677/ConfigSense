{
    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option OPTIMIZE_DISTINCT is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the configuration involves optimizing expressions and preserving aliases, which can have a notable performance impact at the system level. The code context provided shows that the optimization process involves iterating through expressions and applying optimizations, which can be time-expensive and memory-expensive. Additionally, the optimization is triggered in specific conditions, similar to the conditions mentioned in the configuration setting, indicating a direct and substantial effect on system performance."
