    "Reason": "The configuration option ANALYZE_AUTO is not performance-sensitive based on the provided code context. The configuration involves setting the nextAnalyze value from database settings, which does not involve any time-expensive or memory-expensive operations. The code snippet provided does not show any performance-related operations that would lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Therefore, the configuration is classified as not performance-sensitive."
