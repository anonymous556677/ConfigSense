    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'LOB_TIMEOUT' is performance-sensitive. The code snippet provided shows that the 'LOB_TIMEOUT' configuration is directly used to calculate the 'keepYoungerThan' value, which is then used in a loop to check for timeout conditions on 'temporaryResultLobs'. This calculation and usage of 'LOB_TIMEOUT' directly impact the execution time of the 'removeTemporaryLobs' method, leading to notable performance variations at the system level. Therefore, the 'LOB_TIMEOUT' configuration is considered performance-sensitive."
