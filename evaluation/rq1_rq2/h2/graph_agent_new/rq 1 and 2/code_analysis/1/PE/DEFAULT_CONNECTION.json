    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The DEFAULT_CONNECTION configuration option is not performance-sensitive based on the provided code context. The code snippet related to the configuration does not contain any performance-intensive operations that would lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The configuration mainly involves setting up parameters for method invocation and managing session-related operations, which do not directly and substantially impact system performance. Therefore, the DEFAULT_CONNECTION configuration can be classified as not performance-sensitive."
