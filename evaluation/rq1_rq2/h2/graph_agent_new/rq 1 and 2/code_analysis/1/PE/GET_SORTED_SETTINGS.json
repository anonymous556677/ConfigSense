    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option GET_SORTED_SETTINGS is performance-sensitive. The code context shows that the method 'generateRows' retrieves and processes a large amount of data related to database settings and other system information. This operation involves multiple iterations over database settings, sessions, tables, and other objects, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Additionally, the method 'listSettings' also indicates that the configuration involves listing settings, which can impact performance if the settings retrieval process is time-expensive or memory-expensive."
