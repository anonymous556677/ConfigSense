    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option OPTIMIZE_INSERT_FROM_SELECT is performance-sensitive. The code context provided shows that when the configuration setting is enabled (db.getSettings().optimizeInsertFromSelect), it triggers specific code paths that involve multiple performance-related operations such as querying, result manipulation, and distinct handling. These operations can have a notable impact on system performance, especially when dealing with large datasets and complex queries. Therefore, the configuration directly and substantially affects system performance at the system level, making it performance-sensitive."
