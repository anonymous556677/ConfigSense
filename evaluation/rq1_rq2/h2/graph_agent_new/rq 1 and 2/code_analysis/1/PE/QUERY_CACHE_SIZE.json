    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The configuration option QUERY_CACHE_SIZE is not performance-sensitive based on the provided code context. The code snippet does not show any performance-related operations that are time-expensive or memory-expensive. The queryCacheSize is simply being assigned a value from the database settings without any indication of significant performance impact at the system level. Therefore, the configuration is classified as not performance-sensitive."
