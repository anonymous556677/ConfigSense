    "Reason": "The configuration option OPTIMIZE_EVALUATABLE_SUBQUERIES is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that within the code context provided, there is a check for the session database settings optimizeEvaluatableSubqueries. This configuration directly affects the evaluation of subqueries, which can have a significant impact on performance at the system level. By enabling or disabling this configuration, it can lead to notable performance variations in query execution time and memory consumption."
