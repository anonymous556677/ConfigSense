    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option ESTIMATED_FUNCTION_TABLE_ROWS is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the configuration directly affects the system performance at the system level. In the provided code context, the configuration 'estimatedFunctionTableRows' is used to determine the expected number of rows, which in turn impacts the cost calculation. The value of 'estimatedFunctionTableRows' directly influences the execution time of the getCost method, making it a performance-sensitive configuration."
