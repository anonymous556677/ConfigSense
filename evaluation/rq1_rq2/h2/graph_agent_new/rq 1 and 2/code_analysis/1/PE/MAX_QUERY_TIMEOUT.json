    "Reason": "The configuration option MAX_QUERY_TIMEOUT is not performance-sensitive. The code snippet provided does not contain any performance-related operations that are time-expensive or memory-expensive. The configuration setting only checks and sets the query timeout value based on the maximum allowed value from the database settings. This operation does not directly and substantially affect system performance at the system level, and it does not lead to notable performance variations."
