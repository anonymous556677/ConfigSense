    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The DEFAULT_TABLE_ENGINE configuration option is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the tableEngine parameter within the code context directly influences the engine used for creating tables, which can have a significant impact on system performance at the system level. The configuration-related code snippet shows that the tableEngine parameter is used to determine the engine for creating tables, and this operation can be time-expensive and memory-expensive, leading to notable performance variations in the system. Therefore, the DEFAULT_TABLE_ENGINE configuration is considered performance-sensitive."
