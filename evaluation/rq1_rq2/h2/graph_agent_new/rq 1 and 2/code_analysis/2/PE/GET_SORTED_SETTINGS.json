    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option GET_SORTED_SETTINGS is performance-sensitive. The configuration involves performance-related operations that are time-expensive and memory-expensive within its related code. The method 'settings' iterates over database settings, retrieves values, and adds them to the session rows. This process involves multiple database operations and data manipulations, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
