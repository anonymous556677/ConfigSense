    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option OPTIMIZE_INSERT_FROM_SELECT is performance-sensitive. The code context shows that the behavior of the configuration setting 'optimizeInsertFromSelect' directly impacts the query execution flow and result handling. The setting influences the optimization of insert operations from select queries, which can lead to significant performance variations at the system level. The code snippet checks for this configuration setting and executes different query processing logic based on its value, indicating that it has a substantial impact on performance. Therefore, the configuration is classified as performance-sensitive."
