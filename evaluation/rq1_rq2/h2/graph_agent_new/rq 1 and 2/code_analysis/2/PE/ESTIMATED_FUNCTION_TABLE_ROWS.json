    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option ESTIMATED_FUNCTION_TABLE_ROWS is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the configuration directly affects the system performance at the system level. The code snippet provided shows that the configuration is used to calculate the expected number of rows in a table, which is then multiplied by 10. This operation is time-expensive and can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, making it performance-sensitive."
