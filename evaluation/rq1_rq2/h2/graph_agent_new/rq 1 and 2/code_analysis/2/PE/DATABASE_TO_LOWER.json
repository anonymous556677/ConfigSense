{
    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option DATABASE_TO_LOWER is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the configuration involves performance-related operations within its related code. Specifically, the code snippet in the getValue method checks if the databaseToLower setting is enabled and converts strings to lower case using StringUtils.toLowerEnglish method. This operation can be time-expensive and memory-expensive, leading to notable performance variations at the system level. Therefore, the configuration is considered performance-sensitive."
