    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'LOB_TIMEOUT' is classified as performance-sensitive. The code context provided shows that the 'LOB_TIMEOUT' configuration is used to calculate the 'keepYoungerThan' value based on the 'lobTimeout' setting from the database. This calculation involves time-expensive operations (multiplication and subtraction) that directly impact the execution time of the 'removeTemporaryLobs' method. Additionally, the 'LOB_TIMEOUT' configuration influences the behavior of the method onTimeout, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Therefore, the 'LOB_TIMEOUT' configuration is considered performance-sensitive."
