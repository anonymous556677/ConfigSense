    "Reason": "The MAX_QUERY_TIMEOUT configuration option is not performance-sensitive. The code snippet provided does not contain any performance-related operations that are time-expensive or memory-expensive. The configuration setting only checks if the queryTimeout value exceeds the max value from database settings and sets it accordingly, without any significant impact on system performance."
