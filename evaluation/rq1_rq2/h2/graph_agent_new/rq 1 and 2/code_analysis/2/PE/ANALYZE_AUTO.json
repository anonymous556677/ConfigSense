    "Reason": "The configuration option ANALYZE_AUTO is not performance-sensitive based on the provided code context. The code snippet provided mainly focuses on setting up the MVTable object by checking for large objects in columns, initializing variables, creating indexes, and setting up trace locks. The code does not contain any performance-intensive operations or configurations that directly and substantially affect system performance at the system level. The isLargeObject method, although related to the configuration, is a simple check for lob types and does not directly impact system performance significantly."
