{
    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'OPTIMIZE_OR' is performance-sensitive. This classification is based on the fact that the 'optimize' method contains performance-related operations that contribute significantly to execution time and memory consumption. The method involves sorting expressions by cost, optimizing combinations, and handling conditions based on 'AND' and 'OR' types, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Additionally, the method includes comparisons, additions, and optimizations that are time-expensive and memory-expensive, making the configuration performance-sensitive."
