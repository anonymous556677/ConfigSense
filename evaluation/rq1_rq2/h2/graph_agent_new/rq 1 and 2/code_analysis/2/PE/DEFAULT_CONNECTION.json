    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The DEFAULT_CONNECTION configuration is performance-sensitive. The code context provided shows that the configuration directly affects system performance by creating a JDBC connection and invoking methods that can have a notable impact on execution time and memory consumption. The configuration involves performance-related operations such as creating connections, setting autoCommit properties, and invoking methods that can lead to significant performance variations at the system level."
