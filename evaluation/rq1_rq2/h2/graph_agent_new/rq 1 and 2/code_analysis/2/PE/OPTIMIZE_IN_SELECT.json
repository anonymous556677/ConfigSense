    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option OPTIMIZE_IN_SELECT is classified as performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the code context provided contains performance-related operations that directly impact system performance. The configuration setting 'optimizeInSelect' is checked within the code, and based on its value, different paths are taken which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The code snippet involves comparisons and optimizations based on this configuration setting, which can be time-expensive and memory-expensive, thus making the configuration performance-sensitive."
