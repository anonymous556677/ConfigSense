    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option OPTIMIZE_DISTINCT is performance-sensitive. The code context provided shows that the configuration involves optimizing expressions and preserving aliases in a query. This optimization process directly impacts the execution time and memory consumption of the system. The code snippet includes operations that are time-expensive and memory-expensive, such as optimizing expressions and setting indexes based on selectivity. These operations can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, making the configuration performance-sensitive."
