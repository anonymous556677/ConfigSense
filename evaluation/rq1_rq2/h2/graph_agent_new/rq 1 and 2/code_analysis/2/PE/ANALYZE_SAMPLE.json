    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option ANALYZE_SAMPLE is performance-sensitive. The code snippet provided shows that the configuration involves analyzing tables, which can be time-expensive and memory-expensive operations. The configuration directly affects system performance by analyzing tables with a sample size that can impact execution time and memory consumption. Therefore, it leads to notable performance variations at the system level."
