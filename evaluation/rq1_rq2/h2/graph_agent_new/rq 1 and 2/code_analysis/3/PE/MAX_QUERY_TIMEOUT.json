    "Reason": "The configuration option MAX_QUERY_TIMEOUT is not performance-sensitive. The code snippet provided does not contain any performance-related operations that are time-expensive or memory-expensive. The configuration setting only checks if the queryTimeout value exceeds the max value from database settings and sets it to the max value if necessary. This operation does not directly and substantially affect system performance at the system level, leading to notable performance variations."
