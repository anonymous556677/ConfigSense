    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option DATABASE_TO_LOWER is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the configuration involves performance-related operations within its related code. Specifically, the use of StringUtils.toLowerEnglish() method in the code snippet contributes to time-expensive operations, as it converts strings to lower case. This can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, especially when applied to database identifiers and user names. Additionally, the configuration directly affects system performance by potentially increasing memory consumption due to the additional string manipulation operations."
