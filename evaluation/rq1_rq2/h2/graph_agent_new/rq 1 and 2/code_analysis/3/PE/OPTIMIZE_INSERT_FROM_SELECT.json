{
    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option OPTIMIZE_INSERT_FROM_SELECT is performance-sensitive. The code context shows that if the database setting optimizeInsertFromSelect is true, it triggers specific code paths that involve time-expensive and memory-expensive operations such as querying, sorting, and result manipulation. These operations can have a notable impact on system performance at the system level, leading to significant performance variations. Therefore, based on the code analysis, this configuration is classified as performance-sensitive."
