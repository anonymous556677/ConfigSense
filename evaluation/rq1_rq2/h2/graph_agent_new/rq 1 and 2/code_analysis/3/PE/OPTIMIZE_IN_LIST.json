    "Reason": "The configuration option OPTIMIZE_IN_LIST is performance-sensitive. This is because the code context provided shows that the configuration setting is directly used to optimize the performance of IN(...) and IN(SELECT ...) comparisons. The code snippets related to this configuration involve operations that contribute positively to execution time and memory consumption, such as checking for specific conditions and adding index conditions based on the configuration setting. These operations can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, making the configuration performance-sensitive."
