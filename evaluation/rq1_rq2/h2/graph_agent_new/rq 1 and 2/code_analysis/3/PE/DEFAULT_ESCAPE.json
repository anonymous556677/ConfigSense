    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The configuration option DEFAULT_ESCAPE is not performance-sensitive. The code context provided does not show any performance-related operations that are time-expensive or memory-expensive. The method getSearchStringEscape simply returns a value from the session's database settings, which does not have a significant impact on system performance. Therefore, based on the code context, DEFAULT_ESCAPE is not classified as performance-sensitive."
