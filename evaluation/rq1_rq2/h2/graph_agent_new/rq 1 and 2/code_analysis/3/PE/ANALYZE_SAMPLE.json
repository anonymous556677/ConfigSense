    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option ANALYZE_SAMPLE is performance-sensitive. The analyzeTable method, which is related to this configuration, involves time-expensive operations such as scanning through rows, calculating selectivity, and updating meta information. These operations directly impact system performance by consuming significant execution time and memory resources. Therefore, any changes to the ANALYZE_SAMPLE setting can lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
