    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'LOB_TIMEOUT' is considered performance-sensitive. The code context provided includes operations that involve time-expensive calculations based on the 'lobTimeout' setting from the database. The 'lobTimeout' setting is used to determine the time threshold for removing temporary lobs, which directly impacts the performance of the system by affecting the execution time of the 'removeTemporaryLobs' method. The calculation of 'keepYoungerThan' based on 'lobTimeout' and the conditional checks for timeout conditions contribute to notable performance variations at the system level. Therefore, the configuration is performance-sensitive."
