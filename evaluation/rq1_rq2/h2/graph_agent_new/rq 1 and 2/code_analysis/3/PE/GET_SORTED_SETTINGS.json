    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option GET_SORTED_SETTINGS is performance-sensitive. The configuration involves performance-related operations within its related code, such as iterating over database settings and adding them to the session rows. These operations can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, especially when dealing with a large number of settings. Therefore, the configuration is considered performance-sensitive."
