    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option ESTIMATED_FUNCTION_TABLE_ROWS is performance-sensitive. This is because the value of 'estimatedFunctionTableRows' directly affects the expected number of rows in the query result, which in turn impacts the cost calculation in the getCost method. The configuration-related code snippet retrieves the value of 'estimatedFunctionTableRows' from the database settings and uses it to calculate the expected number of rows, which is then multiplied by 10. Any variation in the 'estimatedFunctionTableRows' value will lead to notable performance variations at the system level, making this configuration performance-sensitive."
