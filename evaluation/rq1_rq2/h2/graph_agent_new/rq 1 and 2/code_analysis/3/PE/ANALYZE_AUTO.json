    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option ANALYZE_AUTO is performance-sensitive. The code snippet provided contains a method isLargeObject which checks if a given value type is a large object (BLOB or CLOB). This method is used in the context of the ANALYZE operation for determining how often it is automatically run for a table based on the number of changes made. Since the presence of large objects can significantly impact the performance of the ANALYZE operation, this configuration is considered performance-sensitive."
