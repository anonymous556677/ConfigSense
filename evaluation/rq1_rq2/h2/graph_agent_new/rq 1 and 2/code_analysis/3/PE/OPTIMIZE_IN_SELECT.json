    "Reason": "The configuration option OPTIMIZE_IN_SELECT is performance-sensitive. The configuration directly affects system performance by optimizing the IN(SELECT ...) comparisons in a database setting. The code context provided shows that the configuration involves performance-related operations such as querying, checking for distinct values, and optimizing the select query based on certain conditions. These operations can have a notable impact on system performance at the system level, making the configuration performance-sensitive."
