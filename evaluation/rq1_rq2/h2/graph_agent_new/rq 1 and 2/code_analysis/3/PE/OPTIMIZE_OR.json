    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'OPTIMIZE_OR' is performance-sensitive. The code context provided contains performance-related operations that are time-expensive and memory-expensive. The 'optimize' method involves optimizing sub-expressions and combinations, which can have a notable impact on system performance at the system level. The method includes sorting expressions by cost, adding additional conditions, and optimizing conditions based on 'AND' and 'OR' types. These operations can lead to significant performance variations, making the configuration performance-sensitive."
