    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The configuration QUERY_CACHE_SIZE determines the size of the query cache in number of cached statements. Each session has its own cache with the given size. The cache is used to store the last returned result per query if the SQL statement and all parameters match. Various statement types such as SELECT, CALL, DELETE, INSERT, MERGE, UPDATE, and transactional statements are cached.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The configuration is triggered whenever a query is executed in the system. The frequency of triggering depends on the number of queries being executed and the size of the query cache specified by the configuration.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the QUERY_CACHE_SIZE configuration option on the system is that it affects the memory usage and performance of the system. A larger cache size can improve query performance by reducing the need to re-execute the same query, but it also consumes more memory. On the other hand, a smaller cache size may lead to more frequent query executions but lower memory usage."
