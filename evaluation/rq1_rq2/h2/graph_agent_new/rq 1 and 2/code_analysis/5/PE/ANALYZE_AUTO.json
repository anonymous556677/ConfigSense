    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option ANALYZE_AUTO is performance-sensitive. The code snippet provided contains a method isLargeObject which checks if a given value type is a large object (BLOB or CLOB). This method is used to determine if a column in the table contains large objects, which can have a significant impact on the performance of the ANALYZE operation for that table. Analyzing tables with large objects can be time-expensive and memory-expensive, leading to notable performance variations at the system level."
