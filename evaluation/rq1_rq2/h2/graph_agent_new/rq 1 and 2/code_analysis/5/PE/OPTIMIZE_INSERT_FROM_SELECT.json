    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option OPTIMIZE_INSERT_FROM_SELECT is performance-sensitive. The code context shows that the configuration setting 'optimizeInsertFromSelect' directly influences the execution path of the query processing logic. When this configuration is enabled, it triggers specific code paths that optimize the insert operation from a select query, potentially avoiding unnecessary processing steps. This optimization can lead to notable performance variations at the system level by reducing the execution time and memory consumption for certain query scenarios. Therefore, the configuration is considered performance-sensitive as it directly and substantially affects system performance by optimizing insert operations."
