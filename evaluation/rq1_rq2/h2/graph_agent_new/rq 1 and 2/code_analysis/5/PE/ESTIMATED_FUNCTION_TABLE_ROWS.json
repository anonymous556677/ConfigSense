    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'ESTIMATED_FUNCTION_TABLE_ROWS' is not performance-sensitive based on the provided code context. The code snippet does not contain any performance-related operations that are time-expensive or memory-expensive. The configuration is simply used to assign a value to 'expectedRows', which is then multiplied by 10 to calculate the cost. This configuration does not directly and substantially affect system performance at the system level, and it does not lead to notable performance variations. Therefore, it is classified as not performance-sensitive."
