    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option OPTIMIZE_DISTINCT is performance-sensitive. The code context provided contains multiple performance-related operations that directly impact system performance. The code snippet includes operations like optimizing expressions, cleaning up orders, optimizing conditions, and setting indexes based on certain conditions. These operations are time-expensive and memory-expensive, leading to notable performance variations at the system level. Additionally, the configuration involves optimizing expressions under specific conditions, which can significantly affect the query execution time and memory consumption."
