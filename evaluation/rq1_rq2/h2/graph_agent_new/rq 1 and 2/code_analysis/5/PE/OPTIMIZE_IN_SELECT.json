    "Reason": "The configuration option OPTIMIZE_IN_SELECT is not performance-sensitive. The code context provided does not contain any performance-related operations that are time-expensive or memory-expensive. The configuration setting 'optimizeInSelect' is checked within the code, but it does not directly and substantially affect system performance at the system level. The code mainly deals with querying and processing data, but the configuration itself does not lead to notable performance variations."
