    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'LOB_TIMEOUT' is performance-sensitive. The code snippet provided contains operations that are time-expensive, such as calculating 'keepYoungerThan' based on 'database.getSettings().lobTimeout'. This calculation can have a notable impact on system performance, especially if 'lobTimeout' is set to a large value. Additionally, the 'remove' method is used to manage resources efficiently, which can also impact system performance. Therefore, the configuration is considered performance-sensitive as it directly affects system performance at the system level."
