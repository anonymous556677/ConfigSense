    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The configuration option MAX_QUERY_TIMEOUT is not performance-sensitive. The code context provided shows that the configuration is simply setting a query timeout value based on a maximum value from database settings. There are no performance-related operations that are time-expensive or memory-expensive within the code snippet. The configuration does not directly and substantially affect system performance at the system level, and it does not lead to notable performance variations. Therefore, it is classified as not performance-sensitive."
