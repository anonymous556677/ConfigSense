    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option GET_SORTED_SETTINGS is performance-sensitive. The configuration involves performance-related operations that contribute to execution time and memory consumption. The method 'settings' retrieves settings from the database and adds them to the session rows. These settings can impact system performance at the system level, especially when iterating over the settings and adding them to the rows. Additionally, the method 'listSettings' lists all settings, which can potentially impact performance when retrieving and displaying a large number of settings."
