{
    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option ANALYZE_SAMPLE is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the code context provided includes operations that are time-expensive and memory-expensive. Specifically, the method analyzeTables() involves operations that can have a notable performance impact at the system level, such as analyzing tables and committing transactions. These operations can significantly affect system performance, making the configuration performance-sensitive."
