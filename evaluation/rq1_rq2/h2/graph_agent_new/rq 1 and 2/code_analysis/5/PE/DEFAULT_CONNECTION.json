    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The DEFAULT_CONNECTION configuration is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the configuration involves performance-related operations within its related code. The execute method contains operations that are time-expensive, such as creating connections, setting auto-commit, and invoking methods with parameters. These operations directly impact system performance at the system level, leading to notable performance variations. Therefore, the DEFAULT_CONNECTION configuration is considered performance-sensitive."
