    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The configuration MAX_QUERY_TIMEOUT is used to set the maximum timeout for a query in milliseconds. The code snippet provided checks if the specified query timeout exceeds the maximum configured value, and if so, sets it to the maximum value. It also resets the cancel time if needed.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The configuration is triggered whenever the setQueryTimeout method is called to set the query timeout value. The frequency of triggering depends on how often this method is called in the system.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the MAX_QUERY_TIMEOUT configuration option is to limit the maximum timeout for a query. Setting a lower value may result in queries being canceled prematurely, while setting a higher value may lead to longer query execution times. It is important to balance the timeout value to ensure optimal system performance."
