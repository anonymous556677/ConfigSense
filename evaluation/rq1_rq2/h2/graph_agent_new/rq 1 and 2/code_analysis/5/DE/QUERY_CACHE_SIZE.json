    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The configuration QUERY_CACHE_SIZE is used to determine the size of the query cache in number of cached statements. Each session has its own cache with the specified size. The cache is utilized when the SQL statement and all parameters match, and only the last returned result per query is cached. Various statement types such as SELECT, CALL, DELETE, INSERT, MERGE, UPDATE, and transactional statements like COMMIT are cached.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The triggering frequency of the QUERY_CACHE_SIZE configuration depends on the usage of cached statements in the system. The configuration is triggered whenever a query is executed and matches the criteria for caching as described above. The frequency can vary based on the number of queries being executed and the size of the cache.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the QUERY_CACHE_SIZE configuration option on the system is significant. A larger cache size can improve performance by reducing the need to re-execute queries that have already been cached. However, a very large cache size can consume more memory and potentially impact the overall system performance. It is important to find a balance between cache size and system resources to optimize performance."
