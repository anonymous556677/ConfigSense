    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The MAX_QUERY_TIMEOUT configuration is used to set the maximum timeout for a query in milliseconds. The code snippet provided shows that the setQueryTimeout method checks if the queryTimeout value is within the maximum allowed value specified in the database settings. If the queryTimeout exceeds the maximum value or is set to 0, it is adjusted to the maximum value. The method also resets the cancelAtNs variable to 0.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The triggering frequency of the MAX_QUERY_TIMEOUT configuration depends on how often the setQueryTimeout method is called in the system. If this method is called frequently to set query timeouts, then the configuration will be triggered frequently as well.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the MAX_QUERY_TIMEOUT configuration option is that it limits the maximum timeout for queries in the system. Setting a lower value for this configuration can potentially improve system performance by preventing long-running queries from consuming excessive resources. However, setting it too low may lead to queries being prematurely terminated."
