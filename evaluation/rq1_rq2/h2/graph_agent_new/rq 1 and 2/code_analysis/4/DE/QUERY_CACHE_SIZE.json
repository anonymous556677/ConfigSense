    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The configuration QUERY_CACHE_SIZE determines the size of the query cache in number of cached statements for each session. The cache is used to store the last returned result per query if the SQL statement and all parameters match. Various types of statements are cached including SELECT, CALL, DELETE, INSERT, MERGE, UPDATE, and transactional statements like COMMIT.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The configuration QUERY_CACHE_SIZE is triggered whenever a session is created in the system. Each session will have its own query cache with the specified size.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the QUERY_CACHE_SIZE configuration option is that it affects the memory usage of the system. A larger cache size will consume more memory but can improve performance by reducing the need to re-execute the same queries. On the other hand, a smaller cache size may save memory but could result in more frequent query executions."
