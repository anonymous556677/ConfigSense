    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option ANALYZE_AUTO is performance-sensitive. This is because the nextAnalyze value is directly related to the system performance, as it determines when the ANALYZE operation is automatically run for a table based on the number of changes made to that table. The code snippet 'nextAnalyze = database.getSettings().analyzeAuto' shows that this configuration involves a performance-related operation that can have a notable performance impact at the system level."
