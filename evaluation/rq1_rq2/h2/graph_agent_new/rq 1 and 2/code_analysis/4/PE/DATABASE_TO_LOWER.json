    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option DATABASE_TO_LOWER is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the configuration involves performance-related operations within its related code. Specifically, the code snippet shows that the configuration setting databaseToLower is checked multiple times in the code, and if it is true, the StringUtils.toLowerEnglish method is called to convert strings to lower case. This operation can be time-expensive and memory-expensive, especially when dealing with large amounts of data. As a result, this configuration directly and substantially affects system performance at the system level, leading to notable performance variations."
