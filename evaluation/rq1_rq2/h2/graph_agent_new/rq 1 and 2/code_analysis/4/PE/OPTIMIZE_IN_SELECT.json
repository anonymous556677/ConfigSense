    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The OPTIMIZE_IN_SELECT configuration option is not performance-sensitive based on the provided code context. The configuration setting 'optimizeInSelect' is checked within the code, but it does not involve any time-expensive or memory-expensive operations that would lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The code mainly deals with querying and processing results, and the configuration check is just one of the conditions for returning a specific value. Therefore, the configuration does not directly and substantially affect system performance."
