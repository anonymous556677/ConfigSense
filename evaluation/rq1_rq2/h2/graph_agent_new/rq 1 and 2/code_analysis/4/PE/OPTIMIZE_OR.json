    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'OPTIMIZE_OR' is performance-sensitive. The code context provided contains multiple performance-related operations such as optimizing individual sub-expressions, sorting expressions by cost, and optimizing combinations. These operations contribute to notable performance variations at the system level. The code involves time-expensive and memory-expensive operations that directly and substantially affect system performance, making the configuration performance-sensitive."
