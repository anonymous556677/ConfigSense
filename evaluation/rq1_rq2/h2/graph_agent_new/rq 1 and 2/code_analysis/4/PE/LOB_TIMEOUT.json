    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'LOB_TIMEOUT' is performance-sensitive. The code snippet provided shows that the 'lobTimeout' setting is used to calculate a time threshold for removing temporary result lobs. This calculation involves a time-expensive operation (multiplication by 1_000_000L) and can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Additionally, the 'remove' method within the code snippet is related to managing resources, which can have memory-expensive operations. Therefore, the 'LOB_TIMEOUT' configuration directly and substantially affects system performance and is considered performance-sensitive."
