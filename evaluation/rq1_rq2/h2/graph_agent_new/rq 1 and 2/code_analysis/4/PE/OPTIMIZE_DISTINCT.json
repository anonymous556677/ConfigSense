    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option OPTIMIZE_DISTINCT is performance-sensitive. The configuration involves performance-related operations such as optimizing expressions and preserving aliases in the code context. The optimization process is triggered based on specific conditions like single column query, no conditions, one table involved, ascending index, and selectivity below 20. These operations directly impact system performance by potentially improving query execution time and memory consumption, leading to notable performance variations at the system level."
