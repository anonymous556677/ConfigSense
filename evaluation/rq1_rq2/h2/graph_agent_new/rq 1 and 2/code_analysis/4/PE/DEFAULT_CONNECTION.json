    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option DEFAULT_CONNECTION is performance-sensitive. This is because the code context provided contains performance-related operations that are time-expensive and memory-expensive. The method execute() involves creating a JDBC connection, setting parameters, invoking a method, and handling exceptions, all of which can have a notable impact on system performance. Additionally, the configuration directly affects system performance at the system level by manipulating session settings and database connections."
