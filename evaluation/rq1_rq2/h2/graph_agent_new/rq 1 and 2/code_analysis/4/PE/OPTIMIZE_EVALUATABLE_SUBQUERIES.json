    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option OPTIMIZE_EVALUATABLE_SUBQUERIES is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the code snippet related to this configuration involves a check for the session database settings optimizeEvaluatableSubqueries. This check directly impacts the execution time of the program as it determines whether certain subqueries will be optimized or not. If this configuration is set to false, it can lead to notable performance variations at the system level due to the potentially inefficient handling of subqueries."
