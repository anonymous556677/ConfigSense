    "Reason": "The configuration option OPTIMIZE_INSERT_FROM_SELECT is performance-sensitive. The code snippet related to this configuration involves performance-related operations that directly impact system performance. The configuration setting 'optimizeInsertFromSelect' affects the behavior of inserting data from a select query directly, bypassing temporary disk storage. This optimization setting influences the query execution process, including the creation and handling of LocalResult objects, which are memory-expensive operations. The presence of this configuration setting leads to notable performance variations at the system level, making it performance-sensitive."
