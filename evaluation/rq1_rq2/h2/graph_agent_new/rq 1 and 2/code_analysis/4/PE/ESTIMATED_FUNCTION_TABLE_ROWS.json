    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option ESTIMATED_FUNCTION_TABLE_ROWS is classified as performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the configuration directly affects the system performance at the system level. In the code context provided, the configuration 'estimatedFunctionTableRows' is used to calculate the expected number of rows, which in turn impacts the cost calculation. The use of this configuration in the code snippet contributes to the execution time of the method 'getCost', making it time-expensive. Therefore, any changes in the 'estimatedFunctionTableRows' configuration can lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
