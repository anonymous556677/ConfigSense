    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The configuration code retrieves the value of the ANALYZE_SAMPLE setting from the database settings and assigns it to the sampleRows variable in the Analyze constructor. This value is then used to determine the sample size when analyzing tables.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The configuration is triggered when the analyzeTables method is called, which happens when there are tables to be analyzed and the current thread holds the lock. The configuration is triggered based on the tables that need to be analyzed and the sample size calculation.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the ANALYZE_SAMPLE configuration option is on the sample size used when analyzing tables. A larger sample size may provide more accurate analysis results but could also increase the processing time and resource usage. Conversely, a smaller sample size may be faster but could result in less accurate analysis results."
