    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The 'ESTIMATED_FUNCTION_TABLE_ROWS' configuration is not performance-sensitive based on the provided code context and developer information. The configuration is used to determine the estimated number of rows in a function table, which is a static value retrieved from the database settings when the table cannot provide an approximation. This configuration does not involve any time-expensive or memory-expensive operations within its related code. It does not directly and substantially affect system performance at the system level, and it does not lead to notable performance variations. Therefore, it is classified as not performance-sensitive."
