    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option OPTIMIZE_EVALUATABLE_SUBQUERIES is performance-sensitive. This is because the setting directly influences the optimization of subqueries that are not dependent on the outer query, which can have a notable impact on query performance at the system level. The code context shows that if the setting is false, it will return false, indicating that the optimization will not occur, potentially leading to slower query execution. Therefore, the configuration is considered performance-sensitive as it directly affects the system's performance based on the code logic."
