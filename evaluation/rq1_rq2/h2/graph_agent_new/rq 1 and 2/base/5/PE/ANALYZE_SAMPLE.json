    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option ANALYZE_SAMPLE is considered performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the configuration directly affects the sample size used when analyzing tables, which can have a notable impact on system performance. The code snippet shows that the sample size is calculated based on this configuration, and the analysis of tables is performed accordingly. The size of the sample can significantly impact the execution time and resource usage, making it a performance-sensitive configuration."
