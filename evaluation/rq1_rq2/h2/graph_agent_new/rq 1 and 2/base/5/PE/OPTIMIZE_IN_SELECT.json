    "Reason": "The OPTIMIZE_IN_SELECT configuration is considered performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly impacts the performance of certain comparison operations in the code. When the configuration is enabled, it takes a faster path for certain comparisons, leading to notable performance improvements at the system level. The code snippet provided shows that the configuration setting is checked to determine the execution path, and the optimization process involves handling boolean values efficiently. This optimization process can have a significant impact on the system's performance, making the configuration performance-sensitive."
