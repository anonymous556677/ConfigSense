    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option OPTIMIZE_IN_LIST is performance-sensitive. The code context shows that this configuration directly impacts the performance of index conditions creation based on the optimizeInList setting. The configuration involves performance-related operations such as optimizing comparisons for SELECT, DELETE, and UPDATE operations, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The developer's understanding also confirms that the configuration significantly affects the performance of operations involving IN(...) and IN(SELECT ...) comparisons, emphasizing its performance sensitivity."
