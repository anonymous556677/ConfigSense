    "Reason": "The configuration MAX_QUERY_TIMEOUT is not performance-sensitive based on the provided code context and developer information. The code snippet provided only sets the queryTimeout to the maximum value specified in the database settings if it is less than the specified value or if it is 0. This operation does not contribute significantly to execution time or memory consumption. Additionally, the configuration is related to setting a maximum timeout for a query, which is a necessary feature for preventing queries from running indefinitely and does not directly impact system performance at a notable level."
