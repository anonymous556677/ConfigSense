    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option RECOMPILE_ALWAYS is performance-sensitive. The needRecompile() method directly impacts system performance by potentially triggering re-compilation of prepared statements every time it is called. This can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, as it involves time-expensive operations such as checking the database status and comparing modificationMetaId values. Additionally, setting RECOMPILE_ALWAYS to true can have a significant impact on CPU and memory usage, further emphasizing its performance sensitivity."
