    "Reason": "The configuration option DATABASE_TO_LOWER is not performance-sensitive based on the provided code context and developer's information. The configuration involves converting identifiers to lower case, which is a relatively simple operation and does not have a significant impact on system performance. The code snippets related to this configuration do not contain any time-expensive or memory-expensive operations that would lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
