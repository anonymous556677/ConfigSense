    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The LOB_TIMEOUT configuration is considered performance-sensitive because it directly affects the performance and resource usage of the system at the system level. The code snippet related to the configuration involves time-expensive operations, such as calculating the time threshold for removing temporary LOBs based on the lobTimeout setting. This calculation can lead to notable performance variations, especially when the frequency of invoking the removeTemporaryLobs method is high. Therefore, the configuration is performance-sensitive due to its impact on system performance and resource management."
