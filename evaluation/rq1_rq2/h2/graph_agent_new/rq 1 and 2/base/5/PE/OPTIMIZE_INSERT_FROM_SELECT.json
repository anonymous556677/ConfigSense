    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration OPTIMIZE_INSERT_FROM_SELECT is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts system performance at the system level. The code context shows that when the database setting 'optimizeInsertFromSelect' is enabled, the insert operation is optimized by directly inserting into a table from a query without using temporary disk storage. This optimization can lead to notable performance improvements by reducing disk I/O operations and improving efficiency, making it a performance-sensitive configuration."
