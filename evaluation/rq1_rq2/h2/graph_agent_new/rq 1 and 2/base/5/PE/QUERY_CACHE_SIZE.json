    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The QUERY_CACHE_SIZE configuration is classified as performance-sensitive. This is because the size of the query cache directly impacts the memory usage of the system. A larger cache size can lead to increased memory consumption, while a smaller cache size may result in more frequent re-execution of queries, affecting overall system performance. Additionally, the code snippet provided shows that the queryCacheSize configuration is set at the session level, indicating that it has a direct impact on performance-related operations within the code."
