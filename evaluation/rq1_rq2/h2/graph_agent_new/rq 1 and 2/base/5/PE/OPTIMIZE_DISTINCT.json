    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option OPTIMIZE_DISTINCT is classified as performance-sensitive. This classification is based on the fact that the configuration directly impacts the performance of distinct queries by applying optimization conditions specified in the code context. The code snippet related to the configuration involves operations that are time-expensive and memory-expensive, such as optimizing expressions and preserving aliases. These operations contribute significantly to the execution time and memory consumption at the system level, leading to notable performance variations. Therefore, the OPTIMIZE_DISTINCT configuration is considered performance-sensitive."
