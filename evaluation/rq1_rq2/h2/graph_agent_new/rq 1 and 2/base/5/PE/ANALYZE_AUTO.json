    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The 'ANALYZE_AUTO' configuration is not performance-sensitive based on the provided code context and developer information. The configuration primarily involves setting the frequency for automatically running the ANALYZE operation on a table after a certain number of row changes. This operation is aimed at optimizing table statistics to improve query performance and system efficiency. While running ANALYZE too frequently can impact system performance due to resource-intensive nature, the configuration itself does not directly involve any time-expensive or memory-expensive operations that would lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
