    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option QUERY_CACHE_SIZE is considered performance-sensitive. This is because the size of the query cache directly impacts the memory usage and performance of the system at the system level. A larger cache size can improve query performance by reducing the need to re-execute queries, but it also increases memory usage. On the other hand, a smaller cache size may lead to more frequent query executions but lower memory consumption. Additionally, the code context provided shows that the queryCacheSize is set based on the database settings, indicating that it plays a crucial role in the system's performance."
