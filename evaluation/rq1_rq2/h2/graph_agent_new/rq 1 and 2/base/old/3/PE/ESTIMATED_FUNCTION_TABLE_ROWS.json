    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration 'ESTIMATED_FUNCTION_TABLE_ROWS' is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the query execution plan in the system. The value of this configuration affects the estimated number of rows in a function table, which in turn influences the optimizer's decision on how to execute the query. A higher value can lead to more resource-intensive query plans, while a lower value may result in less optimized plans. Therefore, this configuration has a direct and substantial effect on system performance at the system level."
