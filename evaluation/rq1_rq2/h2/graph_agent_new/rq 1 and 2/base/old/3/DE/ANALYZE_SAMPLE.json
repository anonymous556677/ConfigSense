    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The configuration code is used to set the sample size when analyzing a table in the database. It retrieves the value of the 'ANALYZE_SAMPLE' configuration from the database settings and uses it to determine the row count for analysis.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The configuration is triggered when the 'analyzeTables' method is called and certain conditions are met, such as the presence of tables to analyze and holding the lock. The frequency of triggering depends on the occurrence of these conditions.",

A larger sample size may provide more representative results but can also increase the processing time and resource usage. Conversely, a smaller sample size may lead to quicker analysis but with potentially less accurate insights."
