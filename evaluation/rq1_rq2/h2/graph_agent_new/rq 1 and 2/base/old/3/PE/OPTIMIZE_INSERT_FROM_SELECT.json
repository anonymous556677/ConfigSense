    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option OPTIMIZE_INSERT_FROM_SELECT is performance-sensitive. This is because the setting directly impacts the execution of insert operations from select queries by bypassing temporary disk storage. The code context shows that when the configuration is enabled, specific conditions are checked before executing the insert operation directly, which can have a substantial impact on system performance at the database query processing level. By avoiding temporary disk storage, the configuration can potentially improve performance but may also increase memory usage. Therefore, the configuration directly influences system performance and is not trivial."
