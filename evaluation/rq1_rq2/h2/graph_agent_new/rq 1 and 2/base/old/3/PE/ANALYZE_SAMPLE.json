    "Reason": "The 'ANALYZE_SAMPLE' configuration is considered performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the efficiency and resource usage of table analysis at the system level. The code snippet provided shows that the configuration value is used to determine the row count for analysis, which can significantly affect the processing time and accuracy of the analysis results. Modifying this configuration can have a substantial impact on the overall performance of the system during table analysis."
