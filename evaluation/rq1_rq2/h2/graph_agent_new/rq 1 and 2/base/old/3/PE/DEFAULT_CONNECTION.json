    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The DEFAULT_CONNECTION configuration is classified as performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly affects system performance at the system level by determining whether Java functions can use a default connection to get a database connection. The code context shows that when the configuration is set to true, a default connection is created and set as the default connection, which can impact the behavior and performance of Java functions that rely on this default connection. Therefore, the configuration has a substantial impact on system performance, making it performance-sensitive."
