    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The configuration RECOMPILE_ALWAYS is a boolean setting that determines whether prepared statements should always be recompiled. In the needRecompile() method, the configuration is checked along with other conditions to decide if a statement needs to be re-compiled.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The configuration is triggered whenever a prepared statement is being executed and the needRecompile() method is called to check if recompilation is required. The frequency of triggering depends on how often prepared statements are executed in the system.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "Enabling RECOMPILE_ALWAYS can have a performance impact on the system as it will cause prepared statements to be recompiled every time they are executed. This can lead to increased CPU usage and potentially slower execution times, but it ensures that the statements are always up to date with the latest changes in the database."
