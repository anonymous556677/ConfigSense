    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The configuration option GET_SORTED_SETTINGS retrieves settings and system information from the database and adds them to a session. This process involves iterating over settings and adding them to the session, which is a standard operation and does not involve complex computations or external dependencies that would significantly impact performance at the system level. Therefore, the configuration is not considered performance-sensitive."
