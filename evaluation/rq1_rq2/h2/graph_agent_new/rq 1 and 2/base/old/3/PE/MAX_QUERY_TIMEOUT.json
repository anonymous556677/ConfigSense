    "Reason": "The MAX_QUERY_TIMEOUT configuration is not considered performance-sensitive based on the provided code context and developer information. The configuration sets the queryTimeout value to the maximum value specified in the database settings if it is less than the specified value or if it is 0. While this configuration can impact the behavior of query timeouts, it does not directly and substantially affect system performance at the system level. The code snippet provided focuses on setting a limit for query timeouts rather than directly impacting system performance."
