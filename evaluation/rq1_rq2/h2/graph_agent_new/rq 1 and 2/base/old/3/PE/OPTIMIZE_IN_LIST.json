    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option OPTIMIZE_IN_LIST is performance-sensitive. This is because it directly impacts the system performance by optimizing the comparison operations involving the use of IN(...) or IN(SELECT ...) comparisons. The code context shows that the configuration is checked before applying optimization logic, which can lead to faster query execution times and improved efficiency at the system level."
