    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option DATABASE_TO_LOWER is performance-sensitive. This is because the setting directly impacts the processing of identifiers in the system, affecting how they are compared and used in queries. The configuration is checked in multiple critical code sections where identifiers are being used, and if enabled, it triggers the conversion of identifiers to lower case using StringUtils.toLowerEnglish() method. This conversion process adds an extra computational overhead and can impact system performance, especially when dealing with a large number of identifiers. Therefore, the configuration's direct and substantial effect on system performance at the system level classifies it as performance-sensitive."
