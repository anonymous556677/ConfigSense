    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option ANALYZE_AUTO is considered performance-sensitive. This is because the frequency at which the ANALYZE command is automatically triggered directly impacts system performance. The code snippet shows that the nextAnalyze variable is set based on the database settings, which determines when the ANALYZE operation is run. Running ANALYZE too frequently can introduce overhead and impact system performance. Therefore, the configuration has a direct and substantial effect on system performance at the system level."
