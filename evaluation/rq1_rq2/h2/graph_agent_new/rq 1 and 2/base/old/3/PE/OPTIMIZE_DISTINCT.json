    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option OPTIMIZE_DISTINCT is performance-sensitive. The code context provided shows that the configuration directly impacts the optimization of distinct queries by applying specific conditions to improve query performance. The configuration checks for conditions like single column query without condition, one table involved, ascending index on the column, and selectivity below 20 to optimize the query. This optimization directly affects system performance at the query execution level by reducing processing time and resource usage for distinct queries that meet the optimization criteria."
