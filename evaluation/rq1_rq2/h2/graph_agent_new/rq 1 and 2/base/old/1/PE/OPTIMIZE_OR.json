    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option is performance-sensitive because it involves optimizing query conditions by converting OR conditions to IN clauses, which can have a significant impact on query performance. The code context shows that the optimization process involves multiple checks and comparisons that can be time-expensive and memory-expensive, leading to notable performance variations at the system level. Therefore, the configuration is considered performance-sensitive based on the code analysis and the potential impact on system performance."
