    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The setQueryTimeout method sets the query timeout value based on the maximum query timeout setting from the database settings. If the maximum query timeout is not 0 and is less than the provided query timeout or the query timeout is 0, then the query timeout is set to the maximum value.

This helps in preventing queries from running longer than the allowed maximum timeout, which can improve system performance and prevent potential issues related to long-running queries."
