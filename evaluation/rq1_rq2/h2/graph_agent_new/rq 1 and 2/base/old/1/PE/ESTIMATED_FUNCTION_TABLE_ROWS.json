    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'ESTIMATED_FUNCTION_TABLE_ROWS' does not directly involve any time-expensive or memory-expensive operations within the related code. The code snippet provided calculates the expected number of rows based on this configuration but does not show any significant performance impact that would lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Therefore, the configuration is not classified as performance-sensitive."
