    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the sample size used when analyzing tables, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The code snippet shows that the configuration retrieves the analyzeSample setting from the database settings and uses it to determine the sample size, which can be time-expensive and memory-expensive depending on the size of the sample. Additionally, the configuration is triggered when analyzing tables, which indicates that it is closely tied to performance-related operations within the code."
