    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts system performance by forcing the system to always recompile prepared statements. This can increase the system's workload and resource usage, leading to notable performance variations at the system level. The code snippet provided shows that the needRecompile() method is called whenever a statement is prepared, or when the modificationMetaId in the database changes, or when the recompileAlways setting in the database settings is true. These operations are time-expensive and can have a significant impact on system performance."
