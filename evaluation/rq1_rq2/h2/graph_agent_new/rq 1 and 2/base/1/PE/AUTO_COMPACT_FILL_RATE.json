    "Reason": "The 'AUTO_COMPACT_FILL_RATE' configuration does not appear to be performance-sensitive based on the provided code context and developer information. The configuration mainly focuses on optimizing storage space usage and triggering auto-compacting based on fill rates, which may have an impact on storage efficiency but does not directly involve time-expensive or memory-expensive operations that would lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The code snippet provided primarily deals with setting database settings and does not contain performance-sensitive operations."
