    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option DEFAULT_TABLE_ENGINE is performance-sensitive. The code context shows that the DEFAULT_TABLE_ENGINE configuration directly impacts the table engine used for creating new tables in the system. This can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, as different table engines have varying performance characteristics. Additionally, the createTable method checks and uses this configuration to determine the table engine to use if not specified in the CreateTableData object, indicating that it plays a crucial role in the performance of table creation operations."
