    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option OPTIMIZE_DISTINCT is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the system performance by optimizing the processing of simple DISTINCT queries. The code snippet related to this configuration involves checking specific conditions like single column query without condition, one table involved, ascending index on the column, and selectivity below 20. These conditions lead to notable performance improvements at the system level by utilizing indexes and optimizing query execution, making it a performance-sensitive configuration."
