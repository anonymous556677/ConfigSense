    "Reason": "The configuration option is not performance-sensitive because the code primarily deals with retrieving values based on session and database information. The operations within the code do not involve any time-extensive or memory-extensive tasks that would lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The impact of this configuration on system performance is minimal, and it is not directly and substantially affecting system performance."
