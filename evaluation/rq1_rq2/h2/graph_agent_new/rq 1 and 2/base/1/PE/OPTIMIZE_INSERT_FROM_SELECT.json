    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option OPTIMIZE_INSERT_FROM_SELECT is performance-sensitive. This is because it directly affects the behavior of the query execution process in the code by optimizing insert operations. The condition db.getSettings().optimizeInsertFromSelect is checked before executing certain parts of the query logic, indicating that it has a direct and substantial impact on system performance at the system level. By bypassing temporary disk storage, this configuration can lead to notable performance variations in terms of faster query execution and reduced resource usage, making it a performance-sensitive configuration."
