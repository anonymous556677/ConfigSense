    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'ANALYZE_AUTO' is performance-sensitive. The initialization of the 'nextAnalyze' variable based on this configuration directly impacts the frequency of the ANALYZE operation, which in turn affects the performance and optimization of the database at the system level. The code snippet shows that the configuration involves time-expensive operations related to analyzing tables, which can lead to notable performance variations. Additionally, the developer's explanation highlights that running ANALYZE too frequently can impact system performance due to the overhead involved, further emphasizing the performance sensitivity of this configuration."
