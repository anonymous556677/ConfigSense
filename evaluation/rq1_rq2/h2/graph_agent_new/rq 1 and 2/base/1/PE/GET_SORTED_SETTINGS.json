    "Reason": "The configuration code iterates through settings in the database and adds them to the session and rows. Although this operation involves database interactions, it does not perform any time-expensive or memory-expensive operations that would lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The code mainly reads settings data and populates session and rows, which is not performance-sensitive."
