    "Reason": "The configuration option is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts system performance by affecting query execution time and memory consumption. The code snippet initializes the session with database settings, including query cache size, which can significantly impact system responsiveness. The query cache size configuration involves memory-expensive operations as it stores cached statements, leading to notable performance variations at the system level."
