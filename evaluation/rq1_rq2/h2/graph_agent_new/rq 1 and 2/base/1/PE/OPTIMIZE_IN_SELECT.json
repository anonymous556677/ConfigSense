    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option OPTIMIZE_IN_SELECT is performance-sensitive. This is because it directly influences the behavior of the getValue method based on specific conditions related to comparison types and session settings. The code snippet shows that when the condition (all || compareType != Comparison.EQUAL || !session.getDatabase().getSettings().optimizeInSelect) is met, the method takes a different path, potentially impacting the performance of database operations. The configuration involves performance-related operations that can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, making it performance-sensitive."
