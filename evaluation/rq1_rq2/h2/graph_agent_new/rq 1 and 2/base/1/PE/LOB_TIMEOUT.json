    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option MAX_COMPACT_TIME is performance-sensitive because it directly affects the database compaction process during shutdown, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The code snippet provided shows that the configuration is used to determine the maximum time allowed for compaction, which can be time-expensive depending on the value set. This can impact the overall shutdown time of the system, making it a performance-sensitive configuration."
