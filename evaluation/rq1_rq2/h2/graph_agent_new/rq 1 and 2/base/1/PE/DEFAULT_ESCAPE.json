    "Reason": "The configuration option for getting the search string escape character does not involve any performance-related operations that are time-expensive or memory-expensive within its related code. It simply retrieves a predefined escape character from the database settings, which has minimal impact on system performance. Therefore, it does not lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
