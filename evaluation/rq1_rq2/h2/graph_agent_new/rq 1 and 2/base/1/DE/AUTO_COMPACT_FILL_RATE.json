    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The configuration code is used to set the database settings based on the input HashMap. It checks if the 'DATABASE_TO_LOWER' and 'DATABASE_TO_UPPER' settings are present and valid, and then sets the 'databaseToLower' and 'databaseToUpper' variables accordingly.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The triggering frequency of the 'AUTO_COMPACT_FILL_RATE' configuration depends on the average fill rate of the chunks in the MVStore engine. If the average fill rate is lower than the target fill rate set by the configuration, auto-compacting will be triggered to rewrite chunks with low fill rates.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the 'AUTO_COMPACT_FILL_RATE' configuration option is to optimize storage space usage by re-writing chunks with low fill rates and moving chunks at the end of the file if the empty space between chunks exceeds the target fill rate. This can improve performance by ensuring efficient storage usage and reducing fragmentation."
