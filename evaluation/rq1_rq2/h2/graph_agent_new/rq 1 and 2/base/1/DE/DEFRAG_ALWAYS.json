    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The DEFRAG_ALWAYS configuration setting in the code is used to determine whether the database should be fully defragmented each time it is closed normally. If DEFRAG_ALWAYS is set to true, the database will be fully defragmented on every normal closure, similar to the SHUTDOWN DEFRAG command. However, if the SHUTDOWN COMPACT command is executed, the DEFRAG_ALWAYS setting is ignored.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The triggering frequency of the DEFRAG_ALWAYS configuration in the system depends on how often the database is closed normally. If the database is frequently closed and opened, the DEFRAG_ALWAYS setting will be triggered more often.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the DEFRAG_ALWAYS configuration option on the system is that it can potentially increase the time taken to close the database, as full defragmentation can be a resource-intensive process. This setting may be useful for maintaining optimal database performance by ensuring that the database is consistently defragmented, but it may also lead to increased system overhead."
