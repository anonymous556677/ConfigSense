    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The DB_CLOSE_ON_EXIT configuration is related to closing the database when the virtual machine exits normally. In the code snippet provided, the configuration is not directly referenced, but it seems to be a part of the overall database settings handled in the DbSettings constructor. The configuration likely affects the behavior of the database shutdown process when the virtual machine exits.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The triggering frequency of the DB_CLOSE_ON_EXIT configuration would depend on how often the virtual machine exits normally in the system. If the system frequently restarts or shuts down, the configuration would be triggered more often.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the DB_CLOSE_ON_EXIT configuration on the system would be related to the database management and resource usage. If the configuration is set to true, the database will be closed when the virtual machine exits, which can help in releasing resources and ensuring data integrity. However, if the configuration is set to false, the database may remain open even after the virtual machine exits, potentially leading to resource leaks or data inconsistencies."
