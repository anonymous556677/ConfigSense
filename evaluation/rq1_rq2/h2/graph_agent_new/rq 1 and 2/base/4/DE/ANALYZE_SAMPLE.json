    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The configuration code is used to set the sample size when analyzing a table in the database. It retrieves the value of the configuration setting ANALYZE_SAMPLE from the database settings and uses it to determine the sample size for table analysis.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The configuration is triggered when the analyzeTables method is called and certain conditions are met, such as tablesToAnalyze not being null and the current thread holding a lock. The frequency of triggering depends on how often the analyzeTables method is called with the necessary conditions.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the configuration option ANALYZE_SAMPLE is on the efficiency and accuracy of table analysis. Setting a higher sample size can lead to more accurate analysis results but may also increase the processing time and resource usage. Conversely, setting a lower sample size may result in faster analysis but with potentially less accurate results."
