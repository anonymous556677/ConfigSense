    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The configuration MAX_QUERY_TIMEOUT is used to set the maximum timeout for a query in milliseconds. The setQueryTimeout method checks if the provided queryTimeout value is within the maximum limit specified in the database settings. If the provided value exceeds the maximum or is 0, it sets the queryTimeout to the maximum value. The cancelAtNs variable is also reset to 0 after setting the queryTimeout.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The triggering frequency of the MAX_QUERY_TIMEOUT configuration depends on how often the setQueryTimeout method is called in the system. If there are frequent calls to setQueryTimeout with different timeout values, the configuration will be triggered more often.",

Setting a lower value for MAX_QUERY_TIMEOUT can potentially lead to queries being terminated prematurely, while setting a higher value can increase the overall query execution time."
