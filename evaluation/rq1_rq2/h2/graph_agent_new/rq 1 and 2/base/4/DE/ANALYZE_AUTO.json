Running ANALYZE automatically for tables can help optimize query performance by updating statistics, but it also adds overhead to the system as it involves analyzing the table data. Setting the value too low may result in frequent ANALYZE operations, impacting system performance, while setting it too high may lead to outdated statistics and suboptimal query performance."
