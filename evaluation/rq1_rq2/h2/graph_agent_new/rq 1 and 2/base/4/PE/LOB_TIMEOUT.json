    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'LOB_TIMEOUT' configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly affects the system performance at the system level. The code snippet related to the 'LOB_TIMEOUT' configuration involves time-expensive operations, such as calculating the 'keepYoungerThan' value based on the 'lobTimeout' setting from the database settings. This calculation can lead to notable performance variations, especially when determining the maximum time allowed for compacting a database when closing. Therefore, the 'LOB_TIMEOUT' configuration is considered performance-sensitive."
