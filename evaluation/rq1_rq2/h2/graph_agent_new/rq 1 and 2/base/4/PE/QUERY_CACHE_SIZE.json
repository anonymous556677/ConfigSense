    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option QUERY_CACHE_SIZE is considered performance-sensitive. This is because the size of the query cache directly impacts the system performance by affecting the frequency of query executions and the utilization of memory resources. The code snippet related to the configuration shows that the queryCacheSize is set at the session level, indicating that it can have a significant impact on the execution time and memory consumption of the system. Additionally, the developer's explanation highlights that the configuration can improve performance by reducing the need to re-execute identical queries, which further emphasizes its performance sensitivity."
