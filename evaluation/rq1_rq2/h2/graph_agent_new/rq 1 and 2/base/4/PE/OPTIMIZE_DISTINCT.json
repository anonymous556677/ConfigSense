    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option OPTIMIZE_DISTINCT is performance-sensitive. The code related to this configuration involves optimizing distinct queries by applying specific conditions to improve query execution time. The optimization logic directly impacts the performance of distinct queries at the system level by reducing processing time. The configuration involves time-expensive operations like checking for specific conditions, applying optimizations, and setting indexes, which lead to notable performance variations in query execution."
