    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration OPTIMIZE_EVALUATABLE_SUBQUERIES is considered performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly impacts the optimization of subqueries in the code, which can have a notable performance variation at the system level. Enabling this configuration can improve query performance by optimizing subqueries, but it may also introduce additional processing overhead depending on the complexity of the queries and the amount of subqueries being optimized. The code snippet related to this configuration checks if the session database settings have this configuration enabled and returns false if it is not enabled, indicating that it involves time-expensive operations related to query optimization."
