    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option ANALYZE_SAMPLE is classified as performance-sensitive. This is because the code snippet related to this configuration involves fetching the value of ANALYZE_SAMPLE from the database settings and using it to determine the sample size for table analysis. The operation of setting the sample size directly impacts the efficiency and accuracy of table analysis, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Additionally, the operation of analyzing tables can be time-expensive and memory-expensive, especially when dealing with large datasets, further contributing to the performance sensitivity of this configuration."
