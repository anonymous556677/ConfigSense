    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The MAX_QUERY_TIMEOUT configuration is not performance-sensitive based on the provided code context and developer information. The setQueryTimeout method only checks and sets the queryTimeout value based on the maximum limit specified in the database settings. It does not involve any time-expensive or memory-expensive operations that would lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Additionally, the impact of this configuration is limited to setting the maximum timeout for queries and does not directly affect overall system performance."
