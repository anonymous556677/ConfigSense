    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The configuration option DATABASE_TO_LOWER is not performance-sensitive. The code related to this configuration involves converting database identifiers to lower case based on the database settings. This operation is not time-expensive or memory-expensive and does not lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The impact of enabling this option is minimal and only affects the formatting of database identifiers, with a slight increase in processing time for the conversion."
