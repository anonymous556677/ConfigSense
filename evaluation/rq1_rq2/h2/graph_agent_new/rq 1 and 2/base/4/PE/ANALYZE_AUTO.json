    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'ANALYZE_AUTO' configuration option is classified as performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly impacts the system performance by automatically triggering the ANALYZE operation for a table based on the number of rows changed. The code snippet reveals that the 'nextAnalyze' variable is set to 'database.getSettings().analyzeAuto', indicating that the frequency of ANALYZE operation is determined by this configuration. Running ANALYZE automatically can have a significant performance impact as it involves analyzing table data and updating statistics, which can affect query performance. Setting the value too low may lead to frequent ANALYZE operations, impacting system performance, while setting it too high may result in outdated statistics and suboptimal query performance. Therefore, the 'ANALYZE_AUTO' configuration is considered performance-sensitive as it directly and substantially affects system performance at the system level."
