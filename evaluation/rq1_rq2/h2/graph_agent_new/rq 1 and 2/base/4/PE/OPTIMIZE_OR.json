    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The OPTIMIZE_OR configuration is performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration involves performance-related operations that optimize the code by converting OR conditions to IN conditions, potentially reducing the number of comparisons being made. This optimization can lead to improved query performance and optimization of SQL queries, resulting in notable performance variations at the system level."
