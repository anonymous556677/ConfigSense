    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The DEFAULT_ESCAPE configuration option is not performance-sensitive. The code context provided shows that the configuration retrieves the default escape character from the database settings, which is a simple operation that does not contribute significantly to execution time or memory consumption. The developer's understanding also indicates that the impact of this configuration is limited to the functionality that requires the default escape character in the system. Therefore, the configuration does not lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
