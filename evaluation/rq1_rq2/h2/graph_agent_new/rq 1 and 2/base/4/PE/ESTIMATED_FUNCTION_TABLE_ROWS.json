    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The 'ESTIMATED_FUNCTION_TABLE_ROWS' configuration is not performance-sensitive based on the provided code context and developer information. The configuration is used to determine the estimated number of rows in a function table, and its impact is limited to the optimizer for query optimization. The code snippet does not contain any performance-intensive operations related to this configuration that would lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Therefore, it is classified as not performance-sensitive."
