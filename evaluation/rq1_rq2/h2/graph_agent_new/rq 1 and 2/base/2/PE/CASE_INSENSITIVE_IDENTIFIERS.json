    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option CASE_INSENSITIVE_IDENTIFIERS is performance-sensitive. This is because the setting directly affects how identifier names are compared in the system, which can impact the behavior of methods like 'checkIndex' and 'column'. The 'checkIndex' method, for example, performs comparisons based on the case sensitivity of identifiers, which can result in different execution paths depending on the configuration setting. Therefore, changing this configuration can have a substantial impact on system performance at the system level."
