    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'ESTIMATED_FUNCTION_TABLE_ROWS' configuration is considered performance-sensitive. This is because the estimated number of rows directly impacts the cost estimation process in the system, which can lead to different query execution plans and affect overall system performance. The code context shows that the configuration value is used in the calculation of cost, indicating its significance in system performance. The developer's explanation also highlights the importance of this configuration in determining query optimization strategies."
