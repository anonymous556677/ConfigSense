    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'RECOMPILE_ALWAYS' is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the system performance by potentially increasing compilation overhead. The code context shows that the needRecompile() method checks for the 'recompileAlways' setting in the database, which can lead to re-compilation of prepared statements. This can have a significant impact on system performance, especially if there are a large number of prepared statements being used."
