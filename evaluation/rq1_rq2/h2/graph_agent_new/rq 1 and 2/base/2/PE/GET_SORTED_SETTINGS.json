    "Reason": "The GET_SORTED_SETTINGS configuration option is not performance-sensitive because it retrieves settings from the database and adds them to the session and rows. It iterates over all settings and converts integer values to strings if necessary. This process is unlikely to have a substantial impact on system performance at the system level. The configuration-related code focuses on retrieving and processing settings data, which is a common and necessary operation without significant performance implications."
