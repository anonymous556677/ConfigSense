    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'OPTIMIZE_INSERT_FROM_SELECT' is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the efficiency of inserting data from a select query. When the configuration is true, it enables an optimization that bypasses temporary disk storage, leading to faster execution and reduced resource usage. This optimization can have a substantial effect on system performance at the system level by improving the overall efficiency of data insertion operations."
