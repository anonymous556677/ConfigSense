    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'LOB_TIMEOUT' is considered performance-sensitive based on the code context provided. The 'LOB_TIMEOUT' is directly used to calculate the 'keepYoungerThan' value, which is crucial for determining when to remove temporary lobs. The timeout value directly impacts the frequency of removing temporary lobs, which can have a significant impact on system performance. Setting a higher timeout value may lead to increased memory usage and potentially affect system performance. Therefore, the 'LOB_TIMEOUT' configuration is performance-sensitive at the system level."
