    "Reason": "The OPTIMIZE_IN_SELECT configuration is considered performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the performance of comparison operations involving IN(SELECT ...) by optimizing the execution of SELECT, DELETE, and UPDATE queries. The code context provided shows that the configuration setting is used to determine whether to optimize the query execution path based on the session settings. This optimization can have a substantial impact on system performance at the query execution level, making it a performance-sensitive configuration."
