    "Reason": "The configuration MAX_QUERY_TIMEOUT does not directly and substantially affect system performance at the system level. It simply ensures that the query timeout does not exceed the maximum value set in the database settings. The code snippet provided only checks and sets the queryTimeout value based on the maximum value, which does not have a significant impact on system performance. Therefore, the configuration is not considered performance-sensitive."
