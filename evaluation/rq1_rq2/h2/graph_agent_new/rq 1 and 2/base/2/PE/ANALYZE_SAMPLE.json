    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option ANALYZE_SAMPLE is considered performance-sensitive. This is because the sample size specified in the ANALYZE_SAMPLE configuration directly affects the efficiency and accuracy of table analysis at the system level. A higher sample size can lead to more accurate results but may also increase processing time and resource usage, while a lower sample size may result in faster analysis but with potentially less accurate results. The code context provided shows that the sample size is used in the analyzeTable() method to analyze tables in the database, indicating a direct impact on system performance."
