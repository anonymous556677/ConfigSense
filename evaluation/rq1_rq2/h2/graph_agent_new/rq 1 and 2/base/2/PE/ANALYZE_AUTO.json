    "Reason": "The configuration option 'ANALYZE_AUTO' is considered performance-sensitive. This is because the setting directly impacts the performance of the database system by automatically running the ANALYZE operation at regular intervals based on the number of changes made to a table. This operation helps in optimizing query performance by updating query planner statistics. Additionally, the code context reveals that the configuration setting is tied to system-level operations such as creating indexes and managing transaction stores, further emphasizing its impact on system performance."
