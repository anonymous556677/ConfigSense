    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The configuration MAX_QUERY_TIMEOUT is used to set the maximum timeout for a query in milliseconds. The code snippet provided checks if the queryTimeout value exceeds the maximum set in the database settings, and if so, it sets the queryTimeout to the maximum value. The cancelAtNs variable is also reset after setting the queryTimeout.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The configuration MAX_QUERY_TIMEOUT is triggered whenever the setQueryTimeout method is called to set the query timeout value. The frequency of triggering depends on how often this method is called in the system.",

This helps in preventing queries from running indefinitely and potentially causing performance issues in the system."
