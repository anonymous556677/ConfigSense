Each session has its own cache with the specified size. The cache is utilized when the SQL statement and all parameters match, and only the last returned result per query is cached. Various types of statements are cached, including SELECT statements (excluding UNION and FOR UPDATE statements), CALL if it returns a single value, DELETE, INSERT, MERGE, UPDATE, and transactional statements like COMMIT. Both statements and prepared statements are cached.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The QUERY_CACHE_SIZE configuration is triggered whenever a session executes a query that matches the criteria for caching. The frequency of triggering depends on the number of queries executed by sessions and the matching parameters.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the QUERY_CACHE_SIZE configuration on the system is significant in terms of performance optimization. By caching query results, the system can reduce the need to re-execute queries with identical parameters, thereby improving response times and overall system efficiency. However, a larger cache size may consume more memory resources, so it's essential to balance the cache size with available system resources."
