    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The RECOMPILE_ALWAYS configuration option is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts system performance by causing prepared statements to be recompiled every time they are executed. This can lead to increased CPU usage and potentially slower execution times, which are notable performance variations at the system level. The needRecompile method in the code context also includes performance-related operations that are time-expensive, such as checking the modificationMetaId and recompileAlways settings, further indicating the performance sensitivity of this configuration."
