    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option ANALYZE_SAMPLE is performance-sensitive. The code snippet provided shows that the value of ANALYZE_SAMPLE is used as the sample size when analyzing tables. This operation involves iterating through tables and analyzing them, which can be time-expensive and memory-expensive. The size impact mentioned by the developer also indicates that a larger sample size can increase processing time and resource usage, further emphasizing the performance sensitivity of this configuration."
