    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option ESTIMATED_FUNCTION_TABLE_ROWS is classified as performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the configuration directly impacts the performance of query optimization by determining the estimated number of rows in a function table. This estimation is crucial for the optimizer to generate efficient query execution plans. The code snippet provided shows that the configuration is used to calculate the cost of operations, which can have a significant impact on the overall system performance. Therefore, the configuration involves performance-related operations that are time-expensive and memory-expensive, leading to notable performance variations at the system level."
