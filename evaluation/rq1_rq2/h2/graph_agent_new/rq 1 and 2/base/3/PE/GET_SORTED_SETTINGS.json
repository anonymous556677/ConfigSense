    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration code retrieves settings from the database, which involves multiple iterations over settings and system properties. These operations can be time-expensive and memory-expensive, especially when dealing with a large number of settings. Additionally, the code includes system information retrieval, which can further impact performance. Overall, the configuration involves performance-related operations that contribute to notable performance variations at the system level."
