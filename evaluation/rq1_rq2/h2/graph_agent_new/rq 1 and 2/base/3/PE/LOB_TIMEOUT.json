    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'LOB_TIMEOUT' configuration is performance-sensitive. The code snippet provided shows that the configuration is used to calculate the 'keepYoungerThan' value based on the 'lobTimeout' setting, which directly impacts the efficiency of database compaction during closing. The 'lobTimeout' setting affects the frequency of database compaction, which can have a notable performance impact on the system level. Additionally, the code snippet contains operations that are time-expensive, such as the loop to check and remove temporary lobs based on the 'lobTimeout' value, further indicating the performance sensitivity of the configuration."
