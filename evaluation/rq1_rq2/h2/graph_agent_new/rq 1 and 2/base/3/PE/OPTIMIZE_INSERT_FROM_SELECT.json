    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option OPTIMIZE_INSERT_FROM_SELECT is performance-sensitive. The code context shows that when the setting optimizeInsertFromSelect is true, it bypasses temporary disk storage and inserts directly into the table from the query. This operation can have a notable performance impact at the system level by potentially reducing disk I/O operations and improving overall system efficiency. Additionally, the code contains performance-related operations such as query execution and result handling, which are time-expensive and memory-expensive, contributing to notable performance variations."
