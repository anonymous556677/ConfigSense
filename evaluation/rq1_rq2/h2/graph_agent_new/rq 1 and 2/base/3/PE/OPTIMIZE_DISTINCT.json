    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option OPTIMIZE_DISTINCT is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the configuration directly impacts the performance of distinct queries by applying optimization logic based on specific conditions. The code context shows that the configuration involves optimizing expressions, cleaning up order, and creating index conditions, which are time-expensive and memory-expensive operations. These operations can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, making the configuration performance-sensitive."
