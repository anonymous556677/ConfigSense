    "Reason": "The DEFAULT_ESCAPE configuration option is not performance-sensitive. The code context provided shows that the configuration is mainly used to retrieve a single character from the database settings, which has minimal impact on system performance. The developer's understanding also indicates that the configuration is triggered in specific scenarios and does not involve time-expensive or memory-expensive operations that would lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
