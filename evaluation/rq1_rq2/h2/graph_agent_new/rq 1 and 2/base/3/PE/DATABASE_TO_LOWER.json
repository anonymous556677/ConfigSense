    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The configuration option DATABASE_TO_LOWER is not performance-sensitive based on the analysis of the code context. The conversion to lower case using StringUtils.toLowerEnglish() method is a relatively lightweight operation and does not lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The configuration is triggered only when an identifier needs to be converted to lower case, which is not a time-expensive or memory-expensive operation. Therefore, the configuration does not directly and substantially affect system performance, making it non-performance-sensitive."
