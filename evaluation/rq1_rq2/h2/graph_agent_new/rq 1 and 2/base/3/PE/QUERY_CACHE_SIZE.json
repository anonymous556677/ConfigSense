    "Reason": "The QUERY_CACHE_SIZE configuration is performance-sensitive. This is because the size of the query cache directly impacts the performance of the system at the system level. The code snippet provided shows that the queryCacheSize configuration is set based on the database settings, and it determines the size of the query cache in number of cached statements. The cache is utilized when SQL statements match, and only the last returned result per query is cached. This caching mechanism can significantly affect the execution time and memory consumption of the system by reducing the need to re-execute queries with identical parameters, thereby improving response times and overall system efficiency. Therefore, the configuration involves performance-related operations that are memory-expensive and time-expensive, leading to notable performance variations at the system level."
