    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The configuration option RECOMPILE_ALWAYS is used to determine if a statement needs to be re-compiled. It checks if the database is closed, and then compares the modificationMetaId with the database's modificationMetaId. If prepareAlways is true or modificationMetaId is less than the database's modificationMetaId or the database's recompileAlways setting is true, then the statement needs to be re-compiled.",

However, it ensures that the statements are always up-to-date with any changes in the database."
