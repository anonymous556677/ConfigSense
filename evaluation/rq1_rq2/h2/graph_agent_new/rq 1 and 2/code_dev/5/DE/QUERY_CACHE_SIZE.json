    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The QUERY_CACHE_SIZE configuration determines the size of the query cache in number of cached statements. Each session has its own cache with the specified size. The cache is used when the SQL statement and all parameters match, and only the last returned result per query is cached. Various statement types are cached, including SELECT, CALL (if it returns a single value), DELETE, INSERT, MERGE, UPDATE, and transactional statements like COMMIT.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The QUERY_CACHE_SIZE configuration is triggered whenever a session executes a SQL statement that matches the cache criteria. The frequency of triggering depends on the number of queries executed by sessions and the cache hit rate.",

However, setting a large cache size can consume more memory resources, while a small cache size may result in more frequent query executions."
