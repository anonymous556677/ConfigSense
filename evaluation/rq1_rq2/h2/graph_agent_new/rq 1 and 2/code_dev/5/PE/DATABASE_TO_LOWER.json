    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The configuration option DATABASE_TO_LOWER is not performance-sensitive. The code snippets related to this configuration involve simple string manipulation operations to convert identifiers to lower case when the setting is enabled. These operations are not time-expensive or memory-expensive and are unlikely to cause notable performance variations at the system level. The developer's understanding also indicates that the impact of this configuration on system performance is relatively small, further supporting the classification of non-performance-sensitive."
