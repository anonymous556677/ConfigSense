    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The MAX_QUERY_TIMEOUT configuration option does not directly involve any time-expensive or memory-expensive operations within its related code. The code snippet provided simply sets the query timeout value based on the maximum query timeout defined in the database settings, without any significant performance impact. Additionally, the configuration does not lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Therefore, it is classified as not performance-sensitive."
