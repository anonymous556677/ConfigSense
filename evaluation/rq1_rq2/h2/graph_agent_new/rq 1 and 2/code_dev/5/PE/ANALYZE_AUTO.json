    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option ANALYZE_AUTO is performance-sensitive. The code snippet shows that the configuration involves checking for large objects in columns and initializing a counter for the number of changes until the next ANALYZE operation. This initialization and tracking of changes can have a notable performance impact, especially if the ANALYZE operation is triggered frequently. From a system level perspective, running ANALYZE too frequently can introduce overhead and impact system performance. Therefore, the configuration is considered performance-sensitive due to its potential impact on system performance."
