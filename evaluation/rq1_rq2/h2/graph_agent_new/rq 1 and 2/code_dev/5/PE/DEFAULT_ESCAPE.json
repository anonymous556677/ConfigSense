    "Reason": "The DEFAULT_ESCAPE configuration option is not performance-sensitive. The configuration is only used to retrieve the default escape character from the database settings, and it is triggered in specific methods where the default escape parameter is needed. The impact of this configuration is limited to the functionality that requires the default escape character and does not have a significant performance impact at the system level. The code context provided does not contain any performance-intensive operations related to this configuration."
