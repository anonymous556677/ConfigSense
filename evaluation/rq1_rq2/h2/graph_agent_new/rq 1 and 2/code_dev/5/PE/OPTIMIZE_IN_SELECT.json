    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option OPTIMIZE_IN_SELECT is performance-sensitive. The code context provided shows that the configuration directly impacts the execution time of comparison operations by optimizing the query execution based on the optimizeInSelect flag. This optimization can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, making it a performance-sensitive configuration. The developer's understanding also confirms that the configuration is designed to improve performance by optimizing comparison operations, further supporting the classification as performance-sensitive."
