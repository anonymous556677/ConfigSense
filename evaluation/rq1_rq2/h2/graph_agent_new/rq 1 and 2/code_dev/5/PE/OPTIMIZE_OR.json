    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The OPTIMIZE_OR configuration is performance-sensitive. The configuration involves performance-related operations within its related code, specifically the optimization of OR conditions to IN clauses. This optimization can have a notable impact on system performance by reducing the cost of evaluating conditions and potentially speeding up query execution. Therefore, the configuration directly and substantially affects system performance at the system level, making it performance-sensitive."
