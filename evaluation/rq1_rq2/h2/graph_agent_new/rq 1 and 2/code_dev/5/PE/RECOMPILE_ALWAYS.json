    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option RECOMPILE_ALWAYS is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts system performance at the system level. The needRecompile method involves checking database status and comparing modificationMetaId, which are time-expensive operations. If RECOMPILE_ALWAYS is set to true, prepared statements will always be re-compiled, leading to potential performance variations due to increased compilation overhead. This configuration can cause notable performance variations at the system level by affecting the execution time and memory consumption of the system."
