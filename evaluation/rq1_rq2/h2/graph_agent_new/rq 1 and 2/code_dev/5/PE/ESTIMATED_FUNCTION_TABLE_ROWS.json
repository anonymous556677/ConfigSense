    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The 'ESTIMATED_FUNCTION_TABLE_ROWS' configuration is not performance-sensitive based on the provided code context and developer's explanation. The configuration is used to determine the estimated number of rows in a function table, which does not involve any time-expensive or memory-expensive operations. The configuration is only used to provide an estimated row count for the optimizer's decision-making process, and it does not directly and substantially affect system performance at the system level. Therefore, it does not lead to notable performance variations and should be classified as not performance-sensitive."
