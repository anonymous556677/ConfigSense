    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option OPTIMIZE_INSERT_FROM_SELECT is performance-sensitive. This is because the code context shows that when the configuration is true, an optimization for inserting from a select query directly without temporary disk storage is applied. This optimization directly impacts the execution time and memory consumption of the system by bypassing temporary storage operations. The configuration involves performance-related operations that significantly affect system performance at the system level, leading to notable performance variations. Therefore, it is classified as performance-sensitive."
