    "Reason": "The OPTIMIZE_IN_LIST configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly affects system performance at the system level by optimizing the performance of queries involving the optimization of IN(...) and IN(SELECT ...) comparisons. The code snippets related to this configuration involve time-expensive operations such as adding index conditions based on specific conditions, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Therefore, the configuration is considered performance-sensitive."
