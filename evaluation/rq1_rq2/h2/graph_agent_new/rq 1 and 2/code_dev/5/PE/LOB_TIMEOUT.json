    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The LOB_TIMEOUT configuration is considered performance-sensitive because it directly impacts system performance at the system level. The code snippet provided shows that the configuration is used to set a timeout for removing temporary large objects (LOBs) from the database. This operation involves time-expensive operations such as iterating through temporary LOBs and checking their timestamps against the timeout value. Depending on the value set for LOB_TIMEOUT, the frequency of LOB removal and database compacting can vary significantly, leading to notable performance variations at the system level. Therefore, the LOB_TIMEOUT configuration is classified as performance-sensitive."
