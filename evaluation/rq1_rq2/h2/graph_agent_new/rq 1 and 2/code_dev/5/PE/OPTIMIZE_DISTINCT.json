    "Reason": "The OPTIMIZE_DISTINCT configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the performance of distinct queries by optimizing them based on specific conditions. The code snippet related to this configuration includes operations that are time-expensive and memory-expensive, such as checking for specific conditions, optimizing expressions, and setting indexes. These operations can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, making the configuration performance-sensitive."
