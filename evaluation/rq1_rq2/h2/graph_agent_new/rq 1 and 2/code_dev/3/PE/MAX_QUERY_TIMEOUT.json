    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The MAX_QUERY_TIMEOUT configuration option is not performance-sensitive based on the provided code context and developer's understanding. The code snippet provided does not contain any performance-related operations that significantly impact system performance. The configuration simply ensures that the queryTimeout value does not exceed the maximum value specified in the database settings, which does not lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Additionally, the developer's explanation of the configuration's impact on system performance also indicates that it is more focused on limiting query timeouts rather than causing significant performance variations."
