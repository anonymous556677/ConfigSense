    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The configuration option ANALYZE_SAMPLE is not performance-sensitive based on the provided code context and developer information. The code snippet related to this configuration does not contain any performance-intensive operations that would lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The configuration is simply used to determine the sample size for table analysis, which does not directly and substantially affect system performance. Additionally, the developer's explanation of the configuration's impact on table analysis suggests that the performance impact is related to the accuracy of analysis results rather than significant performance variations."
