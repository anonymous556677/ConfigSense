    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The configuration option RECOMPILE_ALWAYS is not performance-sensitive based on the provided code context and developer's information. The needRecompile() method checks if a statement needs to be re-compiled based on certain conditions, but these conditions do not involve any time-expensive or memory-expensive operations that would lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The configuration does not directly and substantially affect system performance, and the triggering frequency and size impact mentioned by the developer do not indicate significant performance implications."
