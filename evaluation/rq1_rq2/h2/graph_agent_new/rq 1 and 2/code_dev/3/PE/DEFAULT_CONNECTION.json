    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The DEFAULT_CONNECTION configuration does not involve any performance-sensitive operations within its related code. The configuration mainly determines whether Java functions can use a default connection for database operations, which does not directly and substantially affect system performance at the system level. The code snippet provided does not show any time-expensive or memory-expensive operations related to this configuration, leading to notable performance variations. Therefore, based on the code context and developer's information, the DEFAULT_CONNECTION configuration is classified as not performance-sensitive."
