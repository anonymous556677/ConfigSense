    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option QUERY_CACHE_SIZE is performance-sensitive. This is because the size of the query cache directly impacts the performance of the system by reducing the need to re-execute identical SQL statements, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Additionally, the code snippet provided shows that the queryCacheSize configuration is initialized in the SessionLocal constructor, indicating that it is a key parameter in the session initialization process and can have a significant impact on the overall performance of the system."
