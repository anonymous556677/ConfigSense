    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option OPTIMIZE_DISTINCT is performance-sensitive. This is because it directly affects the performance of distinct queries by optimizing them based on specific conditions within the code. The optimization process involves checking for conditions like single column queries, ascending indexes, and selectivity below 20, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The code snippet contains operations that are time-expensive and memory-expensive, such as index lookups and query optimizations, which can have a significant impact on system performance."
