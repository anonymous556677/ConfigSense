    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The OPTIMIZE_OR configuration option is performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly affects the performance of the system by optimizing expressions through converting OR conditions to IN conditions. This optimization process can lead to notable performance variations at the system level by reducing the cost of evaluating expressions, which are time-expensive and memory-expensive operations. The configuration involves performance-related operations within its related code that have a substantial impact on system performance, making it performance-sensitive."
