    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'LOB_TIMEOUT' configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly affects system performance at the system level. The code snippet related to the 'LOB_TIMEOUT' configuration involves time-expensive operations, such as calculating the 'keepYoungerThan' value based on the 'lobTimeout' setting. This calculation can lead to notable performance variations, especially when the 'removeTemporaryLobs' method is frequently called during system operation. Therefore, the 'LOB_TIMEOUT' configuration is considered performance-sensitive due to its direct impact on system performance and the time-expensive operations within its related code."
