    "Reason": "The 'ESTIMATED_FUNCTION_TABLE_ROWS' configuration is not performance-sensitive based on the provided code context and developer's information. The configuration is used to determine the estimated number of rows in a function table, which does not involve any performance-intensive operations that would lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The configuration simply retrieves a value from the database settings when the table row count cannot be obtained, and the impact is limited to query optimization based on the estimated row count."
