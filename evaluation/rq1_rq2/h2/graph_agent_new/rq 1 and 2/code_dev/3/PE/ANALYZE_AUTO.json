    "Reason": "The configuration option ANALYZE_AUTO is not performance-sensitive based on the provided code context and developer's information. The code snippet initializes the changesUntilAnalyze variable with the value of ANALYZE_AUTO from the database settings, which does not involve any time-expensive or memory-expensive operations. The developer's explanation also indicates that the impact of ANALYZE_AUTO is to maintain optimal query performance by updating query planner statistics, which suggests a trivial performance impact rather than a notable performance variation at the system level."
