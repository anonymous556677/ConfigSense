    "Reason": "The configuration option DEFAULT_ESCAPE is not performance-sensitive. The code snippet provided shows that the configuration is simply retrieving the defaultEscape value from the database settings and using it for search string escape. This operation does not involve any time-expensive or memory-expensive operations that would lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The impact of this configuration is limited to the functionality related to search string escape and does not have a significant performance impact."
