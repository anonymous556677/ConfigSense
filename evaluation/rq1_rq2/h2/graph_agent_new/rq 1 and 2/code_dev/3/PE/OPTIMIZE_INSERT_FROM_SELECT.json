    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration OPTIMIZE_INSERT_FROM_SELECT is performance-sensitive because it directly affects system performance at the system level. The code context shows that when the setting db.getSettings().optimizeInsertFromSelect is true, certain optimizations are applied to insert operations from select queries, potentially bypassing temporary disk storage. This optimization can lead to notable performance variations by reducing disk I/O and improving query execution speed, making it a performance-sensitive configuration."
