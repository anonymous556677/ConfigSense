    "Reason": "The configuration option DATABASE_TO_LOWER is not performance-sensitive based on the provided code context and developer's information. The conversion of identifiers to lowercase using StringUtils.toLowerEnglish() method is a simple operation that does not significantly impact system performance. The configuration setting is checked at various points in the code where identifiers are used, but the operation itself is not time-expensive or memory-expensive. Therefore, it does not lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
