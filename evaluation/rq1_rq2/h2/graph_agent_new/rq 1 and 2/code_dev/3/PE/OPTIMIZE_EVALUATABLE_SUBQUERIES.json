    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration OPTIMIZE_EVALUATABLE_SUBQUERIES is performance-sensitive. This is because it directly affects system performance by optimizing subqueries that are not dependent on the outer query. The code context shows that if this configuration is not enabled, the method will return false, indicating that the optimization of evaluatable subqueries is crucial for system performance. By enabling this configuration, it can lead to notable performance improvements in query execution, making it a performance-sensitive configuration."
