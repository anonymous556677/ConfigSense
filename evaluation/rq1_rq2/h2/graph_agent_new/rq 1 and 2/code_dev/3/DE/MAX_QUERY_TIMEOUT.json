    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The configuration MAX_QUERY_TIMEOUT is used to set the maximum timeout for a query in milliseconds. The code snippet provided ensures that the queryTimeout value is at most the maximum value specified in the database settings. If the maximum value is not 0 and is less than the queryTimeout or if the queryTimeout is 0, then the queryTimeout is set to the maximum value. The cancelAtNs is reset to 0 after setting the queryTimeout.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The triggering frequency of the MAX_QUERY_TIMEOUT configuration depends on how often the setQueryTimeout method is called in the system. If this method is called frequently to set the query timeout for different queries, then the configuration will be triggered more often.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the MAX_QUERY_TIMEOUT configuration option is that it limits the maximum timeout for a query. Setting a lower value for MAX_QUERY_TIMEOUT can potentially improve system performance by preventing long-running queries from consuming excessive resources. However, setting a very low value may also lead to queries being prematurely terminated."
