    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The configuration option RECOMPILE_ALWAYS is used to determine if a statement needs to be re-compiled. It is checked in the needRecompile() method where it returns true if the statement must be re-compiled. It is based on the value of prepareAlways, the modificationMetaId compared to the database's modificationMetaId, and the database's recompileAlways setting.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The triggering frequency of the RECOMPILE_ALWAYS configuration in the system depends on the conditions in the needRecompile() method. It is triggered whenever a statement needs to be re-compiled, which can happen when prepareAlways is true, the modificationMetaId is less than the database's modificationMetaId, or the database's recompileAlways setting is true.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the RECOMPILE_ALWAYS configuration option on the system is that it can potentially increase the workload on the system by requiring statements to be re-compiled more frequently. This can impact performance and resource usage, especially if there are many statements that need to be re-compiled often."
