    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option OPTIMIZE_IN_LIST is performance-sensitive. This is because the code context shows that the configuration directly affects the performance of queries involving the use of the IN operator by optimizing the comparison process. The code snippets within the configuration-related code involve time-expensive operations such as filtering and adding index conditions based on certain conditions. These operations can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, making the configuration performance-sensitive."
