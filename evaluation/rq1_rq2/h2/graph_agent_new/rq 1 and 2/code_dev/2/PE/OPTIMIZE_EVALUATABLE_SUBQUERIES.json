    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option OPTIMIZE_EVALUATABLE_SUBQUERIES is performance-sensitive. The code context shows that this configuration directly impacts the evaluation of subqueries that are not dependent on the outer query. If the setting optimizeEvaluatableSubqueries is false, the method returns false, indicating that the optimization should not be applied. This directly affects the performance of query execution speed and efficiency at the system level. Therefore, the configuration is considered performance-sensitive as it has a notable impact on system performance."
