    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option OPTIMIZE_IN_SELECT is performance-sensitive. This is because enabling this configuration directly affects the performance of queries involving IN(SELECT ...) comparisons by applying optimizations within the code. The code context provided shows that the configuration involves performance-related operations such as optimizing query execution based on the setting 'optimizeInSelect'. These operations can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, making the configuration performance-sensitive."
