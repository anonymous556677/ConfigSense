    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'ANALYZE_SAMPLE' configuration is classified as performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the performance of table analysis operations at the system level. The code snippet provided shows that the configuration is used to calculate the rowCount for table analysis, which can significantly affect the execution time and resource consumption of the system. The sample size set by this configuration can lead to notable performance variations in terms of processing time and memory usage during table analysis. Therefore, the 'ANALYZE_SAMPLE' configuration is considered performance-sensitive based on its direct and substantial impact on system performance."
