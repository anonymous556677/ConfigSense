    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'GET_SORTED_SETTINGS' is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the code iterates over all settings in the database, retrieves their values, and includes additional information such as build ID, version, and system properties. This process involves fetching information about the file store and cache statistics, which can contribute to notable performance variations at the system level due to the amount of data being processed and the potential impact on execution time and memory consumption."
