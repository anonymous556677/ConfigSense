    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The LOB_TIMEOUT configuration is considered performance-sensitive because it directly affects the system performance at the system level. The code snippet provided shows that the LOB_TIMEOUT value is used to calculate the 'keepYoungerThan' variable, which is then used to determine whether temporary result lobs should be removed based on the timeout condition. This operation of checking and removing temporary lobs based on the timeout condition can lead to notable performance variations, especially if the timeout value is set to a significantly short duration. Therefore, the configuration is performance-sensitive as it involves time-expensive operations within its related code that can impact system performance."
