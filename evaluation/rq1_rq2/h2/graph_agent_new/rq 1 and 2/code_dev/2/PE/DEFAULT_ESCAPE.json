    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'DEFAULT_ESCAPE' does not involve any performance-related operations that are time-expensive or memory-expensive within its related code. The developer's understanding also indicates that this configuration is used to retrieve the default escape character from the database settings, which does not directly and substantially affect system performance at the system level. Therefore, based on the code context and developer's information, the 'DEFAULT_ESCAPE' configuration is classified as not performance-sensitive."
