    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The OPTIMIZE_DISTINCT configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts system performance by optimizing distinct queries based on specific conditions. The code snippet related to this configuration involves time-expensive operations such as checking for specific conditions like selectivity below 20 and applying optimizations accordingly. These optimizations can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, making it a performance-sensitive configuration."
