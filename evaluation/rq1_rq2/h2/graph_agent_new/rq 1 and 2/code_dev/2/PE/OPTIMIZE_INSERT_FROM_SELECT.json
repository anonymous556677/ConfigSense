    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option OPTIMIZE_INSERT_FROM_SELECT is performance-sensitive. This is because the code context shows that when the database setting optimizeInsertFromSelect is true, specific optimizations are applied to the insert operation, potentially bypassing temporary disk storage. This optimization can directly impact system performance by improving efficiency and query execution speed. Therefore, the configuration directly and substantially affects system performance at the system level, making it performance-sensitive."
