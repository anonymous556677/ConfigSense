    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option OPTIMIZE_OR is performance-sensitive. The optimization performed by OPTIMIZE_OR directly impacts the execution time and memory consumption of the system by converting logical OR operations to more efficient IN clauses. This optimization can lead to notable performance improvements in query processing. Additionally, the code context shows that the configuration involves performance-related operations that are time-expensive and memory-expensive, such as optimizing comparisons and conditions. Therefore, the configuration is considered performance-sensitive based on its direct and substantial effect on system performance at the system level."
