    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The configuration option MAX_QUERY_TIMEOUT is not performance-sensitive based on the provided code context and developer information. The setQueryTimeout method simply checks and sets the query timeout value to ensure it does not exceed the maximum configured value. This operation does not involve any time-expensive or memory-expensive operations that would lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Additionally, the impact of the MAX_QUERY_TIMEOUT configuration is limited to setting a maximum timeout value for queries and does not directly and substantially affect system performance."
