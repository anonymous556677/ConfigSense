    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The configuration option DATABASE_TO_LOWER is not performance-sensitive based on the provided code context and developer's information. The operation of converting identifiers to lower case using StringUtils.toLowerEnglish() method is a simple and straightforward operation that is unlikely to cause notable performance variations at the system level. The configuration is only triggered when identifiers are used, and the impact on system performance is minimal. Therefore, it does not directly and substantially affect system performance or lead to significant performance variations."
