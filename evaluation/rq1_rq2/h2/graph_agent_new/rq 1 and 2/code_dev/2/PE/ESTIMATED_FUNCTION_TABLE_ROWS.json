    "Reason": "The 'ESTIMATED_FUNCTION_TABLE_ROWS' configuration is not performance-sensitive based on the provided code context and developer information. The configuration is used to estimate the number of rows in a function table, and its impact is limited to the optimizer's decision-making process. The code snippet shows that the configuration is used to set the expected number of rows, which is then multiplied by a constant factor and returned as the cost. This operation does not involve any time-expensive or memory-expensive operations that would lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Therefore, the configuration is not considered performance-sensitive."
