    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the QUERY_CACHE_SIZE configuration option is that it can affect the memory usage of the system. A larger cache size can improve performance by reducing the need to re-execute queries, but it can also increase memory usage. On the other hand, a smaller cache size may save memory but could result in more frequent query executions."
