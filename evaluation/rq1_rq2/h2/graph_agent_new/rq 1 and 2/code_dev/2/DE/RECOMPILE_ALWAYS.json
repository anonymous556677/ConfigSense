    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The configuration option RECOMPILE_ALWAYS is used in the code to determine if a statement needs to be re-compiled. It checks if the database is closed, and then checks if it needs to recompile based on certain conditions like prepareAlways flag, modificationMetaId, and db.getSettings().recompileAlways.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The configuration option RECOMPILE_ALWAYS is triggered whenever a prepared statement needs to be compiled. This can happen multiple times during the execution of the system, depending on the frequency of prepared statement executions.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the RECOMPILE_ALWAYS configuration option on the system is that it can potentially increase the CPU and memory usage as prepared statements are recompiled every time they are executed. This can lead to performance overhead, especially if there are a large number of prepared statements being used in the system."
