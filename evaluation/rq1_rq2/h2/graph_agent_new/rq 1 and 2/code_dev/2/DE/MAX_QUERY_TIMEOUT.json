    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The configuration MAX_QUERY_TIMEOUT is triggered whenever a query timeout value is set or updated in the system. The frequency of triggering depends on how often query timeouts are set or changed.",

Setting a lower value for MAX_QUERY_TIMEOUT can potentially improve system performance by preventing long-running queries from consuming excessive resources."
