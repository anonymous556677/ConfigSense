    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'GET_SORTED_SETTINGS' is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the code iterates through all the database settings and adds them to the session and rows. This operation involves multiple database queries and data processing, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, especially when dealing with a large number of settings. The code execution time and memory consumption can be impacted significantly by the number of settings and the complexity of the data being processed."
