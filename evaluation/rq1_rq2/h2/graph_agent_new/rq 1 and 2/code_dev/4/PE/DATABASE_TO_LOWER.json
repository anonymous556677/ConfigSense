{
    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The configuration option DATABASE_TO_LOWER is not performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the code snippets related to this configuration involve simple string manipulation operations for converting identifiers to lower case. These operations are not time-expensive or memory-expensive and do not lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The configuration mainly affects the case sensitivity of identifiers, which does not have a significant impact on overall system performance."
