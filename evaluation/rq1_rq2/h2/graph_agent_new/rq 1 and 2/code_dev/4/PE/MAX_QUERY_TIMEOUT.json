    "Reason": "The configuration option MAX_QUERY_TIMEOUT does not directly involve any time-expensive or memory-expensive operations within its related code. The code snippet provided simply checks and sets the query timeout to the maximum configured value, which does not lead to notable performance variations at the system level. While the configuration ensures query timeouts do not exceed a certain limit, it does not have a substantial impact on system performance to be classified as performance-sensitive."
