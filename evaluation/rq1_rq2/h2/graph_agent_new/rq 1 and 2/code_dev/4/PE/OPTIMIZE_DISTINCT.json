    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option OPTIMIZE_DISTINCT is performance-sensitive because it directly affects system performance by optimizing distinct queries based on specific conditions. The code context shows that the configuration involves performance-related operations such as optimizing expressions, creating index conditions, and setting indexes for faster query execution. These operations contribute positively to execution time and memory consumption, leading to notable performance variations at the system level when the optimization criteria are met. Therefore, the configuration is considered performance-sensitive."
