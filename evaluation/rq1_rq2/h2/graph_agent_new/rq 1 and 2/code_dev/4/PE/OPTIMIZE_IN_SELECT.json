    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option OPTIMIZE_IN_SELECT is performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly affects the performance of comparison operations involving IN(SELECT ...) clauses by optimizing query execution. The code context provided shows that the configuration involves time-expensive operations such as query optimization and result processing, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Therefore, the configuration is considered performance-sensitive based on its impact on system performance and the performance-related operations within its related code."
