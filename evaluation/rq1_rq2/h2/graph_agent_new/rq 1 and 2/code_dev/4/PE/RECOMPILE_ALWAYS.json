    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option RECOMPILE_ALWAYS is performance-sensitive. The needRecompile method checks for conditions that can trigger re-compilation of statements, leading to increased compilation overhead. This can have a notable impact on system performance, especially in scenarios where there are frequent statement compilations. The configuration directly affects system performance by potentially increasing execution time and memory consumption, making it performance-sensitive."
