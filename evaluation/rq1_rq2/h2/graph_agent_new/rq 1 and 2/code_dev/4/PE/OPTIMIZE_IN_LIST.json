    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The OPTIMIZE_IN_LIST configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly affects system performance at the system level. The code context shows that the configuration checks the session's database settings for the optimizeInList flag before applying optimization logic to improve the performance of queries involving IN(...) and IN(SELECT ...) comparisons. This optimization can lead to faster query execution and improved overall system performance, making it a performance-sensitive configuration."
