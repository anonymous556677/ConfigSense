    "Reason": "The 'OPTIMIZE_INSERT_FROM_SELECT' configuration is performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly affects the system performance by optimizing insert operations from select queries. The code snippet related to this configuration checks if the database setting 'optimizeInsertFromSelect' is true, and if so, it bypasses temporary disk storage and directly inserts into the table from the query. This optimization can lead to notable performance improvements by reducing disk I/O and improving overall system efficiency, making it a performance-sensitive configuration."
