    "Reason": "The configuration option DEFAULT_ESCAPE is not performance-sensitive. The code snippet provided simply retrieves the default escape character from the database settings, which is a trivial operation and does not have a significant impact on system performance. The configuration-related code does not involve any time-expensive or memory-expensive operations that would lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
