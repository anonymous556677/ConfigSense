    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The LOB_TIMEOUT configuration is considered performance-sensitive because it directly affects the efficiency of database compaction during closing, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The code snippet shows that the LOB_TIMEOUT value is used to calculate a threshold for removing temporary lobs based on a timeout value. This operation can be time-expensive depending on the value set for LOB_TIMEOUT, leading to significant performance impact. Therefore, the configuration is classified as performance-sensitive."
