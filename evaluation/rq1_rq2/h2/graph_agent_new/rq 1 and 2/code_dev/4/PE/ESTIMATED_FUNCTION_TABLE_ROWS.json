    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The 'ESTIMATED_FUNCTION_TABLE_ROWS' configuration is not performance-sensitive based on the provided code context and developer information. The configuration is used to estimate the number of rows in a function table, which is a static calculation and does not involve any time-expensive or memory-expensive operations. The configuration directly fetches the value from the database settings when needed, and the calculation itself is straightforward without causing notable performance variations at the system level. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria of being performance-sensitive."
