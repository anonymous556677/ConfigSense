    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The configuration option ANALYZE_SAMPLE is not performance-sensitive based on the provided code context and developer information. The code snippet related to this configuration does not contain any performance-intensive operations that would lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The configuration is used to determine the sample size for table analysis, which is a relatively straightforward and non-resource-intensive task. Additionally, the developer's understanding of the configuration's impact on performance indicates that it is more focused on accuracy of analysis results rather than system performance. Therefore, the configuration is classified as not performance-sensitive."
