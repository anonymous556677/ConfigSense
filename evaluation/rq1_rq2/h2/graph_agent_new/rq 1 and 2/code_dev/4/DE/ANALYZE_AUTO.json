    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The configuration ANALYZE_AUTO is used to determine the frequency at which the ANALYZE operation is automatically run for a table in the database. The value of ANALYZE_AUTO specifies the number of row changes after which the ANALYZE operation is triggered.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The triggering frequency of the configuration ANALYZE_AUTO is based on the number of row changes specified in the configuration value. For example, if ANALYZE_AUTO is set to 1000, then the ANALYZE operation will be triggered after about 1000 changes to a table.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the configuration option ANALYZE_AUTO is that it affects the performance of the database by automatically running the ANALYZE operation for tables. This can help in optimizing query performance by updating statistics and improving query execution plans. However, running ANALYZE too frequently can also have a negative impact on performance due to the overhead of the operation."
