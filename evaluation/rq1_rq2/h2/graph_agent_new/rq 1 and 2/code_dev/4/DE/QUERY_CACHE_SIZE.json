    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The configuration QUERY_CACHE_SIZE is used to set the size of the query cache in the system. Each session has its own cache with the specified size. The cache is utilized when the SQL statement and all parameters match, and only the last returned result per query is cached. Various statement types such as SELECT, CALL, DELETE, INSERT, MERGE, UPDATE, and transactional statements like COMMIT are cached.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The triggering frequency of the QUERY_CACHE_SIZE configuration depends on the number of cached statements and the frequency of matching SQL statements with parameters in the system. The configuration is triggered whenever a query is executed and matches the cached statements criteria.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the QUERY_CACHE_SIZE configuration option on the system is significant in terms of performance optimization. By caching the results of frequently executed queries, the system can reduce the execution time and improve overall performance. However, setting a large cache size may consume more memory resources, while a small cache size may result in frequent re-execution of queries."
