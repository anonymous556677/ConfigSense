    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option OPTIMIZE_DISTINCT is performance-sensitive. This is because it directly affects the performance of distinct queries by applying optimization when specific conditions are met. The code snippet related to this configuration includes operations that are time-expensive and memory-expensive, such as checking for selectivity, applying indexes, and sorting data. These operations can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, making the configuration performance-sensitive."
