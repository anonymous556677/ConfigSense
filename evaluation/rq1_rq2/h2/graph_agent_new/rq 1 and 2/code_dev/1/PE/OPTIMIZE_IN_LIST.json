    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option OPTIMIZE_IN_LIST is performance-sensitive because it directly affects system performance at the system level. The code context provided shows that the configuration involves optimization for IN(...) and IN(SELECT ...) comparisons, which are time-expensive operations. The configuration triggers optimization for SELECT, DELETE, and UPDATE operations, which are critical for system performance. Therefore, the configuration's impact on improving query execution speed and overall system performance makes it performance-sensitive."
