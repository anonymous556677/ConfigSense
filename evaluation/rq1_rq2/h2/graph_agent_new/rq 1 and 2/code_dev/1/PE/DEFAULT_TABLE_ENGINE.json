    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The DEFAULT_TABLE_ENGINE configuration is performance-sensitive. This is because the choice of table engine directly impacts the performance and storage efficiency of the system at the system level. The code context provided shows that the table engine is used when creating tables in the database, and the type of table engine chosen can have significant performance implications. Additionally, the code snippet related to the configuration involves time-expensive operations such as creating tables and determining the default table engine, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
