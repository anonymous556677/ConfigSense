    "Reason": "The configuration option 'GET_SORTED_SETTINGS' is not performance-sensitive. The code iterates through settings in the database and retrieves their values, which is a standard operation that does not involve any time-expensive or memory-expensive operations. The configuration-related code is focused on accessing and adding settings to the session and rows, which does not introduce notable performance variations at the system level."
