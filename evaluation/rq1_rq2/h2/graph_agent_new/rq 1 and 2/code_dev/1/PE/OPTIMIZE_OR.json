    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The OPTIMIZE_OR configuration is performance-sensitive. The configuration involves optimizing OR conditions to use the more efficient IN operator, which can lead to notable performance improvements in query execution time and memory consumption. By reducing the number of comparisons needed, the configuration directly and substantially affects system performance at the system level. Additionally, the code context provided shows that the configuration involves time-expensive and memory-expensive operations, such as sorting expressions and optimizing combinations, which can lead to significant performance variations."
