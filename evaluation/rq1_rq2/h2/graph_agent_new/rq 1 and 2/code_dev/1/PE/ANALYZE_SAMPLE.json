    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option ANALYZE_SAMPLE is performance-sensitive. The code snippet provided shows that the value of ANALYZE_SAMPLE is used to determine the sample size for table analysis, which directly impacts the execution time and resource usage of the system. The configuration involves performance-related operations such as analyzing tables with a specific sample size, which can be time-expensive and memory-expensive. This can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, making it a performance-sensitive configuration."
