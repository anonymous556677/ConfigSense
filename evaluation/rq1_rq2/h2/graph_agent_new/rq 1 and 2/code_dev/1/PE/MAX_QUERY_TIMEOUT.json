    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The configuration option MAX_QUERY_TIMEOUT is not performance-sensitive based on the provided code context and developer's information. The code snippet provided only checks if the specified query timeout exceeds the maximum configured value and sets it to the maximum value if necessary. This operation does not involve any time-expensive or memory-expensive operations that would lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Additionally, the impact of this configuration is limited to setting a maximum timeout for queries and does not directly and substantially affect system performance in a significant way."
