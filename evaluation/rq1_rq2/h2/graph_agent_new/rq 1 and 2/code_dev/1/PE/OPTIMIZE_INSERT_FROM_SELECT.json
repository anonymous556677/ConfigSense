    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option OPTIMIZE_INSERT_FROM_SELECT is performance-sensitive. The code context shows that when the configuration is true, it triggers optimizations that directly impact the execution time and memory consumption of insert operations. By bypassing temporary disk storage, it can lead to notable performance improvements at the system level. The configuration directly affects the performance of the system by optimizing insert operations, making it a performance-sensitive configuration."
