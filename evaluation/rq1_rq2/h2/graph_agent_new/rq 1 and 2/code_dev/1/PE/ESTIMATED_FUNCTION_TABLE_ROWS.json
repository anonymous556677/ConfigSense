    "Reason": "The configuration option ESTIMATED_FUNCTION_TABLE_ROWS is not performance-sensitive based on the provided code context and developer's information. The configuration is used to determine the estimated number of rows in a function table, which is then used in calculating the cost of a query. While the configuration may impact query optimization process, it does not directly and substantially affect system performance at the system level. The code snippet provided does not contain any time-expensive or memory-expensive operations related to this configuration, and the configuration itself does not lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
