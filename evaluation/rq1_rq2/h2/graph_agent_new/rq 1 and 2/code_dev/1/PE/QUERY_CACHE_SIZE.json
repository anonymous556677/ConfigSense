    "Reason": "The QUERY_CACHE_SIZE configuration is classified as performance-sensitive. This is because the size of the query cache directly impacts the memory usage of the system, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The code snippet provided shows that the queryCacheSize configuration is set for each session, and a larger cache size can improve performance by reducing the need to re-execute queries. However, this also means that it consumes more memory. Therefore, changes in the QUERY_CACHE_SIZE configuration can have a significant impact on system performance, making it performance-sensitive."
