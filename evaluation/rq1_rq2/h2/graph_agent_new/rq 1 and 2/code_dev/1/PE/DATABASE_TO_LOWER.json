    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The configuration option DATABASE_TO_LOWER is not performance-sensitive. Although it involves converting database identifiers to lower case in multiple places in the code, the conversion operation itself is not time-expensive or memory-expensive. The configuration setting databaseToLower is checked before performing the conversion, and the conversion operation is a simple string manipulation that does not lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Therefore, the configuration is not considered performance-sensitive."
