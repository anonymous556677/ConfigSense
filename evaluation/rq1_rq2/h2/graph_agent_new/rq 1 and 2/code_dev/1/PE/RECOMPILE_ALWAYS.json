    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option RECOMPILE_ALWAYS is performance-sensitive. This is because setting it to true can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The needRecompile method checks for this configuration and triggers re-compilation of prepared statements based on certain conditions. This recompilation process can be time-expensive and memory-expensive, potentially impacting system performance significantly. Therefore, the configuration directly and substantially affects system performance, making it performance-sensitive."
