    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The 'DEFAULT_ESCAPE' configuration option is not performance-sensitive. The code context provided shows that this configuration is simply retrieving a single character from the database settings, which is a trivial operation with minimal impact on system performance. The developer's understanding also confirms that the impact on system size is minimal. Therefore, the configuration does not involve any time-expensive or memory-expensive operations that would lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
