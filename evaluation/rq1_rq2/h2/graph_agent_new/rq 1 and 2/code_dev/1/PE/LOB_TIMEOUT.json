    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The LOB_TIMEOUT configuration is considered performance-sensitive because it directly impacts system performance at the system level. The code snippet provided shows that the LOB_TIMEOUT value is used to calculate the timeout for removing temporary LOBs, which can have a significant impact on the execution time and memory consumption of the system. Depending on the value set for LOB_TIMEOUT, the processing time for database compaction during closing can vary, leading to notable performance variations at the system level. Therefore, the configuration is classified as performance-sensitive."
