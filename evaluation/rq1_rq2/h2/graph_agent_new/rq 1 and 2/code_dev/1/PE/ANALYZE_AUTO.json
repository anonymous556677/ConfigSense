    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'ANALYZE_AUTO' configuration is considered performance-sensitive because it directly affects the system performance by automatically running the ANALYZE operation on tables after a certain number of row changes. This operation can be time-expensive and memory-expensive, especially as the triggering frequency increases. The code snippet initializes the 'changesUntilAnalyze' variable based on this configuration, indicating its importance in the performance of the system. Therefore, the 'ANALYZE_AUTO' configuration can lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
