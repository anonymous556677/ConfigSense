Each session has its own cache with the specified size. The cache is utilized when the SQL statement and all parameters match, and only the last returned result per query is cached. Various statement types such as SELECT, CALL, DELETE, INSERT, MERGE, UPDATE, and transactional statements are cached.",

A larger cache size can improve performance by reducing the need to re-execute queries, but it also consumes more memory. On the other hand, a smaller cache size may save memory but could result in more frequent query executions."
