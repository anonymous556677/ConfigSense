    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The configuration option '_transactionDeepCopyMode' is classified as not performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that there is no clear indication in the provided code context that the '_transactionDeepCopyMode' configuration directly and substantially affects system performance at the system level. Additionally, the lack of information on the method body and its relation to performance-related operations makes it difficult to determine any time-expensive or memory-expensive operations that would lead to notable performance variations."
