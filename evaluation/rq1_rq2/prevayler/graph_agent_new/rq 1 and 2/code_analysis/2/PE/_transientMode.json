    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option '_transientMode' is performance-sensitive. The code context shows that the value of '_transientMode' directly impacts the type of Journal being created, either TransientJournal or PersistentJournal. Creating a PersistentJournal involves initializing a PrevaylerDirectory and setting various thresholds and parameters, which can have a notable performance impact. Therefore, the configuration '_transientMode' directly and substantially affects system performance at the system level by determining the type of Journal being used."
