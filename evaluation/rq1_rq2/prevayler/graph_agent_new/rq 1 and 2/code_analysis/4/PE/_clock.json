    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option '_clock' is performance-sensitive. The 'clock()' method is directly related to the configuration and determines which Clock object to use based on the value of '_clock'. This method involves a conditional check and object instantiation, which can have a performance impact. Depending on the value of '_clock', it can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, making it performance-sensitive."
