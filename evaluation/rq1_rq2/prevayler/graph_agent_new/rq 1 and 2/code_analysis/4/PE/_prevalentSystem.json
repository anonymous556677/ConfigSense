    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option _prevalentSystem is performance-sensitive. This is because the prevalentSystem() method is called within the snapshotManager() method, which is a critical part of managing snapshots in the system. The prevalentSystem() method likely involves performance-related operations that could be time-expensive or memory-expensive, leading to notable performance variations at the system level. Additionally, the configuration is directly related to the functionality of the GenericSnapshotManager, which plays a crucial role in system performance."
