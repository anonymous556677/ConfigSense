    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The configuration option _transactionDeepCopyMode is classified as not performance-sensitive based on the provided code context. There is no direct evidence in the code snippet to suggest that this configuration option leads to notable performance variations at the system level. The code snippet primarily focuses on creating a Prevayler instance based on other configuration methods, and the _transactionDeepCopyMode is simply passed as a parameter without any indication of time-expensive or memory-expensive operations related to it. Therefore, the configuration option is considered to have trivial or moderate performance impact, rather than directly and substantially affecting system performance."
