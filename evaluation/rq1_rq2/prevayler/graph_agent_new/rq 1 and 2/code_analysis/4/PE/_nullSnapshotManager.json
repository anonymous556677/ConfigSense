    "Reason": "The configuration option _nullSnapshotManager is performance-sensitive. The code snippet related to this configuration involves multiple conditional checks and object instantiations based on the state of _nullSnapshotManager. Depending on the state of _nullSnapshotManager, different objects are created and returned, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Additionally, the method prevalentSystem() ensures that the prevalent system is properly configured before proceeding with other operations, indicating the importance of configuration in system performance."
