    "Reason": "The configuration option '_snapshotSerializers' is not performance-sensitive. The code context provided does not contain any performance-related operations that are time-expensive or memory-expensive. The configuration method 'journalSerializer' simply returns a Serializer object based on whether a custom journalSerializer is set or not, which does not directly and substantially affect system performance at the system level."
