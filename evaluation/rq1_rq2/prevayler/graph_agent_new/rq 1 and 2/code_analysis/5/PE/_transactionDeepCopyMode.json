    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The configuration option '_transactionDeepCopyMode' is classified as not performance-sensitive based on the provided code context. The configuration is used as a parameter in the creation of a Prevayler instance, but there is no indication in the code snippet that it directly and substantially affects system performance at the system level. Additionally, the lack of information about the '_transactionDeepCopyMode' method and its relation to performance-related operations within the code further supports the classification of this configuration as not performance-sensitive."
