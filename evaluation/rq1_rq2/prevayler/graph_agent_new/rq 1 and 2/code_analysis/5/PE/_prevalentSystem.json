    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option '_prevalentSystem' is performance-sensitive. The code context shows that the 'prevalentSystem()' method is called within the 'snapshotManager()' method, and this method is critical for managing snapshots in the system. The 'prevalentSystem()' method is directly related to system performance as it is used to initialize the GenericSnapshotManager, which plays a crucial role in handling snapshots efficiently. Any inefficiencies or performance bottlenecks in this method can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Therefore, the configuration '_prevalentSystem' is considered performance-sensitive."
