    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option _journalDiskSync is performance-sensitive. The code context reveals that the _journalDiskSync configuration parameter is used in the creation of a PersistentJournal object, which involves disk synchronization operations. Disk synchronization operations are known to be time-expensive and can have a significant impact on system performance. Therefore, the _journalDiskSync configuration directly affects system performance at the system level by involving time-expensive operations related to disk synchronization."
