    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option _transientMode is performance-sensitive. The code context shows that the value of _transientMode directly determines which type of Journal to instantiate, either TransientJournal or PersistentJournal. This decision impacts the execution time and memory consumption of the system at the system level. Depending on the value of _transientMode, the system will either create a lightweight TransientJournal or a more resource-intensive PersistentJournal, leading to notable performance variations. Therefore, the configuration directly and substantially affects system performance, making it performance-sensitive."
