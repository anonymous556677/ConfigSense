    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option '_snapshotSerializers' is performance-sensitive. The code context shows that the '_snapshotSerializers' configuration directly affects the creation of the GenericSnapshotManager object, which is crucial for managing snapshots in the Prevayler system. Depending on the conditions and configurations checked in the snapshotManager() method, different snapshot management strategies are employed, which can have a notable impact on system performance at the system level. Therefore, the '_snapshotSerializers' configuration is considered performance-sensitive."
