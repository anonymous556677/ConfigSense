Otherwise, it returns a CentralPublisher with the current clock and journal.",

If _remoteServerIpAddress is not null, the ClientPublisher will be triggered. Otherwise, the CentralPublisher will be triggered.

If _remoteServerIpAddress is not null, a ClientPublisher is used, which may have different behavior and performance characteristics compared to a CentralPublisher. This choice can impact the communication and data flow within the system."
