    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The _journalSizeThreshold configuration is used in the journal method to determine the size threshold for the journal. When creating a PersistentJournal object, the _journalSizeThreshold value is passed as a parameter to set the size threshold for the journal.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The triggering frequency of the _journalSizeThreshold configuration depends on the usage of the journal method in the code. If the journal method is called frequently or if the system processes a large amount of data, the _journalSizeThreshold configuration will be triggered more often.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the _journalSizeThreshold configuration option on the system is significant as it determines the size threshold for the journal. Setting a lower threshold may result in more frequent journal rotations and potentially impact system performance, while setting a higher threshold may lead to larger journal files and potential storage issues."
