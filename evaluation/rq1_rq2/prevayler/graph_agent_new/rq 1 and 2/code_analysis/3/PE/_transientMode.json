{
    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option '_transientMode' is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the '_transientMode' directly impacts the performance of the system at the system level. In the code context provided, the '_transientMode' determines which type of Journal to instantiate, either a TransientJournal or a PersistentJournal. This decision directly affects the execution time and memory consumption of the system, leading to notable performance variations. Therefore, the '_transientMode' configuration is considered performance-sensitive."
