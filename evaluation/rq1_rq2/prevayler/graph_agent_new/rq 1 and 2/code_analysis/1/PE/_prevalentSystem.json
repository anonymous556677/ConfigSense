    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option _prevalentSystem is performance-sensitive. The prevalentSystem() method within the code context directly relates to the configuration by checking if the _prevalentSystem variable is null. This check is crucial for the proper functioning of the configuration and can impact system performance if not configured correctly. Failing to configure the prevalent system can lead to an IllegalStateException being thrown, causing disruptions in system operations. Therefore, the configuration is considered performance-sensitive as it directly affects system behavior and performance at the system level."
