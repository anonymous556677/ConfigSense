    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option '_transientMode' is performance-sensitive. The code context shows that the value of '_transientMode' directly affects the type of Journal returned by the 'journal' method. Depending on the value of '_transientMode', either a TransientJournal or a PersistentJournal is created, which can have significant performance variations. The creation of a TransientJournal may have different performance characteristics compared to a PersistentJournal, leading to notable performance differences at the system level. Therefore, the '_transientMode' configuration is considered performance-sensitive."
