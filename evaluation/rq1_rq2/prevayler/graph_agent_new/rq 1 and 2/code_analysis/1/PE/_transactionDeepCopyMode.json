{
    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option _transactionDeepCopyMode is classified as performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the _transactionDeepCopyMode configuration directly affects the behavior of the Prevayler system at the system level. The code snippet provided shows that the _transactionDeepCopyMode configuration is passed as a parameter when creating a Prevayler instance, which indicates that it plays a crucial role in the system's performance. Since Prevayler is a persistence framework, the choice of _transactionDeepCopyMode can significantly impact the execution time and memory consumption of the system, leading to notable performance variations."
