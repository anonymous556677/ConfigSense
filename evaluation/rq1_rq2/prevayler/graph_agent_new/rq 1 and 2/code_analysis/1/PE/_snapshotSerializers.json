    "Reason": "The configuration option '_snapshotSerializers' is not performance-sensitive based on the provided code context and developer's information. The code snippet related to the configuration does not contain any performance-intensive operations that would lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The configuration method 'journalSerializer' simply checks for a custom journal serializer and falls back to a default JavaSerializer if not set, which does not have a significant impact on performance."
