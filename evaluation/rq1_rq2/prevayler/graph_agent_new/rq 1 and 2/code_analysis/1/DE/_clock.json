If _remoteServerIpAddress is not null, the configuration is triggered whenever the publisher method is called. If _remoteServerIpAddress is null, the configuration is triggered whenever the publisher method is called and the clock() and journal() methods are invoked.",

Using a ClientPublisher may involve network communication with a remote server, while using a CentralPublisher may involve local processing with the system clock and journal."
