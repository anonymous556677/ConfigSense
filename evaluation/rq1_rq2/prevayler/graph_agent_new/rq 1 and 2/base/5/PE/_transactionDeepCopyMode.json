    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The _transactionDeepCopyMode configuration option is not performance-sensitive based on the provided code context and developer information. The configuration is simply passed as a parameter to the PrevaylerImpl constructor, and it does not involve any performance-related operations that significantly impact system performance at the system level. The configuration setting does not directly contribute to notable performance variations or have time-expensive or memory-expensive operations within its related code. Therefore, it is classified as not performance-sensitive."
