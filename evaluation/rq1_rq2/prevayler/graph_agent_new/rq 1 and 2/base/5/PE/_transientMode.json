    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option _transientMode is performance-sensitive. This is because it directly affects the type of journal (TransientJournal or PersistentJournal) that is used in the journal() method. Depending on the value of _transientMode, the system will create different types of journals, which can have a significant impact on system performance, durability, and resource usage. The choice between TransientJournal and PersistentJournal involves performance-related operations that are time-expensive and memory-expensive, leading to notable performance variations at the system level."
