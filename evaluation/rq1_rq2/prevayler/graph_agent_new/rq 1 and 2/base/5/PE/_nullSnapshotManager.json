    "Reason": "The _nullSnapshotManager configuration option is not performance-sensitive. The code snippet related to this configuration mainly focuses on checking the null condition and creating a new GenericSnapshotManager based on certain parameters. The impact of this configuration on system performance is minimal as it primarily deals with the creation of the snapshotManager instance. The configuration does not involve any time-expensive or memory-expensive operations that would lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
