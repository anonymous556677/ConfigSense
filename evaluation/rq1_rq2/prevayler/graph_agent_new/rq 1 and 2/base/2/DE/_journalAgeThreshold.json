    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The triggering frequency of the _journalAgeThreshold configuration depends on the usage of the journal method in the code. If the journal method is called frequently, then the _journalAgeThreshold configuration will be triggered accordingly.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the _journalAgeThreshold configuration on the system is related to the size of the journal. Setting a higher age threshold may result in larger journal files and potentially slower performance due to increased disk usage. Conversely, setting a lower age threshold may result in more frequent journal file rotations and potentially faster performance but with more disk I/O operations."
