    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The _journalDiskSync configuration option is used in the code to determine whether disk synchronization should be performed in the PersistentJournal constructor. If _journalDiskSync is true, disk synchronization will be enabled, otherwise it will be disabled.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The triggering frequency of the _journalDiskSync configuration depends on how often the journal() method is called in the system. If the method is called frequently, the _journalDiskSync configuration will also be triggered frequently.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the _journalDiskSync configuration option on the system can be significant. Enabling disk synchronization can ensure data durability but may also introduce performance overhead due to the disk write operations. Disabling disk synchronization may improve performance but at the cost of potential data loss in case of system failure."
