    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option _transientMode is classified as performance-sensitive. This is because the _transientMode directly determines whether a TransientJournal or a PersistentJournal is created in the journal() method. The choice between these two types of journals can have a significant impact on system performance and data durability. The creation of either a TransientJournal or a PersistentJournal involves performance-related operations that can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, making this configuration performance-sensitive."
