    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The _nullSnapshotManager configuration is performance-sensitive. The configuration directly impacts the system performance by determining whether a new GenericSnapshotManager is created or if the existing one is returned. This decision can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, especially considering the creation of a new GenericSnapshotManager involves time-expensive and memory-expensive operations. The code context shows that the configuration is triggered whenever the snapshotManager() method is called, indicating its significance in the system's performance. Therefore, based on the code analysis and developer's information, the configuration is classified as performance-sensitive."
