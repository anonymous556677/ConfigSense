    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The _transactionDeepCopyMode configuration is performance-sensitive. This is because the value set for _transactionDeepCopyMode directly affects how transactions are handled and copied within the Prevayler instance, impacting both memory usage and system performance. The configuration is passed as a parameter to the PrevaylerImpl constructor, indicating its importance in the system's operation. Additionally, the create() method, where the configuration is used, is a critical point for system performance as it initializes a Prevayler instance. Therefore, any changes in the _transactionDeepCopyMode configuration can lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
