    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The _journalDiskSync configuration option is used in the journal method to determine whether to enable disk synchronization for the persistent journal. If _transientMode is false, a PersistentJournal is created with the _journalDiskSync value passed as a parameter.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The triggering frequency of the _journalDiskSync configuration depends on the frequency of journal creation in the system. If journals are created frequently, the _journalDiskSync configuration will be triggered accordingly.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the _journalDiskSync configuration option on the system is related to the performance and durability of the journal. Enabling disk synchronization can ensure that data is safely written to disk before acknowledging the write operation, but it may also introduce latency depending on the disk write speed."
