    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option _transientMode is considered performance-sensitive. This is because it directly determines the type of journal used in the system, which can have a significant impact on system performance, durability, and storage requirements. The code context shows that if _transientMode is true, a TransientJournal is created, and if false, a PersistentJournal is created with specific parameters. This decision directly affects the behavior and performance of the system at a higher level, making it performance-sensitive."
