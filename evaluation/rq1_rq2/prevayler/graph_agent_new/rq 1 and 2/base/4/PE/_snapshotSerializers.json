    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The _snapshotSerializers configuration option is not performance-sensitive. The configuration is used to define the journalSerializer for the PrevaylerImpl instance, which is limited to the serialization and deserialization process of the journal files. It does not have a substantial impact on the overall system performance. The configuration is triggered once during the creation of the Prevayler instance and does not directly and substantially affect system performance at the system level."
