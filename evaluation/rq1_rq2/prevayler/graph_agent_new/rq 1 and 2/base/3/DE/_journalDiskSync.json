    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The _journalDiskSync configuration option is used in the journal() method to determine whether to enable disk synchronization for the PersistentJournal. If _transientMode is false, a PersistentJournal is created with the specified _journalDiskSync value.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The triggering frequency of the _journalDiskSync configuration depends on how often the journal() method is called in the system. If the method is called frequently, the configuration will be triggered more often.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the _journalDiskSync configuration option on the system is related to the performance and durability of the journaling process. Enabling disk synchronization can ensure that data is safely written to disk before acknowledging a transaction, but it may also introduce overhead and potentially slow down the system."
