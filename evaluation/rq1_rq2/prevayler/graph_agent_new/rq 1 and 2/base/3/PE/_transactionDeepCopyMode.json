    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The _transactionDeepCopyMode configuration option is performance-sensitive. This is because it directly affects the behavior of how transactions are handled and copied within the Prevayler implementation, which can have a significant impact on memory usage and performance at the system level. The code context shows that the _transactionDeepCopyMode parameter is passed to the PrevaylerImpl constructor, indicating that it plays a crucial role in the creation of a Prevayler instance. Since the configuration involves handling transactions, which are time-expensive and memory-expensive operations, any changes in the _transactionDeepCopyMode value can lead to notable performance variations in the system. Therefore, based on the code context and the developer's explanation, the _transactionDeepCopyMode configuration is considered performance-sensitive."
