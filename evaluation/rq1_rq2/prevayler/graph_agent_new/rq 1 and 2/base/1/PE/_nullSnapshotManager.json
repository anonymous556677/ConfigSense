    "Reason": "The _nullSnapshotManager configuration does not involve any time-expensive or memory-expensive operations within its related code. The configuration simply checks if the _nullSnapshotManager is null and returns it if not null, otherwise creates a new GenericSnapshotManager based on certain conditions. This operation does not directly and substantially affect system performance at the system level, and therefore, it is not considered performance-sensitive."
