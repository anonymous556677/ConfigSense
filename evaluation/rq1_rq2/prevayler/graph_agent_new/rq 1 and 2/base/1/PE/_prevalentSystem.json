    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The configuration '_prevalentSystem' is not performance-sensitive based on the provided code context and developer information. The configuration is used to initialize a GenericSnapshotManager object, and although it influences the behavior of the snapshot manager, it does not involve any time-expensive or memory-expensive operations that lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The prevalentSystem() method ensures that the prevalent system is configured before use, but this does not directly impact system performance in a significant way."
