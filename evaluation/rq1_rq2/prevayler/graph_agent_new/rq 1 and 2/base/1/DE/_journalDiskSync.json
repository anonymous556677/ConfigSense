    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The _journalDiskSync configuration is used in the code to determine whether to enable disk synchronization for the journal. If _transientMode is false, a PersistentJournal is created with the specified _journalDiskSync value.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The triggering frequency of the _journalDiskSync configuration depends on how often the journal method is called in the system. If the journal method is called frequently, the _journalDiskSync configuration will be triggered accordingly.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the _journalDiskSync configuration on the system is related to the performance and reliability of the journal. Enabling disk synchronization can ensure that data is safely written to disk, but it may also introduce overhead in terms of I/O operations."
