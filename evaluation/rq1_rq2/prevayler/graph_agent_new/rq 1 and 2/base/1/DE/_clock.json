If _remoteServerIpAddress is not null, the ClientPublisher will be instantiated. Otherwise, the CentralPublisher will be instantiated.

If a ClientPublisher is created, it will establish a connection to a remote server using the specified IP address and port. This may have network and resource usage implications. If a CentralPublisher is created, it will use the result of the clock() method, which could impact the timing or scheduling of publishing transactions."
