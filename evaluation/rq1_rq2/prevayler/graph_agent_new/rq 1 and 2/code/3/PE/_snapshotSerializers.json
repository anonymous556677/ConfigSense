    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The configuration option '_snapshotSerializers' does not directly involve any performance-related operations that are time-expensive or memory-expensive within its related code. The code context provided does not show any significant impact on system performance at the system level. Therefore, based on the code context analysis, the configuration is classified as not performance-sensitive."
