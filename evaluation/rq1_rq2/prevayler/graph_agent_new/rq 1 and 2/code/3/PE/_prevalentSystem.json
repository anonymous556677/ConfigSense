{
    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option '_prevalentSystem' is performance-sensitive. This is because the 'prevalentSystem()' method is called within the 'snapshotManager()' method, which is a performance-related operation that directly affects system performance. The 'prevalentSystem()' method is time-expensive and memory-expensive, leading to notable performance variations at the system level. Therefore, the configuration is considered performance-sensitive based on the code context and its impact on system performance."
