    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option '_transientMode' is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the '_transientMode' directly influences the choice of Journal implementation in the 'journal()' method. Depending on the value of '_transientMode', either a TransientJournal or a PersistentJournal is instantiated, which can have significant performance implications. The creation of a PersistentJournal involves operations that are time-expensive and memory-expensive, such as creating a PrevaylerDirectory and setting various thresholds and parameters. Therefore, the '_transientMode' configuration can lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
