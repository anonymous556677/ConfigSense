    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option '_transientMode' is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the '_transientMode' directly affects the execution path of the 'journal()' method. When '_transientMode' is true, it creates a new 'TransientJournal' object, which is a time-expensive operation. This can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Therefore, the configuration '_transientMode' is considered performance-sensitive."
