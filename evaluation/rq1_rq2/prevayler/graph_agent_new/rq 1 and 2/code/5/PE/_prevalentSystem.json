{
    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option '_prevalentSystem' is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the 'prevalentSystem()' method is called within the 'snapshotManager()' method, which is a performance-related operation. Depending on the implementation of 'prevalentSystem()', it could potentially involve time-expensive or memory-expensive operations that directly impact system performance at the system level. Therefore, the configuration '_prevalentSystem' can lead to notable performance variations and should be considered performance-sensitive."
