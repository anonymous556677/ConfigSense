{
    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option '_transactionDeepCopyMode' is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the '_transactionDeepCopyMode' directly affects the execution time and memory consumption at the system level. In the provided code context, the '_transactionDeepCopyMode' is passed as a parameter when creating a Prevayler instance, which indicates that it has a direct impact on the behavior of the Prevayler system. Depending on the value of '_transactionDeepCopyMode', the system may need to perform deep copy operations on transactions, which can significantly affect performance by increasing memory usage and execution time. Therefore, any changes to '_transactionDeepCopyMode' can lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
