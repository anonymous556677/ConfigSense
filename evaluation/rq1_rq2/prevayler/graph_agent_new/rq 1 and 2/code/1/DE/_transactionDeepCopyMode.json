    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The _transactionDeepCopyMode configuration option is used in the create() method to initialize a PrevaylerImpl object. It is passed as a parameter to the PrevaylerImpl constructor.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The _transactionDeepCopyMode configuration is triggered whenever a new PrevaylerImpl object is created, which typically happens when the system is started or restarted.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The _transactionDeepCopyMode configuration option impacts the system's memory usage and performance. If set to true, it will create deep copies of transaction objects, which can increase memory usage but provide better data integrity. If set to false, it will use shallow copies, which may be more memory efficient but could lead to potential data corruption if the original objects are modified."
