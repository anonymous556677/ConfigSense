    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option '_prevalentSystem' is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the 'prevalentSystem()' method is called within the 'snapshotManager()' method, and it directly affects the creation of the 'GenericSnapshotManager' instance. The 'prevalentSystem()' method involves some performance-related operations that are time-expensive, as it is used to initialize and configure the 'GenericSnapshotManager' with the prevalent system. This leads to notable performance variations at the system level, making the configuration performance-sensitive."
