    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option _prevalentSystem is performance-sensitive. This is because the prevalentSystem() method is called within the snapshotManager() method, which is a performance-related operation contributing to execution time and memory consumption. The prevalentSystem() method directly affects system performance at the system level by initializing the GenericSnapshotManager with the prevalent system, which can lead to notable performance variations. Therefore, the configuration is considered performance-sensitive."
