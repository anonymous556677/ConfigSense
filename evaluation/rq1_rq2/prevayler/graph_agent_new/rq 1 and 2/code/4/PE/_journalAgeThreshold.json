    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option _journalAgeThreshold is performance-sensitive. The configuration directly affects the system performance at the system level by setting the age threshold for the journal. This threshold impacts the performance of the PersistentJournal by determining when data is flushed to disk. The code snippet shows that the _journalAgeThreshold is used in the construction of the PersistentJournal, which is a time-expensive operation. Therefore, changes in _journalAgeThreshold can lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
