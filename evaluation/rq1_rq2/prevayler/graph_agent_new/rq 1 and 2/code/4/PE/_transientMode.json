    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option '_transientMode' is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the '_transientMode' directly affects the performance of the system at the system level. When '_transientMode' is true, it returns a new TransientJournal which is a time-expensive operation. This operation can lead to notable performance variations in the system. Therefore, the configuration '_transientMode' is considered performance-sensitive."
