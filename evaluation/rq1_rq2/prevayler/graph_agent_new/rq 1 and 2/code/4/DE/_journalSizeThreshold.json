    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The triggering frequency of the _journalSizeThreshold configuration depends on when the journal() method is called in the system. If the journal() method is called frequently or in critical parts of the system, then the _journalSizeThreshold configuration will be triggered accordingly.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the _journalSizeThreshold configuration option on the system is significant as it determines the size threshold for the journal. This can affect the performance and storage requirements of the system, especially in scenarios where a large amount of data needs to be journaled."
