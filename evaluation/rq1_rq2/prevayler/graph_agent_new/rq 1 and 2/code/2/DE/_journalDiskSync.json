    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The _journalDiskSync configuration is used in the journal() method to determine whether disk syncing should be enabled for the PersistentJournal. If _journalDiskSync is true, disk syncing is enabled, otherwise it is not.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The triggering frequency of the _journalDiskSync configuration depends on the value set for it. If _journalDiskSync is set to true, disk syncing will be triggered whenever a write operation is performed on the journal. If _journalDiskSync is false, disk syncing will not be triggered.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the _journalDiskSync configuration option on the system is significant. Enabling disk syncing can ensure data durability by synchronizing data to disk after each write operation, but it can also impact performance due to the overhead of disk I/O operations. Disabling disk syncing may improve performance but at the risk of potential data loss in case of system failure."
