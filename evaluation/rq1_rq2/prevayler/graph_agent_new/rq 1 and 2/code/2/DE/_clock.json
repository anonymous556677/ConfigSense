If _remoteServerIpAddress is null, a CentralPublisher is returned with the result of the clock() method and journal().",

If _remoteServerIpAddress is frequently changing or being updated, the configuration may be triggered more often.

If a ClientPublisher is returned, it may have different network behavior and communication with the server compared to a CentralPublisher. This could impact the performance and behavior of the system depending on the specific implementation details of the publishers."
