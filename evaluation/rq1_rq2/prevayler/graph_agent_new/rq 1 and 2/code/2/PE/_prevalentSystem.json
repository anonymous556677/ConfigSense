    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option _prevalentSystem is performance-sensitive. This is because the prevalentSystem() method is called within the snapshotManager() method, and the prevalentSystem() method is likely to involve performance-related operations that are time-extensive or memory-extensive. The configuration directly affects the creation of the GenericSnapshotManager, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Therefore, the configuration is considered performance-sensitive."
