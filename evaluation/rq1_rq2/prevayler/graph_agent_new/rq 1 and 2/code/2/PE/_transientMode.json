    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option '_transientMode' is performance-sensitive. The code context shows that depending on the value of '_transientMode', different types of Journals are instantiated, which can have a significant impact on system performance. Creating a TransientJournal is likely to be less time and memory expensive compared to creating a PersistentJournal with various thresholds and disk sync options. This configuration directly affects the performance of the system by choosing between different types of Journals, leading to notable performance variations at the system level."
