    "Reason": "The configuration option '_clock' is not performance-sensitive. The code snippet provided does not contain any performance-related operations that are time-extensive or memory-extensive. The configuration simply calls the 'clock()' and 'journal()' methods, which are likely to be lightweight operations and do not lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
