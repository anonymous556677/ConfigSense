    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The triggering frequency of the _journalDiskSync configuration depends on how often the journal is accessed and written to. If the journal is frequently updated, the disk synchronization will be triggered more often.",

Enabling disk synchronization can ensure that data is safely written to disk, but it may also introduce overhead and potentially impact system performance."
