    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The triggering frequency of the _journalAgeThreshold configuration depends on the usage of the journal. It will be triggered whenever a new journal is created or when the age threshold condition is met.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the _journalAgeThreshold configuration option on the system is that it determines how long journal entries are kept before they are considered old and potentially removed. Setting a lower age threshold may result in more frequent journal cleanups and potentially more disk space usage."
