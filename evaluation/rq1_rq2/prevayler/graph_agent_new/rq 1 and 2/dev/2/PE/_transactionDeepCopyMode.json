    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The _transactionDeepCopyMode configuration option is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the behavior of the Prevayler instance, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Depending on the value set for _transactionDeepCopyMode, it can affect memory usage and performance of the system. Since the configuration is passed as a parameter to the PrevaylerImpl constructor, it is directly related to performance-related operations within the code. Therefore, any changes in _transactionDeepCopyMode can have a significant impact on system performance."
