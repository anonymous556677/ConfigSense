    "Reason": "The configuration option _clock is not performance-sensitive based on the provided information. The developer's understanding indicates that the impact of _clock on system performance is minimal, as it mainly determines which type of publisher to use based on the value of _remoteServerIpAddress. The configuration does not involve any time-expensive or memory-expensive operations that would lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Therefore, it does not directly and substantially affect system performance in a significant way."
