    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option _monitor is performance-sensitive. The creation of either a TransientJournal or a PersistentJournal based on the value of _transientMode directly impacts system performance. The choice between the two journal types affects both execution time and memory consumption, with potential notable performance variations at the system level. Additionally, the triggering frequency of the configuration based on _transientMode changes can lead to frequent performance impacts, making it a performance-sensitive configuration."
