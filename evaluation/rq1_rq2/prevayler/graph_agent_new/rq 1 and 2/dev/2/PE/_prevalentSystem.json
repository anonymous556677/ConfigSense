    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The _prevalentSystem configuration option is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the behavior and performance of the system by determining the prevalent system used by the GenericSnapshotManager. This configuration option is passed as a parameter to the GenericSnapshotManager constructor, and depending on the conditions in the code, it can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The triggering frequency of the _prevalentSystem configuration option also indicates that it is involved in performance-related operations within its related code, making it time-expensive and memory-expensive."
