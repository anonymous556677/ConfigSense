    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option _prevalentSystem is performance-sensitive. The creation of a GenericSnapshotManager object with custom serializers from _snapshotSerializers list can have a notable impact on system performance. Depending on the type of serializers used, it can affect serialization and deserialization performance, leading to significant performance variations at the system level. The configuration-related code involves time-expensive operations like creating PrevaylerDirectory object using prevalenceDirectory() and initializing GenericSnapshotManager with custom serializers, which can contribute to performance variations."
