    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The _transientMode configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly determines whether a TransientJournal or a PersistentJournal is used in the journal() method. This decision can have a significant impact on performance, durability, and resource usage at the system level. The creation of a TransientJournal or PersistentJournal involves performance-related operations that can be time-expensive and memory-expensive, leading to notable performance variations. Therefore, the configuration is considered performance-sensitive based on its direct and substantial effect on system performance."
