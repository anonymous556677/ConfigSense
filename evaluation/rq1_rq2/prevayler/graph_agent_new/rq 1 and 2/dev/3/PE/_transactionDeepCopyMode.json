    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The _transactionDeepCopyMode configuration option is performance-sensitive because it directly affects how transactions are handled and copied within the Prevayler instance, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Depending on the value of _transactionDeepCopyMode, the system may exhibit different behavior and performance characteristics, making it a critical configuration for system performance. The configuration involves performance-related operations that are time-expensive and memory-expensive within its related code, which can significantly impact system performance."
