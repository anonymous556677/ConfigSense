    "Reason": "The _clock configuration option is not performance-sensitive based on the provided information. The developer's explanation indicates that the configuration is used to determine the type of publisher returned based on the presence of _remoteServerIpAddress. While the triggering frequency of the configuration may vary based on certain conditions, the impact on system performance is not substantial. The configuration does not involve any time-expensive or memory-expensive operations within its related code that would lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
