    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The _snapshotSerializers configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly affects the performance and efficiency of the system at the system level. The configuration is triggered once during the creation of the Prevayler instance in the create() method, and it determines how the Prevayler handles snapshot serialization. This can have a notable impact on performance as snapshot serialization is a time-expensive operation that can lead to significant performance variations in the system."
