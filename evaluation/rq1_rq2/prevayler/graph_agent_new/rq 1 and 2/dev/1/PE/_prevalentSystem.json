    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The configuration option _prevalentSystem is used to set up the snapshot manager with necessary settings during initialization. While it impacts the behavior of the snapshot manager, it does not involve any performance-sensitive operations that significantly affect system performance at the system level. The configuration does not lead to notable performance variations or contribute to time-expensive or memory-expensive operations within its related code. Therefore, it is classified as not performance-sensitive."
