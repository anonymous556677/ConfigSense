    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The _transactionDeepCopyMode configuration option is performance-sensitive because it directly affects the memory usage and performance of the system at the system level. The configuration is passed as a parameter to the PrevaylerImpl constructor, indicating its importance in the creation of a Prevayler instance. Depending on the value set for this configuration, it can impact how transactions are handled and copied within the Prevayler implementation, leading to notable performance variations. Therefore, the configuration is considered performance-sensitive due to its direct and substantial impact on system performance."
