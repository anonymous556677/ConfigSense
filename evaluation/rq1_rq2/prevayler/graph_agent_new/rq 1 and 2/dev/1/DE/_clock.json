The configuration might have a variable named _clock which can be set to a specific Clock object, and if it is not set, the method will default to using a MachineClock object. This method is crucial for time-related operations in the application."

If a ClientPublisher is returned, it may have network communication overhead and dependencies on the specified IP address and port. If a CentralPublisher is returned, it may have dependencies on the current clock and journal implementation."
