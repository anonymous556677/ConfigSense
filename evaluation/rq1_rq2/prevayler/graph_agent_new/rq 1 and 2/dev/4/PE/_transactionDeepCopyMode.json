    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The _transactionDeepCopyMode configuration option is performance-sensitive because it directly affects system performance at the system level. The configuration is used in the create() method to instantiate a Prevayler instance, and depending on the value of _transactionDeepCopyMode, there can be notable performance variations in terms of memory usage and transaction handling within the Prevayler implementation. This configuration involves performance-related operations that are time-expensive and memory-expensive, leading to significant performance impacts at the system level."
