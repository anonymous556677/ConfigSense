    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option _prevalentSystem is performance-sensitive. This is because it directly affects the behavior of the GenericSnapshotManager, which can have a significant impact on the overall system performance and behavior. The configuration is triggered whenever a new GenericSnapshotManager is created, indicating that it plays a crucial role in the system. Additionally, the developer mentioned that the size impact of this configuration is significant, further emphasizing its importance in the system. Therefore, any performance-related operations within the code related to _prevalentSystem can lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
