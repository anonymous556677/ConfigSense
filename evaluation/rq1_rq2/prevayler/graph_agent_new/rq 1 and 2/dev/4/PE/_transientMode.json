    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The _transientMode configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly determines the type of journal used in the journal() method, which can have a significant impact on system performance. Depending on the value of _transientMode, either a TransientJournal or a PersistentJournal is created, leading to different performance characteristics. The use of a TransientJournal may result in faster performance but potential data loss, while a PersistentJournal ensures data persistence but may impact performance. Since the choice between these two options can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, the _transientMode configuration is considered performance-sensitive."
