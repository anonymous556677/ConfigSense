    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option _transientMode is performance-sensitive. The decision to use either a TransientJournal or a PersistentJournal directly impacts system performance at the system level. Depending on the value assigned to _transientMode, the system may experience notable performance variations due to the choice of journal type. The configuration-related code context, specifically the journal() method, contains performance-related operations that are time-expensive and memory-expensive, leading to significant performance impacts. Therefore, the _transientMode configuration is considered performance-sensitive."
