    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The _transactionDeepCopyMode configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly affects the memory usage and performance of the system at the system level. The configuration is used as a parameter when creating a Prevayler instance, and depending on the value set for _transactionDeepCopyMode, it can lead to notable performance variations. Since transactions are handled and copied within the Prevayler instance, the configuration can involve time-expensive and memory-expensive operations, making it performance-sensitive."
