    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The configuration option '_prevalentSystem' is not performance-sensitive based on the provided information. The developer's explanation indicates that this configuration is responsible for providing the prevalent system instance to the snapshot manager, which is essential for managing snapshots and serialization. This configuration does not involve any time-extensive or memory-extensive operations that would lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Therefore, it is considered to have a trivial performance impact and is not classified as performance-sensitive."
