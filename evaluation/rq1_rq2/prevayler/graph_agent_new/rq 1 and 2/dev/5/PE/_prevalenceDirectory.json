    "Reason": "The configuration option _prevalenceDirectory does not directly involve any performance-related operations that are time-expensive or memory-expensive within its related code. It simply determines the directory where Prevayler will store its files, which does not lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Therefore, it is considered not performance-sensitive."
