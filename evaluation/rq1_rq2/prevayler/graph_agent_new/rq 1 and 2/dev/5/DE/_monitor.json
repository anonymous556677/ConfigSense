The method provides a way to retrieve an existing Monitor object or create a new one if it doesn't exist, which can be crucial for configuring and managing the application's behavior."

If a TransientJournal object is created, it may have lower impact on system resources compared to a PersistentJournal object which may have impact on disk space and performance due to the specified parameters like journal size threshold, age threshold, and disk sync option."
