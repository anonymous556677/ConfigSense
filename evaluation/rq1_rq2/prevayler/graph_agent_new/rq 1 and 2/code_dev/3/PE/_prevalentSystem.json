    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option '_prevalentSystem' is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the creation of the GenericSnapshotManager object, which involves time-expensive operations such as creating a PrevaylerDirectory object and checking the snapshotSerializers list. Depending on the parameters passed to the method, it can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The code context shows that the configuration is crucial for determining the behavior and functionality of the snapshot manager, making it performance-sensitive."
