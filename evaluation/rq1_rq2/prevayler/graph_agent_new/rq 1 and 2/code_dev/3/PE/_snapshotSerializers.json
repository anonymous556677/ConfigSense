    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The _snapshotSerializers configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the performance and storage size of the system. The code context shows that it is used to define the journalSerializer, which is crucial for the Prevayler implementation. The configuration involves setting the serializer for journal files, which can have a significant impact on the system's performance and memory consumption. Therefore, the configuration is considered performance-sensitive as it directly affects system performance at the system level."
