    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The _transactionDeepCopyMode configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly affects the behavior of the PrevaylerImpl instance in terms of memory usage and performance. Depending on the value of _transactionDeepCopyMode, the system may experience notable performance variations at the system level. The configuration is passed as a parameter to the PrevaylerImpl constructor, indicating that it plays a crucial role in the creation of Prevayler instances, which are essential components of the system. Therefore, any changes in the _transactionDeepCopyMode configuration can have a significant impact on the system's performance, making it performance-sensitive."
