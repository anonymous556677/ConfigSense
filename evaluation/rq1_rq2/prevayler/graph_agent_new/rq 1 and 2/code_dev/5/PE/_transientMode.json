    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option _transientMode is performance-sensitive. The code context shows that depending on the value of _transientMode, either a TransientJournal or a PersistentJournal is created in the journal() method. This decision directly impacts the system's performance and resource usage, as TransientJournal is lightweight but not persistent, while PersistentJournal is more resource-intensive but provides durability. Therefore, the configuration _transientMode leads to notable performance variations at the system level, making it performance-sensitive."
