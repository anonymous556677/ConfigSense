    "Reason": "The _transactionDeepCopyMode configuration option is performance-sensitive because it directly affects the behavior of the Prevayler instance created in the create() method. Depending on the value set for _transactionDeepCopyMode, it can impact memory usage and performance of the system by influencing how transaction objects are copied. This can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, making it a performance-sensitive configuration."
