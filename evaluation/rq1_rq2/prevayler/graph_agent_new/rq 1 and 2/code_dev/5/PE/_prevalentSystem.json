    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option '_prevalentSystem' is performance-sensitive. This is because it directly affects the initialization and operation of the GenericSnapshotManager, which is a critical component in managing system snapshots. The configuration is passed as a parameter to the GenericSnapshotManager constructor, indicating its importance in the performance of the snapshot manager. Any variations or inefficiencies in the initialization process of the GenericSnapshotManager due to the '_prevalentSystem' configuration can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, making it performance-sensitive."
