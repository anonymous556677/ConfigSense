    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The _journalDiskSync configuration option is used in the journal() method to determine whether to use disk synchronization for the journal. If _transientMode is false, a PersistentJournal object is created with the specified _journalDiskSync value.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The triggering frequency of the _journalDiskSync configuration option depends on how often the journal() method is called in the system. If the method is called frequently, the _journalDiskSync configuration option will be triggered accordingly.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the _journalDiskSync configuration option on the system is related to the performance and reliability of the journaling process. Enabling disk synchronization can ensure that data is safely written to disk, but it may also introduce overhead and potentially impact system performance."
