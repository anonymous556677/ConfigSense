If _remoteServerIpAddress is not null, a ClientPublisher is created with the specified server IP address and port. Otherwise, a CentralPublisher is created with the current clock and journal.",

    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the _clock configuration option on the system is related to the type of publisher instantiated. If a ClientPublisher is created, it may involve network communication and connection establishment with the remote server. On the other hand, if a CentralPublisher is created, it may involve local clock and journal operations."
