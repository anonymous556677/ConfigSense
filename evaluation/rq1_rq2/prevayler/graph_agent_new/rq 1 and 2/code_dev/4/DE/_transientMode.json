    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The triggering frequency of the _transientMode configuration depends on the value assigned to it and how often the journal() method is called in the system. If _transientMode is frequently set to true or false, the configuration will be triggered accordingly.",

Using a TransientJournal may provide better performance but less durability compared to a PersistentJournal."
