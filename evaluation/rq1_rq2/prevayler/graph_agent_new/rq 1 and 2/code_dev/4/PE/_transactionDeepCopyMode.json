    "Reason": "The _transactionDeepCopyMode configuration is performance-sensitive. This is because it directly affects the behavior of the Prevayler instance created in the create() method, which can have a significant impact on system performance. Depending on the value set for _transactionDeepCopyMode, it can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, making it a performance-sensitive configuration."
