    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option _prevalentSystem is performance-sensitive. This is because it directly affects the initialization of the GenericSnapshotManager object, which is a critical component for managing system snapshots. The code snippet shows that the _prevalentSystem configuration is passed as a parameter to the GenericSnapshotManager constructor, indicating that it plays a significant role in the performance of the snapshot management functionality. Any changes or misconfigurations in this option can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, making it a performance-sensitive configuration."
