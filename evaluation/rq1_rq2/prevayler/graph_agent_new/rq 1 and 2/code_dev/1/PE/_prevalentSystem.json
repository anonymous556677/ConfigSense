    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option '_prevalentSystem' is performance-sensitive. This is because it directly affects the initialization of the GenericSnapshotManager object, which is a critical component for managing snapshots and serialization in the system. The code snippet shows that the prevalentSystem() method is called within the GenericSnapshotManager constructor, indicating that it is involved in performance-related operations that can have a notable impact on system performance. Therefore, the configuration is considered performance-sensitive based on its direct and substantial effect on system performance at the system level."
