    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option _transientMode is performance-sensitive. This is because it directly determines whether a TransientJournal or a PersistentJournal is used in the journal() method, which can have a significant impact on system performance and storage requirements. The creation of different types of journals based on this configuration can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, making it a performance-sensitive configuration."
