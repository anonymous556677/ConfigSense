    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The _journalSizeThreshold configuration is considered performance-sensitive because it directly and substantially affects system performance at the system level. The configuration is used to set the size threshold for the PersistentJournal, which can impact system performance and storage usage by determining the size of journal files. This configuration involves performance-related operations within its related code that are memory-expensive and can lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
