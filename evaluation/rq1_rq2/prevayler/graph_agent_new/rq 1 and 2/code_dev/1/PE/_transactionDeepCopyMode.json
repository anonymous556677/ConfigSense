    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The _transactionDeepCopyMode configuration is not performance-sensitive based on the provided code context and developer's information. The configuration is simply passed as a parameter to the PrevaylerImpl constructor when creating a Prevayler instance. There are no performance-related operations within the code snippet that suggest significant performance variations at the system level. The impact of _transactionDeepCopyMode seems to be related to how transactions are copied and managed, but it does not directly and substantially affect system performance in a notable way."
