Otherwise, it returns a CentralPublisher with the result of the clock() method and the journal().",

If _remoteServerIpAddress is not null, the ClientPublisher will be triggered. Otherwise, the CentralPublisher will be triggered. The frequency of triggering will depend on the flow of the program and the values of the variables involved.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the _clock configuration option on the system is that it determines which type of TransactionPublisher is used. This can impact the behavior and performance of the system depending on the type of publisher returned. For example, using a ClientPublisher may involve network communication with a remote server, while using a CentralPublisher may involve local operations. The choice of publisher can affect system latency, reliability, and resource usage."
