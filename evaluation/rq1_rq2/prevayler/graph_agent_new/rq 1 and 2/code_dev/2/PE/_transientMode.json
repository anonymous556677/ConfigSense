    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option _transientMode is performance-sensitive. This is because it directly impacts the type of journal created, which can have a significant effect on system performance and storage requirements. The code context shows that depending on the value of _transientMode, either a TransientJournal or a PersistentJournal with specific parameters is created. Creating different types of journals can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, making this configuration performance-sensitive."
