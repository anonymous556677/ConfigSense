    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The _transientMode configuration option in the prevayler software project is performance-sensitive because changing its value can significantly impact system performance. When set to true, it can cause increased memory consumption and slower execution times due to the need to store more data in memory temporarily. This can lead to performance degradation, especially in systems with limited resources or high transaction volumes."
