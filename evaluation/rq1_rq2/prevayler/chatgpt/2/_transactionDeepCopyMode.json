    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The _transactionDeepCopyMode configuration option in the prevayler software project is performance-sensitive because changing its value can significantly impact system performance. This configuration determines whether deep copying is used during transaction processing, which can affect memory consumption and execution time. If deep copying is enabled, it may increase memory usage and slow down transaction processing, while disabling it can reduce memory overhead and improve performance. Therefore, changes in this configuration can lead to notable variations in system performance."
