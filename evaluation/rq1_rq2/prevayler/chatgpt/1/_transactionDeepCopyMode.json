    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The _transactionDeepCopyMode configuration option in the prevayler software project is performance-sensitive because changing its value can significantly impact system performance. This configuration determines how transactions are handled, and a change in this mode can lead to notable variations in execution time and memory consumption. For example, enabling deep copy mode may increase memory usage and slow down transaction processing, while disabling it may improve performance but introduce potential data consistency issues."
