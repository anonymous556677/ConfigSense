    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The _transactionDeepCopyMode configuration option in the prevayler software project is performance-sensitive because changing its value significantly affects system performance. When set to true, it causes the system to create deep copies of transaction objects, increasing memory consumption and potentially impacting execution time. This can lead to notable variations in system performance, making it a critical configuration to consider for performance optimization."
