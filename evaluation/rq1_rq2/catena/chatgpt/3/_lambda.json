    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The _lambda configuration option in the catena software project is performance-sensitive because changing its value significantly affects the system's execution time. A higher value of _lambda can lead to increased resource consumption and longer processing times, while a lower value can result in faster execution but potentially at the cost of higher resource utilization. Therefore, the value of _lambda has a notable impact on system performance, making it a performance-sensitive configuration."
