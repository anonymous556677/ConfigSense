    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option _gHigh is performance-sensitive because changing its value significantly affects system performance. This configuration likely controls a high-level parameter that has a direct impact on the execution time or memory consumption of the system. Therefore, any variation in its value can lead to notable changes in overall performance."
