    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option _gHigh is performance-sensitive because its value directly impacts the level of granularity in the system, affecting the amount of data processed and the computational resources required. A higher value for _gHigh can lead to increased execution time and memory consumption due to the increased complexity of operations and data handling."
