    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option _d is performance-sensitive because changing its value significantly impacts system performance. For example, increasing the value of _d may lead to higher memory consumption and longer execution times, while decreasing it may result in improved performance. Therefore, any changes to _d can cause notable variations in system performance, making it a performance-sensitive configuration."
