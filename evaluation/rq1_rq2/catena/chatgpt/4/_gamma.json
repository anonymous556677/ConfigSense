    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The _gamma configuration option in the catena software project is performance-sensitive because changing its value significantly affects system performance. This configuration likely controls a crucial parameter that directly impacts the execution time or memory consumption of the system. Therefore, any variations in its value can lead to notable changes in overall performance."
