    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The _lambda configuration option in the catena software project is performance-sensitive because changing its value significantly impacts the system's execution time. A higher value of _lambda can lead to increased computational overhead and longer processing times, while a lower value can result in faster execution but potentially higher memory consumption. Therefore, any change in the _lambda configuration can cause notable variations in system performance, making it a performance-sensitive parameter."
