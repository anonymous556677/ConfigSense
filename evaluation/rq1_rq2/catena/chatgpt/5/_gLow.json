    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option _gLow is performance-sensitive because changing its value significantly affects system performance. When _gLow is set to a low value, it may lead to increased execution time and memory consumption due to the system having to process more data or perform more computations. Conversely, setting _gLow to a high value may result in improved performance by reducing the workload on the system. Therefore, the value of _gLow has a notable impact on system performance, making it a performance-sensitive configuration."
