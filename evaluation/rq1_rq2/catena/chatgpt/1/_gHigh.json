    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option _gHigh is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the level of granularity in data processing within the catena software. A higher value for _gHigh may lead to increased memory consumption and longer execution times due to the increased complexity of data processing operations. Therefore, changes in the value of _gHigh can significantly affect system performance."
