    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The _lambda configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly affects the execution time and memory consumption of the system. The code snippets related to the _lambda configuration, such as the flap function and key derivation operations, are time-expensive and memory-expensive, leading to notable performance variations at the system level. The configuration is crucial for generating hashes, key derivation, and server relief client functions, impacting the overall performance of the system."
