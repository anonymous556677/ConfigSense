    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The _hPrime configuration is performance-sensitive. This is because the _hPrime configuration is directly involved in the flap method, which performs hashing operations that can be time-expensive and memory-expensive. The flap method is called during the execution of certain operations in the Catena class, and the size of the output generated by the hashing operations is determined by _hPrime. Any changes or optimizations to the _hPrime configuration can have a notable impact on the performance of the system at the system level."
