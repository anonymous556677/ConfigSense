    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The _gHigh configuration option is performance-sensitive because it directly affects the number of iterations in a loop within the code. This loop is crucial for generating the output and can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The value of _gHigh determines the maximum value for the variable 'g' in the loop, impacting the execution time and memory consumption of the system. Therefore, any changes to _gHigh can have a significant performance impact on the system."
