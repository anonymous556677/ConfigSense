    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option _gamma is considered performance-sensitive. The code context shows that it involves salt dependent update with random access, which can be time-expensive and memory-expensive operations. Depending on the size of the input parameters and the complexity of the gamma method, it can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Therefore, the configuration _gamma directly and substantially affects system performance, making it performance-sensitive."
