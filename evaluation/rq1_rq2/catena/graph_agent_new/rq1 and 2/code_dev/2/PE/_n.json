    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option _n is performance-sensitive. The code snippet shows that the value of _n directly impacts the padding of the byte array x, which affects the size of the output hash. This size impact can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, especially when the padding operation is repeated in a loop until the upper limit gHigh is reached. Therefore, the configuration _n is considered performance-sensitive as it directly and substantially affects system performance by causing significant performance variations."
