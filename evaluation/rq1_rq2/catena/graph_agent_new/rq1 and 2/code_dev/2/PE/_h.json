{
    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option _h is performance-sensitive because it directly affects the hash function used in critical operations such as key derivation, password hashing, and server-client interactions. Any changes to _h can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, as it impacts the execution time and memory consumption of these operations. The code context shows that _h is extensively used in various functions, indicating its importance in system performance. Therefore, based on the code analysis and its impact on system-level performance, _h is classified as performance-sensitive."
