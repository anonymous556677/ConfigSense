    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option _vId is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the size of the output key generated in the keyDerivation method and the final hash value in the catena and serverReliefClient methods. The value of _vId is used as a parameter in performance-related operations such as computing tweak values, which significantly affect the execution time and memory consumption of the system. The frequency of triggering the _vId configuration also indicates its importance in the system, making it a performance-sensitive configuration."
