    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option _n is performance-sensitive because it directly affects the size of the byte array x in multiple functions such as catena, keyDerivation, and serverReliefClient. If the length of x is less than _n, padding with zero bytes is performed, which increases memory consumption and processing time. This can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, especially in functions where x is processed iteratively. Therefore, the configuration _n has a significant impact on system performance and is considered performance-sensitive."
