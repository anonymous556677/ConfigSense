    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The _vId configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly influences the computation of tweak values in critical methods like catena, keyDerivation, and serverReliefClient. The _vId value impacts the domain parameter, output key size limit, and other computations, leading to notable performance variations at the system level. The frequency of _vId usage across multiple operations indicates its importance in system performance, making it a performance-sensitive configuration."
