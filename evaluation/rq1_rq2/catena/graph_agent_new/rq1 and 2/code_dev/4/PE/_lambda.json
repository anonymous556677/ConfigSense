    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The _lambda configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly affects the execution time and memory consumption of the system. The _lambda parameter is used in the compTweak function, which is a critical part of the hashing process in the Catena function. Changes in the _lambda value can lead to notable performance variations in the system due to the time-expensive and memory-expensive operations involved in the hashing algorithm. Therefore, any modifications to the _lambda configuration can have a significant impact on the overall performance of the system."
