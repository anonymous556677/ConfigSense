    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option _h is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the _h configuration directly affects the performance of the system at the system level. The _h configuration is used in critical functions such as password hashing, key derivation, and server relief operations, which are time-expensive and memory-expensive operations. The hash function _h is crucial for the security and integrity of the system, and any variations in its performance can have a notable impact on the overall system performance."
