    "Reason": "The configuration option _f is not performance-sensitive based on the provided code context and developer's information. The code snippet shows that the _f configuration is simply calling the graph method of the f function with parameters g, x, and lambda. There are no performance-intensive operations or significant performance variations at the system level caused by this configuration. It is a straightforward function call that does not have a notable impact on system performance."
