    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The configuration option _gamma is not performance-sensitive based on the provided code context and developer information. The method gamma performs a salt dependent update with random access on the input parameters and returns a hash array. This operation does not involve any time-expensive or memory-expensive operations that would lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Additionally, the impact of _gamma on the hash array returned by gamma is limited to data alteration within the array, which does not have a significant performance impact."
