    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The _gHigh configuration option is performance-sensitive because it directly affects the number of iterations in the loop within the code context. The value of _gHigh determines the upper limit for the loop iterations, which can have a significant impact on the execution time and memory consumption of the system. A higher value of _gHigh can lead to more iterations, potentially causing notable performance variations at the system level. Therefore, based on the code context and the developer's explanation, the _gHigh configuration is considered performance-sensitive."
