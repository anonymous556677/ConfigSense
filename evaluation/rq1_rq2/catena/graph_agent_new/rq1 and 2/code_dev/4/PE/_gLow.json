    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The _gLow configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly affects the behavior of the system by determining the starting point for a loop that iterates over a range of values. This loop is used in multiple functions that contribute significantly to the execution time and memory consumption of the system. The value of _gLow influences the flow of the program and can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, making it a performance-sensitive configuration."
