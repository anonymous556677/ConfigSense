    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The configuration _phi does not appear to be performance-sensitive based on the provided code context and developer information. The method simply delegates the call to the phi method of the get_phi() object without any additional logic or operations that could significantly impact system performance. Since the method itself does not contain any time-expensive or memory-expensive operations, it is unlikely to cause notable performance variations at the system level."
