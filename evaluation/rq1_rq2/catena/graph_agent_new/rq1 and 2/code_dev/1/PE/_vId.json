    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The _vId configuration is performance-sensitive because it is directly involved in the compTweak function, which is called in critical functions like catena, keyDerivation, and serverReliefClient. The compTweak function is essential for generating hashes and keys, impacting system performance significantly. The _vId configuration affects the size of the output, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Therefore, based on its usage and impact on critical operations, the _vId configuration is classified as performance-sensitive."
