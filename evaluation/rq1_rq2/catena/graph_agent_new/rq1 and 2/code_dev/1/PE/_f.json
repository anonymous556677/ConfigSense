    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The configuration _f in the provided code context only calls the graph method of the f function with parameters g, x, and lambda. There are no performance-intensive operations within the configuration-related code that directly and substantially affect system performance at the system level. The developer's information also indicates that the impact of _f on the system depends on how the f function is implemented and utilized, suggesting that _f itself is not performance-sensitive."
