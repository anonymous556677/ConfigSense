    "Reason": "The _d configuration does not directly involve any performance-sensitive operations that significantly impact system performance at the system level. The code snippet provided focuses on generating a hash value based on the input parameters and does not contain any time-expensive or memory-expensive operations that would lead to notable performance variations. While the configuration affects the size of the output hash, it does not have a substantial impact on overall system performance."
