    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option _n is performance-sensitive. This is because the value of _n directly impacts the length of byte arrays used in various operations within the code. The code snippet shows that if the length of a byte array is less than _n, padding operations are performed, which can be time-expensive and memory-expensive. Additionally, the frequency of triggering _n in loops can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, especially if _n is set to a suboptimal value. Therefore, the configuration _n directly and substantially affects system performance, making it performance-sensitive."
