    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The _hPrime configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly affects the hash function operations and byte array manipulations in the flap method. The configuration is initialized and used in critical parts of the code that contribute significantly to execution time and memory consumption. The operations involving _hPrime lead to notable performance variations at the system level, making it a performance-sensitive configuration."
