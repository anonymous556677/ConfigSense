    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option _k is performance-sensitive. The size of the byte arrays v and v2 directly depends on the value of _k, which impacts memory consumption. The larger the value of _k, the larger the byte arrays, leading to higher memory usage. This directly affects system performance at the memory level, making it performance-sensitive."
