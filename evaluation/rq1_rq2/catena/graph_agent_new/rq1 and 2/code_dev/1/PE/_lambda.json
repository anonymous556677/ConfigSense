    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The _lambda configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly affects the execution time and memory consumption within the catena function. The _lambda value is used to calculate the hash output length and is involved in multiple performance-related operations such as tweaking, updating, and truncating the hash. Any changes in the _lambda value can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, making it a performance-sensitive configuration."
