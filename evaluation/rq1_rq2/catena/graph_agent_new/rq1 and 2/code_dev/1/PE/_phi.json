{
    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration _phi is classified as performance-sensitive based on the code context provided. The method phi called within the configuration involves processing data, which can be time-expensive and memory-expensive operations. These operations can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, making the configuration performance-sensitive. Additionally, the developer's understanding that the impact of _phi depends on the heavy computations or data processing within the method phi further supports the classification of _phi as performance-sensitive."
