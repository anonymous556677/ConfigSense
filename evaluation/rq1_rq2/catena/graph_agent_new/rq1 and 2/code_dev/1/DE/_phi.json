It then calls a method get_phi() to get an instance of a class that has a method phi which is invoked with the parameters garlic, x, and m. This method is used to process some data related to the configuration _phi.",

Without further context or analysis, it is difficult to determine the exact frequency of this configuration being triggered in the system.",

If the method phi involves heavy computations or data processing, it could potentially impact the system's performance and resource utilization. Further analysis of the method's implementation is needed to determine the exact size impact on the system."
