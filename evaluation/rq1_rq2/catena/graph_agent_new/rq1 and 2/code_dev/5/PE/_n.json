    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option _n is performance-sensitive. The code context shows that the length of the byte array x is checked in multiple functions, and if it is less than _n, padding is applied. This padding operation directly impacts memory consumption and processing time at the system level. The configuration _n directly affects the performance of the system by introducing additional memory and processing overheads when handling byte arrays, leading to notable performance variations."
