    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The _d configuration does not directly and substantially affect system performance at the system level. Although it impacts the size of the input for graph size and affects the output length of the hash, the operations related to _d within the catena function do not contribute significantly to execution time or memory consumption. Therefore, the configuration is not considered performance-sensitive."
