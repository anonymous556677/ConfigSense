    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The _lambda configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly affects the number of iterations in the hashing process within the Catena function. The number of iterations can significantly impact the execution time and memory consumption of the hashing operation, leading to notable performance variations at the system level. Changing the _lambda value can have a substantial effect on the overall performance of the system, making it a performance-sensitive configuration."
