{
    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option _gHigh is performance-sensitive because it directly affects the number of iterations in a loop within the related code. The loop iteration count controlled by _gHigh can have a significant impact on the execution time and memory consumption of the system. A higher value of _gHigh leads to more iterations, resulting in notable performance variations at the system level. Therefore, based on the code context and the nature of the configuration's usage, _gHigh is classified as performance-sensitive."
