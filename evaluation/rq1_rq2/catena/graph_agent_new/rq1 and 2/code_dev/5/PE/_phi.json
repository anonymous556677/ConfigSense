    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The configuration _phi is not performance-sensitive based on the provided code context and developer information. The method simply delegates the call to the phi method from the get_phi() object without any additional performance-related operations or complexities. There are no time-expensive or memory-expensive operations within the _phi configuration code that would lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Therefore, the configuration _phi can be classified as not performance-sensitive."
