    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The _vId configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the size of the tweak generated in the compTweak function, which is crucial for the hashing and key derivation processes. The size of the tweak affects the output length and security of the generated hash or key, leading to notable performance variations at the system level. Additionally, the _vId configuration is used as a parameter in multiple functions that are called frequently, such as catena, keyDerivation, and serverReliefClient, further emphasizing its performance sensitivity."
