    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option _k is performance-sensitive. The code context shows that the value of _k directly impacts the size of byte arrays used in the flap function, which in turn affects memory usage and performance. Changing the value of _k will lead to notable performance variations at the system level due to the increased memory consumption and the number of iterations in the calculations."
