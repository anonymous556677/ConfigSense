    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The _gLow configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the loop iterations in key derivation, hashing, and proof of work functions. The starting value of the loop set by _gLow affects the execution time and memory consumption of these operations, leading to notable performance variations at the system level. The use of _gLow in controlling the behavior of these critical functions makes it a performance-sensitive configuration."
