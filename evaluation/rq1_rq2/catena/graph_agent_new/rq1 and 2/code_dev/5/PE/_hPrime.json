    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The _hPrime configuration is performance-sensitive. The flap method in the Catena class heavily relies on the _hPrime configuration for hash operations, which directly impacts the execution time and memory consumption of the system. The configuration is triggered frequently based on the number of iterations, leading to notable performance variations at the system level. Additionally, any changes to the _hPrime configuration could affect the output size of the generated byte arrays, further emphasizing its performance sensitivity."
