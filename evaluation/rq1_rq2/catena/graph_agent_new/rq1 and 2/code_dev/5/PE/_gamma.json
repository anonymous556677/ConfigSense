    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option _gamma is classified as performance-sensitive. This is because the gamma method involves processing parameters g, x, and gamma using the get_gamma() method, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The salt dependent update with random access on the hash array within the configuration code can be time-expensive and memory-expensive, impacting system performance significantly."
