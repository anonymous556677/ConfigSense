    "Reason": "The configuration option _gamma does not involve any performance-related operations that are time-extensive or memory-extensive within its related code. The method simply calls the gamma method from the get_gamma object with parameters g, x, and gamma to return a hash array. This operation is not likely to cause notable performance variations at the system level."
