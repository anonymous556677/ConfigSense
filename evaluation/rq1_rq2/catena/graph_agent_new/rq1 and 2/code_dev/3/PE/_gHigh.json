    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration _gHigh is performance-sensitive because it directly affects the number of iterations in the loop within the code context provided. The value of _gHigh determines the upper limit for the loop iterations, impacting the execution time and computational load of functions such as serverReliefClient, keyDerivation, and serverReliefServer. A higher value of _gHigh leads to more iterations, potentially causing notable performance variations at the system level."
