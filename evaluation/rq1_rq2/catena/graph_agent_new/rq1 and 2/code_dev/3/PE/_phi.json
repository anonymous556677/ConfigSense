    "Reason": "The configuration _phi is not performance-sensitive. The code snippet provided simply calls another method to return a byte array based on the input parameters. There are no time-expensive or memory-expensive operations within the configuration-related code that would lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Additionally, the impact of the configuration on system performance is limited to the byte array returned by the method, which may affect memory usage but does not have a substantial performance impact."
