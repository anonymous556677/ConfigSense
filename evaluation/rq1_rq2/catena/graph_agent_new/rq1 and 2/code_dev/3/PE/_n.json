    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option _n is performance-sensitive. The code snippet shows that _n directly affects the length of the byte array x, which is crucial for the hashing operations in the program. If _n is set to a value that requires frequent padding or truncation of x, it can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The triggering frequency of _n is dependent on the input data and the values of gLow and gHigh, indicating that changes in _n can have a significant impact on the execution time and memory consumption of the system."
