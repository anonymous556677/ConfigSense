    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option _gLow is performance-sensitive because it directly affects the number of iterations in loops within the code. The value of _gLow determines the starting value for the variable 'g' in multiple functions, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Changing the value of _gLow can impact the execution time and memory consumption of the functions that rely on it, making it a critical configuration for system performance."
