    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option _k is performance-sensitive. The code context shows that the value of _k directly affects the size of byte arrays used in the flap function, which in turn impacts memory consumption and execution time. Changing the value of _k can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, as it influences the number of iterations and array sizes in the flap function, making it a critical factor in system performance."
