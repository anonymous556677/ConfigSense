    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The _hPrime configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly affects the execution time and memory consumption of the system. The flap method, which utilizes the _hPrime configuration for hash calculations, is time-expensive and memory-expensive due to the iterations and array operations involved. Any changes to the _hPrime configuration can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, making it a performance-sensitive configuration."
