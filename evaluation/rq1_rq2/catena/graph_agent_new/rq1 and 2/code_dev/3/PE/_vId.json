    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration _vId is performance-sensitive because it directly influences the computation of the tweak value in methods like catena, keyDerivation, and serverReliefClient. The tweak value computation is a critical operation in cryptographic processes, and any variations in _vId can lead to notable performance differences at the system level. The code context shows that _vId is used in time-expensive and memory-expensive operations, impacting the overall execution time and memory consumption of the system. Therefore, the configuration is considered performance-sensitive based on its significant impact on system performance."
