    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The _lambda configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the output length of the hash generated by the Catena function. Changing the value of _lambda will result in different hash sizes, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The code snippet related to the _lambda configuration involves time-expensive operations like hash calculations and memory-expensive operations like array manipulations, which contribute significantly to the overall execution time and memory consumption of the system."
