    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option _hPrime is performance-sensitive. This is because the _hPrime configuration directly affects the system performance at the system level. The code context provided shows that the _hPrime configuration is used in the flap function, which involves time-expensive operations such as hash function updates and array manipulations. These operations contribute significantly to execution time and memory consumption, leading to notable performance variations at the system level. Therefore, the _hPrime configuration is considered performance-sensitive."
