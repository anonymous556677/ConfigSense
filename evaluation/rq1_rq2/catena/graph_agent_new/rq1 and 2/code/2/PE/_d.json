    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The configuration option _d is not performance-sensitive. The code context provided does not contain any performance-related operations that are time-expensive or memory-expensive. The configuration does not directly and substantially affect system performance at the system level, and it does not lead to notable performance variations. Therefore, based on the code analysis, the configuration _d is classified as not performance-sensitive."
