    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option '_n' is performance-sensitive. The code context provided contains multiple performance-related operations that are time-expensive and memory-expensive. The 'catena' function involves multiple iterations and hash calculations based on the value of 'n', which directly impacts the system performance at the system level. Additionally, the 'keyDerivation' and 'serverReliefClient' functions also have operations dependent on 'n' that contribute to notable performance variations. Therefore, the configuration '_n' is considered performance-sensitive."
