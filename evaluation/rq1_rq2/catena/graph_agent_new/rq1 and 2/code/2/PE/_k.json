    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option _k is performance-sensitive. The code context provided shows that the configuration value is directly used in multiple performance-related operations such as array initialization, array copying, and loop iterations. These operations contribute to the execution time and memory consumption of the program, leading to notable performance variations at the system level. Therefore, the configuration _k has a substantial impact on system performance and should be considered performance-sensitive."
