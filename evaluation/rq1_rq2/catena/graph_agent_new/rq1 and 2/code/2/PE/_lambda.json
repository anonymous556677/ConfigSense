    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option '_lambda' is performance-sensitive. The 'flap' function within the 'catena' method involves time-expensive and memory-expensive operations that contribute significantly to the execution time and memory consumption. The 'flap' function is called multiple times within the 'catena' method, leading to notable performance variations at the system level. Additionally, the 'keyDerivation' and 'serverReliefClient' methods also utilize the 'flap' function, further emphasizing the performance sensitivity of the '_lambda' configuration."
