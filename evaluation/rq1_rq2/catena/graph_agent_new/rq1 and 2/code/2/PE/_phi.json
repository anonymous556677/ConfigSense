{
    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The configuration option _phi does not appear to be performance-sensitive based on the provided code context. The phi method simply calls another method without any significant performance-related operations within its related code. There are no indications of time-expensive or memory-expensive operations that would lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Therefore, the configuration _phi is classified as not performance-sensitive."
