    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option '_gLow' is performance-sensitive. This is because the '_gLow' configuration directly affects the system performance at the system level. In the provided code context, the '_gLow' configuration is used in multiple performance-related operations within the 'catena' and 'keyDerivation' functions. The value of '_gLow' is used in calculations that impact the execution time and memory consumption of these functions, leading to notable performance variations at the system level. Therefore, based on the code analysis, the '_gLow' configuration is considered performance-sensitive."
