    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The configuration option _gamma does not appear to be performance-sensitive based on the provided code context. The gamma method simply calls another method from the get_gamma() object, which does not contain any performance-intensive operations. There are no time-expensive or memory-expensive operations within the gamma method itself that would lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
