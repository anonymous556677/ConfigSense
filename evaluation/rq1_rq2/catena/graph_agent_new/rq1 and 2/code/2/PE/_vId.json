    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option _vId is performance-sensitive. The code context shows that the _vId configuration is directly used in the compTweak method, which is called multiple times in different functions like catena, keyDerivation, and serverReliefClient. The compTweak method involves multiple time-expensive and memory-expensive operations that contribute significantly to the execution time and memory consumption of the system. Therefore, the _vId configuration directly and substantially affects system performance at the system level, making it performance-sensitive."
