    "Reason": "The configuration option '_f' is not performance-sensitive based on the provided code context. The code snippet provided does not contain any performance-related operations that are time-expensive or memory-expensive. The configuration '_f' simply calls the 'graph' method from the 'get_f()' function, which does not show any significant impact on system performance. Therefore, it can be classified as not performance-sensitive."
