    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The configuration option _gamma does not appear to be performance-sensitive based on the provided code context. The gamma method is simply calling another method get_gamma().gamma(g, x, gamma), which does not contain any performance-intensive operations. There are no time-expensive or memory-expensive operations within the configuration-related code that would lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
