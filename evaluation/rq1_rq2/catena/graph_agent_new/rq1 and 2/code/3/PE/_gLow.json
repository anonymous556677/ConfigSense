    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option '_gLow' is performance-sensitive. This is because the '_gLow' configuration directly affects the system performance at the system level by influencing the 'g' variable in multiple performance-related operations within the code context. The 'g' variable is used in loops that impact the execution time and memory consumption significantly, leading to notable performance variations at the system level. Therefore, any changes or variations in the '_gLow' configuration can have a substantial impact on the overall performance of the system."
