    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option _k is performance-sensitive. The code snippet provided involves multiple performance-related operations such as array copying, array initialization, and hashing operations which can be time-expensive and memory-expensive. These operations directly impact the execution time and memory consumption of the system, leading to notable performance variations at the system level. Therefore, based on the code context, the configuration _k is considered performance-sensitive."
