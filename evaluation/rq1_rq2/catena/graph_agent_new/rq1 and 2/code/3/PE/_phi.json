    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The configuration _phi does not appear to be performance-sensitive based on the provided code context. The phi method simply delegates the computation to another method without any complex or time-expensive operations. There are no indications of any performance-related operations that would lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Therefore, the configuration _phi is classified as not performance-sensitive."
