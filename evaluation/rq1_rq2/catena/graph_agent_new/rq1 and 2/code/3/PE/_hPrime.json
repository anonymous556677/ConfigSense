{
    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option '_hPrime' is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the '_hPrime' configuration directly affects the performance of the system at the system level. The code context provided shows that the '_hPrime' configuration is used in the 'flap' function, which involves time-expensive operations such as hash function updates and array manipulations. These operations contribute significantly to the execution time and memory consumption of the system, leading to notable performance variations. Therefore, the '_hPrime' configuration is considered performance-sensitive."
