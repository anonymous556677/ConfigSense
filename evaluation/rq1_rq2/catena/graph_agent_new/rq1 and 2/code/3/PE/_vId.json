    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option '_vId' is performance-sensitive. This is because the '_vId' configuration is directly used in multiple performance-related operations within the 'catena', 'keyDerivation', and 'serverReliefClient' methods. The 'compTweak' method is called with the '_vId' configuration, which contributes to time-expensive and memory-expensive operations. The 'catena', 'keyDerivation', and 'serverReliefClient' methods involve multiple iterations and calculations based on the '_vId' configuration, leading to notable performance variations at the system level."
