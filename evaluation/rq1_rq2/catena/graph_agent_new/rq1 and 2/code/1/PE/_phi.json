    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The configuration option _phi does not appear to be performance-sensitive based on the provided code context. The method phi() simply delegates the operation to another method get_phi().phi(), which does not show any time-expensive or memory-expensive operations. Therefore, there are no notable performance variations at the system level caused by this configuration."
