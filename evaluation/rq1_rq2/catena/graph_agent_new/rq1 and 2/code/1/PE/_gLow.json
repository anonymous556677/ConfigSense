    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option '_gLow' is performance-sensitive. This is because the '_gLow' configuration directly affects the performance of the system at the system level. In the provided code context, the '_gLow' configuration is used in multiple performance-related operations such as calculations, loops, and conditional checks. These operations contribute significantly to the execution time and memory consumption of the system, leading to notable performance variations. Therefore, the '_gLow' configuration is considered performance-sensitive based on its impact on system performance."
