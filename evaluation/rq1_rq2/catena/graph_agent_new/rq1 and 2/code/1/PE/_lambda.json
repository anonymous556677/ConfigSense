    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The configuration option '_lambda' is not performance-sensitive. The code context provided does not contain any performance-sensitive operations that directly and substantially affect system performance at the system level. The configuration-related code mainly involves hash calculations and key derivation, which are essential for security but do not lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
