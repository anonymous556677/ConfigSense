    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option '_gHigh' is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the '_gHigh' configuration directly affects the performance of the system at the system level. In the provided code context, the '_gHigh' configuration is used in a loop that iterates from 'gLow' to 'gHigh', and within this loop, there are performance-related operations such as padding with zero, flapping, concatenation, and truncation that contribute to notable performance variations. These time-expensive and memory-expensive operations within the loop make the '_gHigh' configuration performance-sensitive."
