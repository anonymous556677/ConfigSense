    "Reason": "The configuration option '_k' is not performance-sensitive. The code context provided does not contain any performance-sensitive operations that directly and substantially affect system performance at the system level. The operations within the 'flap' and 'hInit' functions are not time-expensive or memory-expensive, and they do not lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
