    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option '_hPrime' is performance-sensitive. The code context provided shows that the '_hPrime' configuration is directly involved in performance-related operations such as hash function calculations and array manipulations. These operations are time-expensive and memory-expensive, contributing significantly to the execution time and memory consumption of the system. Therefore, any changes or optimizations to the '_hPrime' configuration can lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
