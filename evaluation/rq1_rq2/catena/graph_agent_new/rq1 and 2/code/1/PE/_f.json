    "Reason": "The configuration option '_f' is not performance-sensitive. The code context provided shows a simple method 'f' that calls another method 'graph' from an external source. There are no performance-intensive operations or configurations within the code snippet that would directly and substantially affect system performance at the system level. The configuration does not involve any time-extensive or memory-extensive operations that would lead to notable performance variations."
