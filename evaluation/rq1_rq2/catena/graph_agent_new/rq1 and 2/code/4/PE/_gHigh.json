    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option '_gHigh' is performance-sensitive. This is because the value of '_gHigh' directly impacts the loop in the 'catena' function, which involves time-expensive and memory-expensive operations. The loop runs from 'gLow' to '_gHigh' and performs multiple operations on the data 'x', including padding, flapping, concatenation, and truncation. The value of '_gHigh' significantly affects the number of iterations in the loop, leading to notable performance variations at the system level. Therefore, '_gHigh' is considered performance-sensitive based on its impact on system performance and the related code context."
