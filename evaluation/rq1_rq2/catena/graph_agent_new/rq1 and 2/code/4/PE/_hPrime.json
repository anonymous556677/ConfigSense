    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option '_hPrime' is performance-sensitive. This is because the '_hPrime' configuration directly affects the system performance at the system level. The 'flap' function in the code context involves multiple performance-related operations such as array copying, hash function updates, and iterations that contribute significantly to execution time and memory consumption. These operations are time-expensive and memory-expensive, leading to notable performance variations at the system level. Therefore, the '_hPrime' configuration is classified as performance-sensitive."
