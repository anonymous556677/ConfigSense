    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option '_vId' is performance-sensitive. The code context shows that the '_vId' configuration is directly used in the 'catena', 'keyDerivation', and 'serverReliefClient' functions, which are performance-critical operations involving hashing, updating, and truncating byte arrays. The 'catena' function, for example, calls 'compTweak' with '_vId' as a parameter, which affects the hash computation. Any changes in '_vId' can lead to notable performance variations at the system level due to the time-expensive and memory-expensive operations involved in these functions."
