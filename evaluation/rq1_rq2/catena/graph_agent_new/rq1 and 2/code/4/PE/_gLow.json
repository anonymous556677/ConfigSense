    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option '_gLow' is performance-sensitive. This is because the '_gLow' configuration directly affects the system performance at the system level. In the provided code context, the '_gLow' configuration is used in multiple performance-related operations such as calculations for hashing, key derivation, server-client communication, and proof of work. These operations are time-expensive and memory-expensive, leading to notable performance variations at the system level. Therefore, the '_gLow' configuration is considered performance-sensitive."
