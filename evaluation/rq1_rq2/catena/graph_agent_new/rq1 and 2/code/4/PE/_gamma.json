    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The configuration option _gamma does not appear to be performance-sensitive based on the provided code context. The gamma method simply calls another method from get_gamma() without any significant performance-related operations within its code. There are no time-expensive or memory-expensive operations that would lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Therefore, the configuration _gamma is classified as not performance-sensitive."
