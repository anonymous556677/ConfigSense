    "Reason": "The configuration option '_vId' is not performance-sensitive. The code context provided does not show any direct and substantial impact on system performance at the system level. The configuration-related code does not contain any performance-sensitive operations that significantly affect execution time or memory consumption. Therefore, based on the analysis of the code context, the '_vId' configuration is classified as not performance-sensitive."
