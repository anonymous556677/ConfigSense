{
    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option '_lambda' is performance-sensitive. This is because the 'flap' function within the 'catena' method involves multiple iterations and memory-intensive operations, such as array copying and updates, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Additionally, the 'keyDerivation' and 'serverReliefClient' methods also utilize the 'flap' function, further emphasizing the performance impact of the '_lambda' configuration."
