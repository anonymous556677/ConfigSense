    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The configuration option _gamma does not appear to be performance-sensitive based on the provided code context. The gamma method simply calls another method get_gamma().gamma(g, x, gamma), which does not contain any performance-intensive operations that would lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Therefore, the configuration does not directly and substantially affect system performance or involve time-extensive or memory-extensive operations within its related code."
