    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The configuration option _phi does not appear to be performance-sensitive based on the provided code context. The phi method simply delegates the computation to another method without any visible time-expensive or memory-expensive operations. There are no performance-related operations within the configuration-related code that would lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
