{
    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option _hPrime is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the _hPrime configuration directly affects the system performance at the system level. The flap function, which uses _hPrime, involves time-expensive operations such as hash calculations and array manipulations. These operations contribute significantly to the execution time and memory consumption of the system, leading to notable performance variations. Therefore, the _hPrime configuration is considered performance-sensitive."
