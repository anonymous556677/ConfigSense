    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option '_gLow' is performance-sensitive. This is because the '_gLow' configuration directly impacts the performance of the system at the system level. In the provided code context, the '_gLow' configuration is used in multiple performance-related operations such as calculations, iterations, and conditional checks. These operations contribute significantly to the execution time and memory consumption of the system, leading to notable performance variations. Therefore, based on the code analysis, the '_gLow' configuration is classified as performance-sensitive."
