    "Reason": "The configuration option _f is not performance-sensitive. The code snippet provided does not contain any performance-related operations that are time-expensive or memory-expensive. The function f simply calls another function get_f().graph(g, x, lambda), which does not show any significant performance impact at the system level. Therefore, based on the code context, this configuration is not performance-sensitive."
