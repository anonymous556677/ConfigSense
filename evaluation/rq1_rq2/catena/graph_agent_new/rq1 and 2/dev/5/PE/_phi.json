    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The configuration _phi does not directly and substantially affect system performance at the system level. It is limited to the specific functionality of the phi method and does not have a notable performance impact on the overall system behavior. The developer's information also indicates that the impact of _phi is confined to calling the phi method with specified parameters, which further supports the classification of this configuration as non-performance-sensitive."
