    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The _hPrime configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the size of the output hash generated by the flap method, which can affect the overall performance and security of the system. The configuration involves performance-related operations within the flap method, which are time-expensive and memory-expensive. This can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, making it a performance-sensitive configuration."
