    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The _vId configuration is performance-sensitive because it is used as a parameter in the compTweak method, which involves time-expensive and memory-expensive operations. Additionally, the configuration is triggered multiple times in key system methods, leading to notable performance variations at the system level. The impact on the size of the output key in the keyDerivation method further emphasizes the performance sensitivity of the configuration."
