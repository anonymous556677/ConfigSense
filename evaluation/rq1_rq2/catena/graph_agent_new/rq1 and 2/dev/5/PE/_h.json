    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option _h is performance-sensitive. The main hash function h used in _h is critical for various hashing operations in the system, such as password hashing, key derivation, and server relief. These operations are time-expensive and memory-expensive, directly impacting system performance. The frequent triggering of _h in functions like catena, keyDerivation, serverReliefClient, and serverReliefServer further emphasizes its performance sensitivity. Changing _h can have significant performance implications at the system level."
