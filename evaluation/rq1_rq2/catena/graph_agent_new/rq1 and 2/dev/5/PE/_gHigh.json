    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option _gHigh is performance-sensitive because it directly affects the number of iterations in a loop, which can have a significant impact on the computational resources and time required to complete the hashing or key derivation processes. Higher values of _gHigh can lead to more iterations and increased resource consumption, resulting in notable performance variations at the system level. Additionally, the configuration involves performance-related operations (loop iterations) that are time-expensive within its related code, further emphasizing its performance sensitivity."
