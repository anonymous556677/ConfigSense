    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The _lambda configuration is not performance-sensitive based on the provided information. Although it impacts the size of the hash output generated by the Catena function, changing the value of _lambda does not directly and substantially affect system performance at the system level. The frequency of triggering the _lambda configuration depends on how often password hashing is required, but it does not lead to notable performance variations. Additionally, the developer's understanding indicates that the _lambda configuration is used as a parameter in various functions within the code, but there is no indication that it involves time-extensive or memory-extensive operations that would classify it as performance-sensitive."
