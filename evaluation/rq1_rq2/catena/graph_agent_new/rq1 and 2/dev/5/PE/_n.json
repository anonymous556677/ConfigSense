    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The _n configuration option is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the size of the hash output in the system, which can have implications on the security and performance. The developer mentioned that changing the value of _n will result in hash outputs of different lengths, and this configuration is triggered multiple times in functions like catena, keyDerivation, and serverReliefClient. These functions are likely to involve performance-related operations that are time-expensive or memory-expensive, leading to notable performance variations at the system level."
