    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration _gLow is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the starting point for a loop that iterates over a range of values, affecting the execution time and memory consumption of the system. The developer's explanation also indicates that _gLow is triggered frequently in functions that are critical to system performance, leading to notable performance variations at the system level. Additionally, the size impact of _gLow on the output generated by the functions further confirms its performance sensitivity."
