    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option _f is performance-sensitive. The code context indicates that the configuration is directly related to calling the graph method of the f function with parameters g, x, and lambda. This operation can be time-expensive and memory-expensive, leading to notable performance variations at the system level. As the configuration directly affects system performance by executing time-expensive and memory-expensive operations, it is classified as performance-sensitive."
