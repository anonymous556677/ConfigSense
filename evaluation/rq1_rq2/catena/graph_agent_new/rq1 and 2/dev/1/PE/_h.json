{
    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration _h is performance-sensitive because it directly affects critical security operations like password hashing and key derivation, which are time-expensive and memory-expensive operations. The choice of _h impacts the performance of these operations at the system level, leading to notable performance variations. Additionally, the configuration _h is triggered frequently whenever hashing functions in the Catena class are called, further emphasizing its performance sensitivity."
