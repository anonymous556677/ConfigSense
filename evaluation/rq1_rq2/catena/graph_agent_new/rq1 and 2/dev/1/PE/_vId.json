    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The _vId configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the size of the tweak generated in the compTweak function, which in turn affects the hashing and key derivation processes in the system. Changing the _vId value can lead to notable performance variations at the system level by influencing the execution time and memory consumption of these critical operations. Therefore, the configuration is considered performance-sensitive based on its impact on system performance and the related code context."
