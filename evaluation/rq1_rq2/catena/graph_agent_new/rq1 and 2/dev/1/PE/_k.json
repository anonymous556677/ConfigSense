    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration _k is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the size of byte arrays and the number of iterations in the flap function, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Changing the value of _k can affect memory usage and performance, as it influences the size of data structures and the amount of computations performed. Since the configuration is involved in performance-related operations that are memory-expensive and time-expensive within its related code, it can have a substantial impact on system performance."
