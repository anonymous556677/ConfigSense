    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The _hPrime configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the execution time and memory consumption at the system level. The developer's information indicates that _hPrime is used as the reduced hash function in the flap method, which is called based on the value of 'g'. Since hashing operations are typically time-expensive and memory-expensive, the choice of _hPrime significantly affects the performance of the system. Therefore, any changes or optimizations to the _hPrime configuration can lead to notable performance variations in the system."
