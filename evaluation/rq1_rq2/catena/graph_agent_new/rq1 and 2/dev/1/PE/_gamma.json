    "Reason": "The configuration option _gamma is not performance-sensitive based on the provided information. The developer's understanding indicates that the _gamma configuration is a method that updates a hash array based on the parameters passed to it. While the configuration is triggered whenever the gamma method is called in the code, there is no indication that it involves any time-expensive or memory-expensive operations that would lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Therefore, the configuration _gamma is classified as not performance-sensitive."
