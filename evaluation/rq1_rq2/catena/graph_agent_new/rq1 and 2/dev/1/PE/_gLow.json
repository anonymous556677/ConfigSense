    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option _gLow is performance-sensitive. The developer's information indicates that _gLow is used to determine the starting value for a loop that affects the behavior of the system. This loop is triggered multiple times in various functions, which suggests that the configuration has a significant impact on the system's performance. Changing _gLow can potentially impact the output of functions and overall security and performance of the system, making it a performance-sensitive configuration."
