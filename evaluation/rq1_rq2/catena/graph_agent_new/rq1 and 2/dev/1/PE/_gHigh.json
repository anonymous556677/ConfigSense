    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The _gHigh configuration option is performance-sensitive because it directly affects the computational load and processing time of functions that utilize it. Setting a higher value for _gHigh can lead to more intensive loop iterations, which can result in notable performance variations at the system level. The configuration involves performance-related operations that are time-expensive within its related code, making it a performance-sensitive configuration."
