{
    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option _phi is classified as performance-sensitive because it involves processing and manipulation of byte arrays, which can have a notable impact on system performance and memory usage. The method get_phi() is triggered whenever the phi method is called, and depending on the frequency of invocation and the size/complexity of the input parameters, it can lead to significant performance variations at the system level. Therefore, the configuration _phi is considered performance-sensitive based on its potential impact on system performance."
