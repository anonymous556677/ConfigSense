    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The _lambda configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the size of the output hash generated by the Catena function. Changing the value of _lambda can result in notable performance variations at the system level, as it affects the execution time and memory consumption of the password hashing process. Since the output hash size is crucial for system performance and security, any changes to _lambda can have a significant impact on overall system performance."
