    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option _n is performance-sensitive because it directly affects the length of the output hash, which in turn impacts the size of the data being processed. This configuration is triggered multiple times within the system in functions such as keyDerivation, catena, and serverReliefClient, where the length of the output hash is crucial. Any changes to this configuration can lead to notable performance variations at the system level due to the time-expensive and memory-expensive operations involved in handling the hash output length."
