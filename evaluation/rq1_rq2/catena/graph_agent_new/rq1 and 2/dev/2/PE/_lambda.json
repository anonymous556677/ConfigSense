    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The _lambda configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the number of iterations and calculations performed during the hashing process using the Catena algorithm. This can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, especially in terms of execution time and memory consumption. The frequency of triggering the _lambda configuration also plays a role in its performance impact, as it is invoked whenever the catena function is called to hash a password. Therefore, the configuration involves time-extensive and memory-extensive operations within its related code, making it performance-sensitive."
