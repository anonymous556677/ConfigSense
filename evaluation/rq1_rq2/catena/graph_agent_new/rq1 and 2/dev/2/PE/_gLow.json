    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The _gLow configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly influences the starting value for loops in various functions, impacting the behavior and output of the system. Since it is triggered multiple times in functions like catena, keyDerivation, serverReliefClient, and proofOfWorkServer, any changes to this configuration can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Additionally, the significant impact of _gLow on system calculations and iterations further supports its classification as performance-sensitive."
