    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The configuration option _n is used as a threshold to check the length of the byte array x and pad it with zeros if necessary. While this operation may have an impact on memory consumption, it does not directly and substantially affect system performance at the system level. The padding operation is a common practice to ensure consistency in the size of x, but it does not lead to notable performance variations. Therefore, the configuration _n is not considered performance-sensitive."
