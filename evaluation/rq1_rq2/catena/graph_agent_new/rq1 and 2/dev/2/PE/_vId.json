    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The _vId configuration is considered performance-sensitive because it is directly involved in performance-related operations within the compTweak, keyDerivation, and serverReliefClient methods. These methods are critical and time-expensive, as they involve computations based on various inputs. The _vId configuration impacts the size of the output generated by these methods, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Therefore, the _vId configuration has a substantial effect on system performance and is classified as performance-sensitive."
