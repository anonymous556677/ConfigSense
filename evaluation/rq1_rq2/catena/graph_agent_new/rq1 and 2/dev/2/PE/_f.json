{
    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option _f is classified as performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the configuration directly affects the system performance by calling the graph method of the f function with parameters g, x, and lambda. This operation involves time-expensive and memory-expensive operations within the related code, leading to notable performance variations at the system level. Therefore, the configuration _f has a substantial impact on system performance and should be considered performance-sensitive."
