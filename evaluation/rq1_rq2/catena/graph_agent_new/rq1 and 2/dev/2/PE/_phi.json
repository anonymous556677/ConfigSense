    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration _phi is performance-sensitive because it involves calling the phi method with parameters garlic, x, and m, which can potentially lead to time-expensive and memory-expensive operations within the phi method. This can cause notable performance variations at the system level, making the configuration impactful on system performance. Additionally, the frequency of triggering the _phi configuration whenever the phi method is called can further amplify its performance impact."
