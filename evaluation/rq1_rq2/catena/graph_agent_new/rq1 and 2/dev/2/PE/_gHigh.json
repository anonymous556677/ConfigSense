    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option _gHigh is performance-sensitive. This is because the value of _gHigh directly impacts the number of iterations in the loop, leading to potentially increased computational load and affecting the overall execution time of the code at the system level. The configuration involves performance-related operations (loop iterations) that are time-expensive within its related code, resulting in notable performance variations."
