    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration _k is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the size of byte arrays, the number of iterations in the flap function, and the value of l in the hInit function. These operations are time-expensive and memory-expensive within the related code, leading to notable performance variations at the system level. Changing the value of _k can significantly affect the performance and memory usage of the system."
