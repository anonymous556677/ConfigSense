    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The _hPrime configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the execution time and memory consumption of the system. The configuration is used in the flap method of the Catena class, which performs hashing operations. These hashing operations can be time-expensive and memory-expensive, leading to notable performance variations at the system level. Therefore, the _hPrime configuration is considered performance-sensitive based on its impact on system performance."
