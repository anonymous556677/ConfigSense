    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration _h is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the choice of the main hash function used in the Catena algorithm, which is crucial for hashing passwords and deriving keys. This choice of hash function can have a significant impact on the performance of the system, as different hash functions have varying levels of time and memory consumption. Therefore, any changes to this configuration can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, making it performance-sensitive."
