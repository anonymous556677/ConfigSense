    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option _gamma is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the _gamma configuration involves updating a hash array based on salt-dependent updates with random access using the gamma parameter. This operation is time-expensive and memory-expensive within its related code, leading to notable performance variations at the system level. Additionally, the triggering frequency of the _gamma configuration depends on how often the gamma method is called with the specified parameters, indicating a direct and substantial impact on system performance."
