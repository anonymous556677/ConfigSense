It then calls a method get_phi() to retrieve the phi object and calls the phi method on that object with the provided parameters. This configuration is responsible for processing data using the phi object.",

If the phi method performs complex computations or data manipulations, it could potentially have a significant impact on system performance and resource utilization."
