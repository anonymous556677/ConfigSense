    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option _h is performance-sensitive because it is directly involved in hashing and key derivation operations, which are time-expensive and memory-expensive operations. The choice of hash function for _h can significantly impact the performance of these operations at the system level. Therefore, any changes or optimizations to _h can lead to notable performance variations in the system."
