    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration _gHigh is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the number of iterations in a loop in multiple functions, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Changing the value of _gHigh can significantly affect the execution time and memory consumption of the functions using this configuration, making it a critical factor in system performance."
