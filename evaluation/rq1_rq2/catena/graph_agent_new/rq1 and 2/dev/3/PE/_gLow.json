    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The _gLow configuration is considered performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the starting value for loops that iterate over a range of values in the code. This can lead to time-expensive operations depending on the specific functions being executed, such as key derivation, server-client communication, and proof of work calculations. Changing the value of _gLow can have a notable performance variation at the system level, affecting the overall behavior and output of the system."
