    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration _k is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the size of the byte arrays used in the flap function, which in turn affects memory usage and processing speed of the system. A larger value of _k will result in larger arrays and potentially higher memory usage, leading to notable performance variations at the system level. The configuration involves memory-expensive operations within its related code, making it performance-sensitive."
