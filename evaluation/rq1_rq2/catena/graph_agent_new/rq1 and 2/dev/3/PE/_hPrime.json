    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The _hPrime configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the execution time and memory consumption at the system level. The developer mentioned that the _hPrime configuration is used as the reduced hash function in the flap method of the Catena class, which performs hash operations. Since hash operations are typically time-expensive and memory-expensive, any changes in the _hPrime configuration can lead to notable performance variations in the system. Additionally, the size of the output generated by the flap method is also affected by the _hPrime configuration, further emphasizing its performance sensitivity."
