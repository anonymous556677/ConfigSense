    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option _gamma is performance-sensitive because it involves performing salt-dependent updates with random access on a hash array, which can have a significant impact on the overall performance and security of the system. The get_gamma() method called by the _gamma configuration can be time-expensive and memory-expensive, leading to notable performance variations at the system level."
