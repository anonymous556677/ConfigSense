    "Reason": "The configuration option _n does not directly and substantially affect system performance at the system level. Although it is used in multiple places to adjust the length of data and padding, the impact on performance is not significant enough to cause notable performance variations. The triggering frequency of _n depends on the input data and specific operations, but it does not lead to time-expensive or memory-expensive operations that would classify it as performance-sensitive."
