    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The _vId configuration is performance-sensitive because it is directly involved in key operations like hashing and key generation, which are time-expensive and memory-expensive operations. The configuration impacts the size and content of the output, leading to notable performance variations at the system level. Additionally, the frequency of its usage in critical functions like catena, keyDerivation, and serverReliefClient can further amplify its performance impact on the system."
