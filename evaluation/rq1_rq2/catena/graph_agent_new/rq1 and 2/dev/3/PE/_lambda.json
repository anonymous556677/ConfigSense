    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The _lambda configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the execution time and memory consumption of the system at the system level. The developer's information indicates that the _lambda configuration is used in the catena function to calculate the hash of a password. Since the value of _lambda affects the iterations and calculations performed in the flap function, it directly influences the size of the output hash generated. This means that changes in the _lambda configuration can lead to notable performance variations in terms of execution time and memory consumption, making it a performance-sensitive configuration."
