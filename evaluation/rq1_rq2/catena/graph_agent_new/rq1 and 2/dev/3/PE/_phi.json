    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option _phi is classified as performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the _phi configuration involves calling the phi method, which processes data using the phi object. Depending on the complexity of computations or data manipulations performed by the phi method, it could have a significant impact on system performance and resource utilization. This configuration directly affects system performance at the system level by potentially causing notable performance variations due to time-expensive or memory-expensive operations within its related code."
