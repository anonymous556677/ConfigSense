    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration _k is performance-sensitive because it directly affects the size of byte arrays, number of iterations in the flap function, and calculation of l in the hInit function. These operations are time-expensive and memory-expensive, leading to notable performance variations at the system level. The configuration _k plays a crucial role in determining the efficiency of the code execution and memory consumption, making it performance-sensitive."
