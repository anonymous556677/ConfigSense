    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The _vId configuration is performance-sensitive because it is used as a parameter in functions such as catena, keyDerivation, and serverReliefClient, which involve time-expensive and memory-expensive operations like hashing, key derivation, and server-client communication. The frequency of triggering the _vId configuration depends on how often these functions are called, impacting the system performance. Additionally, the _vId configuration affects the size of the output generated by these functions, further emphasizing its performance sensitivity."
