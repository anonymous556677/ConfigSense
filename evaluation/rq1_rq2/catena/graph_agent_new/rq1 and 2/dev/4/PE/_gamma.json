    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option _gamma is classified as performance-sensitive. This is because the _gamma configuration involves a method that performs salt dependent update with random access, which can have a notable impact on system performance. The method is triggered whenever the gamma method is called, and depending on the frequency of invocation and the implementation of the method, it can contribute significantly to execution time and memory consumption. Therefore, the configuration _gamma directly and substantially affects system performance at the system level, making it performance-sensitive."
