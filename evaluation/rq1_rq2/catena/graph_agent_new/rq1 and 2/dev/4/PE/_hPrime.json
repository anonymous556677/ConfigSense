    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The _hPrime configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the size and efficiency of the hash function used in the flap method. The flap method is triggered frequently in the Catena class, and any inefficiencies in the hash function can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Since the configuration determines the output hash size, any changes to it can have a substantial impact on memory consumption and execution time, making it a performance-sensitive configuration."
