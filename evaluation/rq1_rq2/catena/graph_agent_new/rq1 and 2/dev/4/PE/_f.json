    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option _f is performance-sensitive because it directly affects system performance at the system level. The configuration is triggered whenever the f function is called, and the output of the graph method can impact the overall system performance and behavior. Additionally, the graph method may involve performance-related operations that are time-expensive or memory-expensive, leading to notable performance variations at the system level."
