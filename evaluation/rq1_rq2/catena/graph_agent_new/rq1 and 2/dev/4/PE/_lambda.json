    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The _lambda configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly affects the size of the output hash generated by the Catena function. Changing the value of _lambda can impact the overall performance and security of the system. Since the size of the output hash can have a significant impact on memory consumption and execution time, any variations in the _lambda configuration can lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
