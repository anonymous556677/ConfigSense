    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration _phi is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the system performance at the system level. The developer's explanation indicates that the _phi configuration involves calling the phi method with specific parameters, which can lead to notable performance variations depending on the implementation of the phi method and its interaction with other parts of the system. Since the phi method is time-expensive and memory-expensive, the configuration _phi can significantly affect the overall system performance."
