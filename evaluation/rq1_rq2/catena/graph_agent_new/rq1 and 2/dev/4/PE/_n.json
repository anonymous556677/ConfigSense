    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option _n is performance-sensitive because it directly affects the length of the output hash in various operations like hashing passwords, key derivation, and server relief client functions. If the length of the hash is less than _n, padding with zeros is performed, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The frequent triggering of _n in critical operations makes it a key factor in determining system performance, thus classifying it as performance-sensitive."
