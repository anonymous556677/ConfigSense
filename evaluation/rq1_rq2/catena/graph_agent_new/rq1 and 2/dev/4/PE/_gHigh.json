    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option _gHigh is considered performance-sensitive because it directly and substantially affects system performance at the system level. The value of _gHigh controls the number of iterations in a loop, which can have a significant impact on the execution time and memory consumption of the system. Higher values of _gHigh can lead to more iterations in the loop, potentially causing notable performance variations. Additionally, the configuration involves performance-related operations (loop iterations) that are time-expensive within its related code, further supporting its classification as performance-sensitive."
