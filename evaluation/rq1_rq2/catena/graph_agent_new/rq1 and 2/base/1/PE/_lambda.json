    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The _lambda configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly affects the execution time and memory consumption of the Catena function, which is used to hash passwords. The _lambda value impacts the size of the output hash generated, and changing it can significantly affect the overall performance and security of the password hashing process. The flap method, which is part of the Catena function, performs cryptographic operations based on configurations like the value of g and byte arrays, indicating that the _lambda configuration plays a crucial role in determining the system-level performance variations."
