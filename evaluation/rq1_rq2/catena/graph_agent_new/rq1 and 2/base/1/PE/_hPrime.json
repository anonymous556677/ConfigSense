    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The _hPrime configuration is performance-sensitive based on the provided code context. The flap method in the Catena class utilizes the _hPrime configuration for hash calculations, which involve time-expensive operations such as hash updates and array copies. These operations directly impact the execution time and memory consumption within the related code, leading to notable performance variations at the system level. Therefore, the _hPrime configuration is considered performance-sensitive."
