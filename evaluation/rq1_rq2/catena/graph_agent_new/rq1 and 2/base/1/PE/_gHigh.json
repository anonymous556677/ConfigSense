    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option _gHigh is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the value of _gHigh directly impacts the number of iterations in a loop within the code. This loop is crucial for generating the final output hash, and a higher value of _gHigh leads to more iterations, which can significantly affect the performance of the system. Therefore, any changes to _gHigh can have notable performance implications at the system level."
