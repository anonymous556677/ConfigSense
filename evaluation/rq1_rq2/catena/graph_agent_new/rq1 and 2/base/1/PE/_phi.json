    "Reason": "The configuration _phi is a simple method that delegates the processing to the phi method of the get_phi() object. The code snippet provided does not contain any performance-intensive operations or memory-intensive tasks. The configuration _phi does not directly and substantially affect system performance at the system level. Therefore, based on the code context and developer's information, the configuration _phi is classified as not performance-sensitive."
