    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option _k is performance-sensitive. The value of _k directly impacts the size of byte arrays and the number of iterations in the flap function, which are time-expensive operations. Additionally, it affects the calculation of l in the hInit function, which in turn impacts the size of the xLoop array, contributing to memory-expensive operations. These performance-related operations have a notable performance impact at the system level, making the configuration performance-sensitive."
