    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option _n is performance-sensitive. It directly impacts the size of the hash output and the length of the hashed values in the system. The code snippets related to the configuration show that it is used in various critical functions like catena, keyDerivation, and serverReliefClient to ensure the consistency and correctness of the output length. Any variations in the value of _n can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, affecting the overall security and functionality of the system."
