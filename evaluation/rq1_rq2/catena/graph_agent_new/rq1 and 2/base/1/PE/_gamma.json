    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option '_gamma' is performance-sensitive. The method 'gamma' within the configuration involves updating a hash array, which can be time-expensive depending on the size of the array and the complexity of the update operation. This operation directly impacts system performance as it involves memory-expensive operations that can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Therefore, the configuration '_gamma' is considered performance-sensitive."
