    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The _vId configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the computation of tweak values for hashing passwords, key derivation, and server-client communication. The value of _vId influences the cryptographic operations in key generation and hash computation, affecting the overall system performance and security. The configuration is extensively used in critical methods like catena, keyDerivation, and serverReliefClient, which are essential for system functionality and performance."
