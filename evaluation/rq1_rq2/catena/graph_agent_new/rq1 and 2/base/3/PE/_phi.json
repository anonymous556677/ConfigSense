    "Reason": "The configuration _phi is a simple method that delegates the call to the phi method of the get_phi() object. The code snippet provided does not contain any performance-related operations that are time-expensive or memory-expensive. Therefore, based on the code context and developer's information, the configuration _phi is not performance-sensitive."
