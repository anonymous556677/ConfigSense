    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option '_h' is performance-sensitive. The '_h' configuration is directly used as the main hash function in various hashing operations throughout the code, such as password hashing, key derivation, and server-client interactions. Any change in the '_h' configuration can significantly impact the performance of these operations, affecting the overall system performance at the system level. The '_h' configuration involves time-expensive and memory-expensive operations within its related code, leading to notable performance variations in the system."
