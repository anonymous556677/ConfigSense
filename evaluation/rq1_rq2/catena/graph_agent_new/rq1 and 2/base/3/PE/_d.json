    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The _d configuration is performance-sensitive. This is because the _d configuration is directly involved in determining the input for graph size within the catena function, which is a critical component of the hashing process. The configuration is triggered multiple times based on the value of g, impacting the overall hashing process. The size impact of the _d configuration on the input for graph size directly affects the execution time and memory consumption of the system, leading to notable performance variations at the system level."
