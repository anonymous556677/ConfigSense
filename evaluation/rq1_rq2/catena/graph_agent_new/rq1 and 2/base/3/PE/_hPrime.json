    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The _hPrime configuration is considered performance-sensitive based on the provided code context. The _hPrime configuration is directly involved in the flap method, which performs multiple iterations and hash function operations. These operations are time-expensive and memory-expensive, as they involve resetting the hPrime hash function, updating byte arrays, and performing hash calculations. The configuration directly impacts the execution time and memory consumption within the related code, leading to notable performance variations at the system level. Therefore, the _hPrime configuration is classified as performance-sensitive."
