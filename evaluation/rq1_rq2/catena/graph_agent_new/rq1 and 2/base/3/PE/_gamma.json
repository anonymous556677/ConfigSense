    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option _gamma is classified as performance-sensitive. This is because the gamma() method involves salt dependent update with random access on the hash array, which can potentially have a significant impact on system performance. The method is triggered whenever the gamma method is called, indicating that it may be a critical part of the system functionality. Additionally, the developer mentioned that the configuration option may affect the overall performance and security of the system, further emphasizing its sensitivity to performance variations."
