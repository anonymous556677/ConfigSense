{
    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option _gLow is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that _gLow directly affects the starting value for a loop in multiple functions such as catena, keyDerivation, serverReliefClient, and proofOfWorkServer. This loop iteration can have a significant impact on the execution time and memory consumption of these functions, leading to notable performance variations at the system level. Therefore, any changes to the _gLow configuration can directly and substantially affect the system's performance."
