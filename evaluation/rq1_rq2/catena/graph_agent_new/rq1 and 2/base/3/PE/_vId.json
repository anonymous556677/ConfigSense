    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The _vId configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the computation of tweaks in functions like catena, keyDerivation, and serverReliefClient. The value of _vId affects the length and content of the output generated by these functions, leading to notable performance variations at the system level. The configuration is extensively used in critical operations that contribute significantly to execution time and memory consumption, making it performance-sensitive."
