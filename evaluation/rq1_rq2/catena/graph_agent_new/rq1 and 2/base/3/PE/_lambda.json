    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The _lambda configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the number of iterations for the hashing process in the Catena algorithm. The code snippet related to the _lambda configuration involves multiple iterations and memory-intensive operations, such as concatenating byte arrays, updating hashes, and truncating results. These operations contribute significantly to the execution time and memory consumption of the system, leading to notable performance variations at the system level."
