    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The _gHigh configuration option is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the number of iterations in a loop within the related code. The value of _gHigh determines the upper limit for the loop iteration, affecting the computational load and execution time of functions like catena, keyDerivation, serverReliefClient, and serverReliefServer. A higher value of _gHigh leads to more iterations, potentially causing notable performance variations at the system level by increasing resource utilization and execution time."
