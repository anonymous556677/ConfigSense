    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option _n is performance-sensitive. The code context shows that the configuration _n is directly used to determine the length of byte arrays and to check if the length of a byte array is less than _n in a loop. This directly impacts the memory consumption and execution time of the system, as it involves padding byte arrays with zeros to meet the specified length. The repeated triggering of _n in the system and its impact on the size of byte arrays indicate that it leads to notable performance variations at the system level."
