    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The _vId configuration is performance-sensitive because it is directly involved in the computation of the tweak parameter in functions like catena, keyDerivation, and serverReliefClient. The compTweak function, which uses _vId as a parameter, contributes to the execution time and memory consumption of these functions. The _vId configuration impacts the size of the output generated by these functions, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
