    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option _gamma is performance-sensitive. This is because the gamma method called within the _gamma configuration involves updating a hash array based on salt-dependent logic, which can be time-expensive and memory-expensive operations. This can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, making it a performance-sensitive configuration."
