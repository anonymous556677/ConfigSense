    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration _gLow is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the number of iterations in the while loops within the code. The value of _gLow determines the starting value for the variable 'g', which controls the flow of the program and affects the size of the output generated by the functions. This directly influences the execution time and memory consumption of the system, leading to notable performance variations at the system level."
