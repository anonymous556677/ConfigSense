    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The _lambda configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly affects the execution time and memory consumption of the system. The code snippet related to the _lambda configuration is part of the catena function, which is responsible for hashing passwords. The _lambda value influences the input for graph size and the desired output length of the hash, impacting the complexity and length of the hash output. Changes in the _lambda value can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, making it a performance-sensitive configuration."
