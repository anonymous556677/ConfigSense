{
    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option _gHigh is performance-sensitive. The _gHigh value directly impacts the number of iterations in a loop within the code, affecting the execution time and memory consumption of the system. A higher _gHigh value leads to more iterations in the loop, potentially causing notable performance variations at the system level. Therefore, the configuration is considered performance-sensitive based on its direct and substantial impact on system performance."
