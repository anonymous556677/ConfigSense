    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The _hPrime configuration is considered performance-sensitive. The flap method heavily relies on the _hPrime hash function for hashing operations within a loop that iterates based on the value of 'g'. The configuration directly impacts the execution time and memory consumption of the system-level operations. Changing the _hPrime configuration can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, affecting the overall performance and security of the system."
