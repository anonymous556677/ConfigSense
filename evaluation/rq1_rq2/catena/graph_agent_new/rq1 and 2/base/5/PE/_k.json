    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option _k is performance-sensitive. The value of _k directly affects the size of byte arrays, the number of iterations in the flap function, and the value of l in the hInit function. These operations are time-expensive and memory-expensive, leading to notable performance variations at the system level. Changing the value of _k can impact the memory usage and performance of the system significantly."
