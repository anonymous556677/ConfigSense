    "Reason": "The configuration _phi is a simple method that delegates the call to the phi method of the get_phi() object. The code snippet provided does not contain any performance-intensive operations or logic that could lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Therefore, based on the code context and developer's information, the configuration _phi is not performance-sensitive."
