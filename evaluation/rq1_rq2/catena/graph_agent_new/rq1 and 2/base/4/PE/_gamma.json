    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option _gamma is classified as performance-sensitive. This is because the gamma method involves salt dependent update with random access, which can potentially have a notable performance impact at the system level. The method is related to hash array manipulation, which can be time-expensive and memory-expensive operations. Any changes or optimizations made to the _gamma configuration can directly affect the performance of the system, making it performance-sensitive."
