{
    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option _phi is classified as performance-sensitive. The method phi, which is called by _phi, involves potentially time-expensive and memory-expensive operations based on the implementation of the phi method. If the phi method is computationally intensive or requires significant memory resources, it could lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Therefore, the configuration _phi is considered performance-sensitive."
