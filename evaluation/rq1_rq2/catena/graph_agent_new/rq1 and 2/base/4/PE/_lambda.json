    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The _lambda configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly affects the number of iterations in the hashing process within the Catena function. Changing the _lambda value can lead to notable performance variations in the system level by influencing the execution time and memory consumption of the password hashing operation. The code snippet related to the _lambda configuration shows that it plays a crucial role in determining the hash output length and the number of iterations, which are time-expensive and memory-expensive operations, thus making it performance-sensitive."
