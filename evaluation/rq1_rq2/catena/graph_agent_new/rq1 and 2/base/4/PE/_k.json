    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option _k is performance-sensitive. The value of _k directly impacts the size of byte arrays used in the flap function, affecting memory usage and performance of the system. The flap function involves multiple memory-expensive operations such as array initialization, copying, and hashing, which are directly influenced by the value of _k. Any change in _k can lead to notable performance variations at the system level due to the significant impact on memory consumption and execution time of the operations within the flap function."
