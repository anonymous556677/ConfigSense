    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The _hPrime configuration is performance-sensitive. The flap function, which utilizes the _hPrime configuration, involves time-expensive operations such as hash function resets, updates, and byte array generation in a loop. These operations directly impact the execution time and memory consumption at the system level. Additionally, the _hPrime configuration is triggered frequently based on the 'g' parameter, leading to notable performance variations. Therefore, the configuration is considered performance-sensitive."
