    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option _gHigh is performance-sensitive. The value of _gHigh directly impacts the number of iterations in a loop within the configuration-related code. A higher value of _gHigh will lead to more iterations in the loop, potentially increasing the computational load on the system. This can result in notable performance variations at the system level, making the configuration performance-sensitive."
