    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option _f is classified as performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the f function calls the graph method, which is a performance-related operation that could have a notable impact on system performance. Since the code snippet provided does not contain the implementation details of the graph method, it is assumed that the method could potentially be time-expensive or memory-expensive, leading to significant performance variations at the system level when _f is triggered."
