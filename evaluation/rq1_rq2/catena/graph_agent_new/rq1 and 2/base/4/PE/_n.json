    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option _n is classified as performance-sensitive. The code snippet shows that the value of _n directly impacts the length of the byte array x, leading to potential memory usage variations. If the length of x is less than _n, padding with zeros occurs, which can affect the execution time and memory consumption. This behavior can cause notable performance variations at the system level, making the configuration performance-sensitive."
