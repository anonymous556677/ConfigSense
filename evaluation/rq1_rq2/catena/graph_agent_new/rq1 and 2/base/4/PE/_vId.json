    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The _vId configuration is performance-sensitive based on the code context analysis. The _vId parameter is directly used in critical methods like catena, keyDerivation, and serverReliefClient, where it influences the computation of hash values and generation of keys. These methods involve time-expensive and memory-expensive operations like hashing, concatenation, and truncation, which directly impact system performance. Therefore, the _vId configuration leads to notable performance variations at the system level, making it performance-sensitive."
