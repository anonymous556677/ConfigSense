    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The configuration _f is triggered whenever the f function is called in the code. The frequency of triggering depends on how often the f function is invoked.",

If the graph method has a high computational cost or memory usage, it could impact the overall performance of the system when _f is triggered."
