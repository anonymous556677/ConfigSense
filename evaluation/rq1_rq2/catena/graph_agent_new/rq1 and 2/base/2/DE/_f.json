    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The configuration _f is a function called f that takes three parameters: an integer g, a 2D byte array x, and an integer lambda. It then calls the graph method of the object's f field with these parameters and returns the result.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The configuration _f is triggered whenever the f function is called in the code. The frequency of triggering depends on how often the f function is invoked in the application.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the _f configuration option on the system is determined by the efficiency and complexity of the graph method implementation in the f object. If the graph method has a high computational cost or memory usage, it could impact the overall performance and resource consumption of the system."
