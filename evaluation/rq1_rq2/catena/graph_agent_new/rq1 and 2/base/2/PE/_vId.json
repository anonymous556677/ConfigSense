    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The _vId configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly affects the computation of the tweak value used in critical functions like catena, keyDerivation, and serverReliefClient. The tweak value influences the hashing process, impacting the execution time and memory consumption of these functions. Changing the _vId value can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, affecting the overall security and performance of the system."
