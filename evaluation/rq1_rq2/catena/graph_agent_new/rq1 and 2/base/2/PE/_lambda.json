    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The _lambda configuration is performance-sensitive. The configuration is directly involved in the calculation of the hash of a password using the Catena function. The value of _lambda impacts the output length of the hash, which can have a significant effect on system performance and security. The compTweak function, which uses _lambda as a parameter, is a time-expensive operation within the code context, contributing to notable performance variations at the system level."
