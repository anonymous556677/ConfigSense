    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option _gamma is classified as performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the gamma method within the configuration involves salt-dependent update with random access, which can potentially be time-expensive and memory-expensive operations. This method directly affects the performance at the system level by returning a hash array after performing these operations. The complexity and size of the hash array can impact the system's performance and resource usage, making this configuration performance-sensitive."
