    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option _h is performance-sensitive. The choice of hash function directly impacts the execution time and memory consumption of hashing and key derivation operations in the system. The _h configuration is used in critical functions like catena, flap, keyedPasswordHashing, keyDerivation, serverReliefClient, and serverReliefServer, which are time-expensive and memory-expensive operations. Any changes or inefficiencies in the _h configuration can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, affecting the overall performance of the system."
