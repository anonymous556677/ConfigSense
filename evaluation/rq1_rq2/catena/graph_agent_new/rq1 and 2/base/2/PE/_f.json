    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option _f is classified as performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the f function calls the graph method, which is not found in the provided code context. However, based on the developer's understanding, if the graph method has a high computational cost or memory usage, it could significantly impact the overall performance and resource consumption of the system. Therefore, the configuration _f is considered performance-sensitive as it involves potentially time-expensive or memory-expensive operations within its related code that could lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
