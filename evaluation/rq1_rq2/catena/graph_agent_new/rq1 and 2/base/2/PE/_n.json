    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option _n is performance-sensitive because it directly affects the size of the byte array x in the code. If the length of x is less than _n, it undergoes padding with zeros, which can impact the efficiency of the hashing functions, key derivation, and server relief client operations. This size impact at the code level can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, making it performance-sensitive."
