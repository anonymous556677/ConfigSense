    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The _hPrime configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly affects the execution time and memory consumption of the system. In the flap() method, the _hPrime configuration is used as the reduced hash function for performing hashing operations. The number of iterations in the flap() method and the size of the output hash are directly impacted by the _hPrime configuration, leading to notable performance variations at the system level. Additionally, the _hPrime configuration is triggered whenever the flap() method is called, which can have a significant impact on the system performance based on the value of 'g' passed to it."
