{
    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option _gHigh is classified as performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the value of _gHigh directly impacts the number of iterations in the loop within the code context. A higher value of _gHigh leads to more iterations in the loop, potentially increasing computation time and resource consumption at the system level. This configuration directly affects the performance of the system by influencing the execution time and memory consumption of the operations within the loop, making it performance-sensitive."
