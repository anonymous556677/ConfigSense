    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option '_hPrime' is performance-sensitive. The 'flap' method, which utilizes the '_hPrime' configuration, involves time-expensive operations such as hash calculations and array manipulations. These operations directly impact the system performance at the system level by consuming significant execution time and memory. Additionally, the 'init' method initializes various variables and functions using the '_hPrime' configuration, indicating its importance in the performance of the system."
