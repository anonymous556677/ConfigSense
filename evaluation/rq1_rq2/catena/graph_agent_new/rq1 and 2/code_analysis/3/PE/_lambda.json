    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option _lambda is performance-sensitive. The code context provided contains performance-related operations that contribute significantly to execution time and memory consumption. The flap method, which is part of the configuration-related code, involves multiple iterations of hashing and concatenation, which are time-expensive operations. These operations directly impact the system performance at the system level, leading to notable performance variations. Therefore, based on the code analysis, the _lambda configuration is classified as performance-sensitive."
