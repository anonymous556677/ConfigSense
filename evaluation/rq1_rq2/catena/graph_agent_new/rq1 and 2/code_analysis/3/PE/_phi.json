    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The configuration option _phi is not performance-sensitive based on the provided code context. The phi method simply calls the get_phi method to retrieve the _phi object, which does not involve any performance-intensive operations. Additionally, the code snippet provided does not show any performance-related operations that would lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Therefore, the configuration _phi is not considered performance-sensitive."
