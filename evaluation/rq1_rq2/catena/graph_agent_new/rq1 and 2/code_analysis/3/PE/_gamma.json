    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The configuration option _gamma is not performance-sensitive based on the provided code context. The gamma() method simply calls another method get_gamma() to retrieve a GammaInterface object, which does not involve any performance-intensive operations. The code snippet provided does not show any performance-related operations that would lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Therefore, the configuration _gamma is classified as not performance-sensitive."
