    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option _vId is performance-sensitive. The code context provided shows that the _vId configuration is directly used in the compTweak method, which is called multiple times in different functions like catena, keyDerivation, and serverReliefClient. The compTweak method involves time-expensive and memory-expensive operations such as concatenation, updating, and truncating byte arrays, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Therefore, the _vId configuration has a direct and substantial impact on system performance, making it performance-sensitive."
