    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option '_n' is performance-sensitive. The 'catena' method contains multiple performance-related operations such as updating the hash, concatenating byte arrays, and performing multiple iterations based on the value of 'g'. These operations are time-expensive and memory-expensive, leading to notable performance variations at the system level. Additionally, the 'keyDerivation' method also involves performance-related operations like updating the hash, concatenating byte arrays, and performing multiple iterations based on the value of 'g'. These operations contribute to significant performance impacts, making the configuration performance-sensitive."
