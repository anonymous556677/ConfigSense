    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option '_gHigh' is performance-sensitive. The code context shows that the '_gHigh' configuration directly impacts the performance of the 'catena' function by determining the loop limit for the 'g' variable. The loop that iterates from 'gLow' to 'gHigh' has performance-related operations that are time-expensive and memory-expensive, as it involves multiple hash updates and truncations. This loop directly and substantially affects system performance at the system level, leading to notable performance variations. Therefore, the '_gHigh' configuration is classified as performance-sensitive."
