    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option '_gLow' is performance-sensitive. The '_gLow' configuration directly affects the performance of the system at the system level. In the provided code context, the '_gLow' configuration is used in the 'catena' function and 'keyDerivation' function to calculate the value of 'g' which is then used in the 'flap' function. The 'flap' function performs time-expensive and memory-expensive operations on input data, leading to notable performance variations at the system level. Therefore, the '_gLow' configuration is considered performance-sensitive based on its impact on system performance."
