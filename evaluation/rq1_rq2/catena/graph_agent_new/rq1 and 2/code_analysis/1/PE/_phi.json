    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The configuration option _phi is not performance-sensitive based on the provided code context. The phi method simply calls the get_phi method to retrieve a PhiInterface object, which does not involve any time-expensive or memory-expensive operations. The code snippet provided does not show any direct and substantial impact on system performance at the system level. Therefore, the configuration _phi is classified as not performance-sensitive."
