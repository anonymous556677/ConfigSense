{
    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option _k is performance-sensitive. The code context provided contains multiple performance-related operations that are time-expensive and memory-expensive. The flap function involves multiple iterations and array operations that can have a notable performance impact at the system level. Additionally, the hInit method also includes multiple iterations and hash operations that contribute to the performance sensitivity of the configuration. Therefore, based on the code context analysis, the configuration _k is classified as performance-sensitive."
