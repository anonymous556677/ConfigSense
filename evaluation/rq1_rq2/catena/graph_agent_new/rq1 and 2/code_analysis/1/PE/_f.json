    "Reason": "The configuration option '_f' is not performance-sensitive. The code snippet provided does not contain any performance-related operations that are time-expensive or memory-expensive. The method 'graph' mentioned in the code context is not found, so there is no clear indication of any performance impact at the system level. Without more information on the 'graph' method and its related code, it is difficult to determine any notable performance variations caused by the configuration '_f'."
