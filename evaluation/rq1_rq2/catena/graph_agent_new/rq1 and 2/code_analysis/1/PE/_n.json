    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option '_n' is performance-sensitive. The 'catena' method contains performance-related operations that are time-expensive and memory-expensive, such as updating the hash, concatenating byte arrays, and performing multiple iterations based on the value of 'g'. These operations directly and substantially affect system performance at the system level, leading to notable performance variations. The 'keyDerivation' and 'serverReliefClient' methods also involve similar performance-related operations, further confirming the performance sensitivity of the configuration."
