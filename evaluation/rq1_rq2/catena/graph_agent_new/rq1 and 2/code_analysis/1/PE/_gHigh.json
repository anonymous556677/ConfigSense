    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option '_gHigh' is performance-sensitive. The '_gHigh' configuration directly affects the system performance at the system level. In the provided code context, the '_gHigh' configuration is used in a loop that iterates from 'gLow' to 'gHigh', performing operations that contribute to execution time and memory consumption. The loop involves multiple time-expensive and memory-expensive operations, such as padding with zero, concatenation, updating hash, truncating, and incrementing 'g'. These operations can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, making the '_gHigh' configuration performance-sensitive."
