    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option '_lambda' is performance-sensitive. The 'catena' method involves multiple time-expensive and memory-expensive operations such as hashing, concatenation, updating, and truncating, which directly impact system performance. These operations are crucial for generating the hash of the password and key derivation process, leading to notable performance variations at the system level."
