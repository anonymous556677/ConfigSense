    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option '_hPrime' is performance-sensitive. The configuration directly affects the system performance at the system level by initializing the 'hPrime' reduced hash function, which is used extensively in the 'flap' method. The 'flap' method performs multiple time-expensive and memory-expensive operations, such as hash updates and array copies, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Additionally, the 'hPrime' configuration is crucial for setting up other components like the graph interface in Catena, further emphasizing its performance sensitivity."
