    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option '_gLow' is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the '_gLow' configuration directly impacts the performance of the 'catena' function, 'keyDerivation' function, 'serverReliefClient' function, and 'proofOfWorkServer' function. The '_gLow' configuration is used in multiple places within these functions to calculate the value of 'g' which affects the execution time and memory consumption. The 'catena' function, 'keyDerivation' function, 'serverReliefClient' function, and 'proofOfWorkServer' function all have performance-related operations that are time-expensive and memory-expensive, leading to notable performance variations at the system level."
