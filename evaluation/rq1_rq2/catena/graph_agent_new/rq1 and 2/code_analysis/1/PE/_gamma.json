    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option _gamma is performance-sensitive. The code context shows that the _gamma configuration is being used in the gamma() method, which involves salt-dependent update with random access. This method is likely to have time-expensive and memory-expensive operations, as it deals with hash arrays and involves cryptographic operations. Since the gamma() method directly uses the _gamma configuration and performs operations that can have a notable performance impact at the system level, the configuration _gamma is classified as performance-sensitive."
