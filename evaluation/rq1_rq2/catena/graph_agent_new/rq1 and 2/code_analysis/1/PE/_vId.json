    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option _vId is performance-sensitive. The configuration is directly related to the method calls in the code context, such as compTweak, get_vId(), get_d(), get_lambda(), etc., which involve time-expensive and memory-expensive operations. These operations contribute significantly to the execution time and memory consumption at the system level. The configuration directly affects the performance of the system by influencing the hashing and key derivation processes, leading to notable performance variations."
