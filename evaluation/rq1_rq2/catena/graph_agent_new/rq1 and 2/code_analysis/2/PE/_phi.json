    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The configuration option _phi is not performance-sensitive based on the provided code context. The method phi() simply returns the result of get_phi().phi(garlic, x, m), which does not involve any performance-related operations that are time-expensive or memory-expensive. Additionally, the method get_phi() is used to retrieve a PhiInterface object, which does not directly and substantially affect system performance at the system level. Therefore, the configuration _phi does not lead to notable performance variations and is not considered performance-sensitive."
