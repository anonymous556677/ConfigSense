    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option '_lambda' is performance-sensitive. The 'catena' method contains performance-related operations that are time-expensive and memory-expensive, such as 'flap' method calls and hash updates. These operations directly and substantially affect system performance at the system level, leading to notable performance variations. The 'keyDerivation' and 'serverReliefClient' methods also involve time-expensive operations like hash updates and byte array concatenations, contributing to significant performance impacts."
