    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option _gamma is performance-sensitive. The gamma() method is directly related to system performance as it involves salt-dependent update with random access, which can have notable performance variations. The method calls get_gamma() to retrieve the _gamma configuration object, which is crucial for the performance of the gamma() method. Therefore, any changes or optimizations in the _gamma configuration can directly impact system performance."
