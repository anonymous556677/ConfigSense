    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option '_gLow' is performance-sensitive. This is because the value of '_gLow' directly affects the execution flow within the 'catena' function and 'keyDerivation' function. The '_gLow' value is used in calculations that determine the iterations and operations performed within these functions, leading to notable performance variations at the system level. Changes in the '_gLow' configuration can significantly impact the time-expensive and memory-expensive operations within the related code, making it performance-sensitive."
