    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option '_vId' is performance-sensitive. The code context provided contains performance-related operations that contribute to execution time and memory consumption, such as byte array manipulations, updates, and concatenations. These operations are time-expensive and memory-expensive, leading to notable performance variations at the system level. Additionally, the configuration '_vId' directly affects the performance of the system by influencing the hashing and key derivation processes, which are critical for system performance."
