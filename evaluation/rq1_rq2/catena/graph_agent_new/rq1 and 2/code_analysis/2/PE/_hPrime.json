    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option '_hPrime' is performance-sensitive. The 'flap' method, which uses the '_hPrime' configuration, involves time-expensive and memory-expensive operations such as hash calculations and array manipulations. These operations are executed in a loop with a potentially large number of iterations, leading to notable performance variations at the system level. Additionally, the 'init' method initializes various variables and functions using the '_hPrime' configuration, indicating its direct impact on system performance."
