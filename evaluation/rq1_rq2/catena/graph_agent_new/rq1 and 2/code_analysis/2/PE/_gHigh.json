    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option _gHigh is performance-sensitive. The code snippet related to _gHigh involves a loop that iterates from gLow to gHigh, performing operations that can have a notable impact on system performance. The loop includes multiple time-expensive and memory-expensive operations such as padding with zero, concatenation, hashing, and truncation. These operations contribute significantly to the execution time and memory consumption at the system level, making _gHigh a performance-sensitive configuration."
