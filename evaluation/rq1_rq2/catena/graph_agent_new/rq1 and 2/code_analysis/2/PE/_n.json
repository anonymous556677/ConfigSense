    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option _n is performance-sensitive. The code context provided contains multiple performance-related operations that are time-expensive and memory-expensive. The catena method, keyDerivation method, clientIndependentUpdate method, and serverReliefClient method all involve operations that contribute significantly to execution time and memory consumption. These operations directly and substantially affect system performance at the system level, leading to notable performance variations. The configuration _n is involved in multiple loops and conditional statements that impact the performance of the system, making it performance-sensitive."
