    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option _k is performance-sensitive. The configuration directly affects the performance of the system at the system level. In the provided code context, the configuration _k is used to determine the size of byte arrays and iterations, which can have a significant impact on memory consumption and execution time. The operations related to _k, such as array size initialization and copying, are time-expensive and memory-expensive, leading to notable performance variations at the system level."
