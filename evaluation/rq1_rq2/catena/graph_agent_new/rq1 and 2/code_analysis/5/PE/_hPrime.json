{
    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option '_hPrime' is performance-sensitive. The '_hPrime' configuration directly affects the system performance at the system level by initializing the reduced hash function 'hPrime' and setting up various variables and functions with default values. The 'init' method, which involves the '_hPrime' configuration, performs multiple time-expensive and memory-expensive operations such as array copying, hash function updates, and function calls. These operations contribute significantly to the execution time and memory consumption of the system, leading to notable performance variations. Therefore, the '_hPrime' configuration is classified as performance-sensitive based on the code context and its impact on system performance."
