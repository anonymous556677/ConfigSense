    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The configuration option _f is not performance-sensitive based on the provided code context. The f method simply calls the graph method from the get_f() object, and there is no indication of any time-expensive or memory-expensive operations within the code snippet. Additionally, the code snippet does not show any direct and substantial impact on system performance at the system level. Therefore, the configuration _f is classified as not performance-sensitive."
