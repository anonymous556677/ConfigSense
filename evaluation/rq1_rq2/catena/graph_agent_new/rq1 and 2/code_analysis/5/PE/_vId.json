    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The configuration option '_vId' is not performance-sensitive based on the provided code context. The code snippets related to the '_vId' configuration do not contain any time-expensive or memory-expensive operations that would lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The operations within the 'catena', 'keyDerivation', and 'serverReliefClient' methods are focused on hashing passwords, key derivation, and client-server interactions, but they do not directly and substantially affect system performance in a significant way. Therefore, the '_vId' configuration is not classified as performance-sensitive."
