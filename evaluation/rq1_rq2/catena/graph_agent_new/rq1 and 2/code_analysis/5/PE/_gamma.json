    "Reason": "The configuration option _gamma is not considered performance-sensitive based on the provided code context. The gamma method simply calls the get_gamma() method to retrieve a GammaInterface object and return the result. There are no performance-intensive operations or significant performance variations at the system level caused by this configuration. The code snippet provided does not show any time-expensive or memory-expensive operations related to the _gamma configuration."
