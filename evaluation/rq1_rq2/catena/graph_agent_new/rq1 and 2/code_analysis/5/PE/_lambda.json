{
    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option _lambda is performance-sensitive. The flap method, which is a crucial part of the Catena hashing algorithm implementation, involves time-expensive operations such as hashing, concatenation, and iteration. These operations directly impact the execution time and memory consumption of the system, leading to notable performance variations at the system level. Therefore, based on the code context and the nature of the operations within the flap method, the configuration _lambda is classified as performance-sensitive."
