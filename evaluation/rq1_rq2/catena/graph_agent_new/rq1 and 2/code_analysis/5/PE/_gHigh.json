{
    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option '_gHigh' is performance-sensitive. The code snippet related to '_gHigh' involves a loop that iterates from 'gLow' to 'gHigh' and performs memory-expensive operations like padding with zero, concatenation, and truncation. These operations directly impact the execution time and memory consumption of the system, leading to notable performance variations at the system level. Therefore, the configuration '_gHigh' is classified as performance-sensitive."
