{
    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option _n is performance-sensitive. The configuration directly affects the system performance at the system level by involving performance-related operations that are time-expensive within its related code. The catena function and its related methods such as flap, hInit, clientIndependentUpdate, keyDerivation, and serverReliefClient perform operations that contribute significantly to execution time and memory consumption. The flap method, in particular, utilizes configuration parameters such as k, lambda, and hPrime to perform calculations that impact system performance. Therefore, based on the code context and the utilization of performance-related operations, the configuration _n is classified as performance-sensitive."
