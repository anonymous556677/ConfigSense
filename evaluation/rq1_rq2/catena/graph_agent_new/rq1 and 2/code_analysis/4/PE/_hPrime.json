    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option '_hPrime' is performance-sensitive. The '_hPrime' configuration directly affects the system performance at the system level. The 'flap' method, which utilizes the '_hPrime' configuration, involves time-expensive and memory-expensive operations such as hash computations and array manipulations. These operations contribute significantly to the execution time and memory consumption of the system, leading to notable performance variations. Therefore, the '_hPrime' configuration is considered performance-sensitive based on the code context and the impact on system performance."
