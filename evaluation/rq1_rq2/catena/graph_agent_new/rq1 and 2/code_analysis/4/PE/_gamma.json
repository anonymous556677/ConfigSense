    "Reason": "The configuration option _gamma is not performance-sensitive based on the provided code context. The code snippet provided shows that the _gamma configuration is simply being retrieved and used in the gamma() method to perform an update with random access. There are no performance-intensive operations or significant performance variations at the system level directly attributed to this configuration. The get_gamma() method is just retrieving a configuration object and not performing any time-expensive or memory-expensive operations."
