    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option _gLow is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the _gLow configuration directly affects the performance of the system at the system level. The _gLow configuration is used in the flap function within the catena method, which is a time-expensive operation contributing to the execution time of the system. The flap function manipulates input data and generates the final hash output, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Therefore, based on the code context and the usage of _gLow within performance-related operations, it is classified as performance-sensitive."
