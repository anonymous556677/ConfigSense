    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option '_lambda' is performance-sensitive. The 'catena' method contains performance-related operations such as 'flap', 'update', 'doFinal', 'paddWithZero', 'truncate', and 'concatenateByteArrays' which are time-expensive and memory-expensive. These operations directly and substantially affect system performance at the system level, leading to notable performance variations. The 'keyDerivation' and 'serverReliefClient' methods also involve similar performance-related operations, further confirming the performance sensitivity of the configuration."
