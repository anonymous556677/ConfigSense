    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The configuration option _phi is not performance-sensitive based on the provided code context. The phi method simply calls get_phi() to retrieve the _phi object, which is then used in the phi method. There are no performance-related operations or significant performance variations at the system level caused by this configuration. Therefore, it is classified as not performance-sensitive."
