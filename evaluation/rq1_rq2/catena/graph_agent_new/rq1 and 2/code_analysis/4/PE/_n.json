    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option '_n' is performance-sensitive. The method 'catena' contains multiple performance-related operations such as updating the hash, concatenating byte arrays, and performing iterations based on the value of 'n'. These operations contribute significantly to execution time and memory consumption, leading to notable performance variations at the system level. Additionally, the method 'keyDerivation' also involves time-expensive operations like updating the hash, concatenating byte arrays, and performing iterations based on the output size. These operations directly and substantially affect system performance, making the configuration performance-sensitive."
