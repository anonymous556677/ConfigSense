    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option SNAPSHOT_TIME is performance-sensitive because changing its value can significantly impact system performance. For example, a shorter snapshot time may lead to more frequent snapshots being taken, increasing memory consumption and potentially slowing down the system. On the other hand, a longer snapshot time may reduce the frequency of snapshots but could also impact system responsiveness and overall performance."
