    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option MEDIA in the batik software project is performance-sensitive because changing its value significantly affects system performance. For example, increasing the media quality may lead to higher memory consumption and longer execution time, while decreasing the quality may result in faster processing but lower output quality. Therefore, any change in the MEDIA configuration can have a notable impact on system performance."
