    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The DESTINATION_TYPE configuration determines the type of destination for the output of the software. Changing this configuration can significantly impact system performance as it may involve different processing and resource utilization based on the destination type. For example, writing output to a file may require more memory and processing compared to writing output to a network socket. Therefore, the value change of DESTINATION_TYPE can cause notable variations in execution time and memory consumption, making it a performance-sensitive configuration."
