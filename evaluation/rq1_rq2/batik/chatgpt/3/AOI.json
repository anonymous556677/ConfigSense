    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option AOI in the batik software project is performance-sensitive because changing its value significantly impacts the rendering performance of vector graphics. A higher AOI value leads to increased accuracy in rendering, but also requires more computational resources and memory, resulting in longer execution times and higher memory consumption. Therefore, any change in the AOI configuration can have a noticeable effect on system performance."
