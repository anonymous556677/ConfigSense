    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option USER_STYLESHEET_URI in the batik software project is performance-sensitive because changing the value of this configuration can significantly impact the rendering performance of the application. The stylesheet URI determines the styling and layout of the content, and a change in this configuration can lead to notable variations in execution time due to the additional processing required for rendering with the new styles. Therefore, any modification to the USER_STYLESHEET_URI can have a direct impact on system performance."
