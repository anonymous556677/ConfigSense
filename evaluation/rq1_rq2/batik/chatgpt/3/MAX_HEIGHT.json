    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The MAX_HEIGHT configuration option in the batik software project is performance-sensitive because changing its value can significantly impact system performance. Increasing the MAX_HEIGHT value may lead to increased memory consumption and longer execution times, especially when rendering large images or complex graphics. Conversely, decreasing the MAX_HEIGHT value may improve performance by reducing memory usage and speeding up rendering processes."
