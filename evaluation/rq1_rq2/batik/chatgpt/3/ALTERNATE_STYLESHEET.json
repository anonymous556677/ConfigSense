    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The ALTERNATE_STYLESHEET configuration option in the batik software project is performance-sensitive because changing the alternate stylesheet can significantly impact the rendering time and memory consumption of the application. Different stylesheets may require different processing and rendering logic, leading to variations in execution time and memory usage. Therefore, any change in the ALTERNATE_STYLESHEET configuration can have a notable effect on system performance."
