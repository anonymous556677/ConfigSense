    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The INDEXED configuration option in the batik software project is performance-sensitive because changing its value significantly impacts the rendering performance of vector graphics. When the INDEXED option is enabled, the software uses indexed color models which can reduce memory consumption and improve rendering speed. However, if the option is disabled, the software may need to use true color models which can increase memory usage and slow down rendering performance."
