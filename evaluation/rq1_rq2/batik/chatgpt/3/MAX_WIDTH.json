    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The MAX_WIDTH configuration option in the batik software project is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the rendering process of images. A change in the MAX_WIDTH value can significantly affect the time taken to render images, leading to variations in execution time and potentially increased memory consumption. Therefore, it is crucial to carefully consider and optimize the MAX_WIDTH value to ensure optimal system performance."
