    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The EXECUTE_ONLOAD configuration option in the batik software project is performance-sensitive because changing its value can significantly impact the system performance. When set to true, the software will execute certain tasks on load, potentially increasing the execution time and memory consumption. This can lead to notable variations in performance, making it a critical configuration to consider for performance optimization."
