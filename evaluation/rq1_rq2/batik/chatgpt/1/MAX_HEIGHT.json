    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The MAX_HEIGHT configuration option in the batik software project is performance-sensitive because changing its value can directly impact the rendering time and memory consumption of the system. A higher MAX_HEIGHT value may require more resources to render images, leading to longer execution times and increased memory usage. Conversely, a lower MAX_HEIGHT value may result in faster rendering but lower quality images. Therefore, any change in the MAX_HEIGHT configuration can significantly affect system performance."
