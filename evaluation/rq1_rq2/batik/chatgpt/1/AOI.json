    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The AOI configuration option in the batik software project is performance-sensitive because changing its value significantly impacts system performance. The AOI configuration affects the rendering quality of images, which directly impacts the execution time and memory consumption of the system. A higher AOI value results in better image quality but also increases the computational load, leading to longer execution times and higher memory usage. Therefore, any change in the AOI value can cause notable variations in system performance."
