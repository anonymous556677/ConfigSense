    "Reason": "The INDEXED configuration option in the batik software project is performance-sensitive because changing its value can significantly impact the rendering speed of images. When the INDEXED option is enabled, the software uses indexed color models which can reduce memory consumption and improve performance. However, if the option is disabled, the software may need to use true color models which can increase memory usage and slow down rendering speed."
