    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The MAX_WIDTH configuration in the batik software project is performance-sensitive because changing its value can significantly impact system performance. This configuration directly affects the rendering process of images in the software, and a higher MAX_WIDTH value can lead to increased memory consumption and longer execution times, especially when processing large images. Therefore, any changes to the MAX_WIDTH configuration can have a notable impact on the overall performance of the system."
