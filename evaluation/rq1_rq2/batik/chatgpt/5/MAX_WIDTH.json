    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The MAX_WIDTH configuration option in the batik software project is performance-sensitive because changing its value can significantly impact the rendering performance of images. A larger MAX_WIDTH value may require more memory and processing power to render images, leading to potential variations in execution time and memory consumption. Therefore, any changes to the MAX_WIDTH configuration can have a notable effect on system performance."
