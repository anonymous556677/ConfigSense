    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The WIDTH configuration option in the batik software project is performance-sensitive because changing its value significantly affects the rendering performance of images. A larger WIDTH value may require more memory and processing power to render the image, leading to increased execution time and potentially higher memory consumption. On the other hand, a smaller WIDTH value may result in faster rendering but lower image quality. Therefore, any change in the WIDTH configuration can have a notable impact on system performance."
