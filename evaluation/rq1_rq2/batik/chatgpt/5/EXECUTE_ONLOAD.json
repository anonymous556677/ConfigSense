    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option EXECUTE_ONLOAD in the batik software project is performance-sensitive because changing its value can significantly impact system performance. When set to true, the system will execute certain tasks on load, potentially increasing execution time and memory consumption. On the other hand, setting it to false may improve performance by deferring these tasks to a later time. Therefore, the value of EXECUTE_ONLOAD directly affects system performance, making it a performance-sensitive configuration."
