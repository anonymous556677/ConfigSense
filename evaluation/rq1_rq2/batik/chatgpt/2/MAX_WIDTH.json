    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The MAX_WIDTH configuration option in the batik software project is performance-sensitive because changing its value can significantly impact the rendering performance of images. A higher MAX_WIDTH value may require more memory and processing power to render larger images, leading to increased execution time and memory consumption. Conversely, a lower MAX_WIDTH value may result in faster rendering but lower image quality. Therefore, any change in the MAX_WIDTH configuration can have a noticeable effect on system performance."
