    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option SNAPSHOT_TIME is performance-sensitive because changing its value can significantly impact system performance. For example, a shorter snapshot time may increase the frequency of snapshots taken, leading to higher memory consumption and potentially longer execution times. On the other hand, a longer snapshot time may reduce memory usage but could result in slower performance due to fewer snapshots being taken."
