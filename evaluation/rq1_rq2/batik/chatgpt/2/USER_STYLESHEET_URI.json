    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option USER_STYLESHEET_URI in the batik software project is performance-sensitive because changing the value of this configuration can significantly impact system performance. For example, if the URI points to a large or complex stylesheet, it can increase the execution time of rendering operations, leading to performance degradation. Additionally, if the stylesheet is stored remotely, it can introduce network latency, further affecting system performance."
