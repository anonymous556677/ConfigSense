    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The WIDTH configuration option in the batik software project is performance-sensitive because changing its value significantly affects the rendering performance of vector graphics. A larger WIDTH value can lead to increased memory consumption and longer execution times, especially when rendering complex images with high resolutions. On the other hand, a smaller WIDTH value may result in faster rendering but lower image quality. Therefore, any change in the WIDTH configuration can have a noticeable impact on the overall system performance."
