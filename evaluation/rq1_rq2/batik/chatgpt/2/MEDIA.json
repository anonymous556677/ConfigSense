    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option MEDIA in the batik software project is performance-sensitive because changing its value significantly affects system performance. For example, increasing the media quality may lead to higher memory consumption and longer rendering times, while decreasing it may result in faster rendering but lower quality output. Therefore, any change in the MEDIA configuration can have a notable impact on the overall performance of the system."
