    "Reason": "The LANGUAGE configuration option in the batik software project is performance-sensitive because changing the programming language can significantly impact system performance. Different languages have varying levels of efficiency and optimization, which can lead to notable variations in execution time and memory consumption. For example, switching from a high-level language to a low-level language like C or assembly can greatly improve performance due to closer hardware interaction and better control over memory management."
