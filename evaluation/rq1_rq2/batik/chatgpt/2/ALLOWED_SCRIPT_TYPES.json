    "Reason": "The configuration option ALLOWED_SCRIPT_TYPES in the batik software project is performance-sensitive because changing the allowed script types can impact the security and performance of the system. Allowing certain script types may introduce vulnerabilities that could affect the system's performance, such as increasing the risk of malicious code execution or slowing down script processing. Therefore, any changes to this configuration option should be carefully evaluated to ensure optimal system performance."
