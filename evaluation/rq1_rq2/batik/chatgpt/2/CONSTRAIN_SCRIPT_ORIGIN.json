    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option CONSTRAIN_SCRIPT_ORIGIN in the batik software project is performance-sensitive because changing its value significantly impacts the security and performance of the system. When CONSTRAIN_SCRIPT_ORIGIN is enabled, it restricts scripts to only be loaded from the same origin as the document, which can improve security but may also affect the performance of script execution. Disabling this option may lead to potential security vulnerabilities but could also improve performance by allowing scripts from different origins to be loaded."
