    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The EXECUTE_ONLOAD configuration option in the batik software project is performance-sensitive because changing its value can significantly impact system performance. When set to true, the software will execute certain tasks on page load, potentially increasing execution time and memory consumption. On the other hand, setting it to false can reduce the load on the system and improve performance. Therefore, the value of this configuration option has a notable effect on system performance, making it performance-sensitive."
