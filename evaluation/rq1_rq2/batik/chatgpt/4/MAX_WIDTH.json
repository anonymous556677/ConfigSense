    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The MAX_WIDTH configuration in the batik software project is performance-sensitive because changing its value can significantly impact system performance. A higher MAX_WIDTH value may lead to increased memory consumption and longer execution times, especially when processing large images or graphics. Conversely, a lower MAX_WIDTH value may improve performance by reducing resource usage and processing time. Therefore, any changes to the MAX_WIDTH configuration can have a noticeable effect on the overall performance of the system."
