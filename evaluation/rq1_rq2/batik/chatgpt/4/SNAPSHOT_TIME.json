    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The SNAPSHOT_TIME configuration option is performance-sensitive because changing its value can significantly impact system performance. This configuration determines how frequently the system takes snapshots, which can affect the overall execution time and memory consumption of the system. A shorter snapshot time may lead to more frequent snapshots, increasing memory usage and potentially slowing down the system. On the other hand, a longer snapshot time may reduce memory consumption but may also result in slower response times for certain operations that rely on recent snapshots. Therefore, any change in the SNAPSHOT_TIME value can have noticeable effects on system performance."
