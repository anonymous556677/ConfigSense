    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The AOI configuration option in the batik software project is performance-sensitive because changing its value significantly impacts the rendering time of vector graphics. A higher AOI value leads to more accurate rendering but also increases the computational complexity, resulting in longer execution times and higher memory consumption."
