    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The EXECUTE_ONLOAD configuration option in the batik software project is performance-sensitive because changing its value significantly affects system performance. When set to true, the system will execute certain tasks on load, which can increase execution time and memory consumption. On the other hand, setting it to false can improve performance by deferring these tasks until they are actually needed, reducing the overall system load."
