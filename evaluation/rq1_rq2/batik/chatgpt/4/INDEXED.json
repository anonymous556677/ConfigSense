    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option INDEXED in the batik software project is performance-sensitive because changing its value can significantly impact system performance. When the INDEXED configuration is set to a higher value, it may lead to increased memory consumption and longer execution times due to the larger data structures being indexed and searched. This can result in notable variations in system performance, making it a performance-sensitive configuration."
