    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option CONSTRAIN_SCRIPT_ORIGIN in the batik software project is performance-sensitive because changing its value can significantly impact the execution time of scripts. When CONSTRAIN_SCRIPT_ORIGIN is enabled, the system restricts the origin of scripts, which can lead to increased security measures but also potentially slower script execution. Therefore, any changes to this configuration can have notable variations in system performance, making it performance-sensitive."
