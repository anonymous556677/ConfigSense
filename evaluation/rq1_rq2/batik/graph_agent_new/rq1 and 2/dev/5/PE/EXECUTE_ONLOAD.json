    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'EXECUTE_ONLOAD' configuration option is classified as performance-sensitive. This is because setting the value to true can trigger the 'onload' event and execute associated scripts, which can have a significant impact on system performance. From the system level, executing scripts on 'onload' can be time-expensive and memory-expensive operations, leading to notable performance variations. Additionally, the configuration directly affects the behavior and performance of the system, making it performance-sensitive."
