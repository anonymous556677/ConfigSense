    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The HEIGHT configuration is considered performance-sensitive because it directly affects the size of the image being transcoded, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The configuration involves performance-related operations that are time-expensive, as it determines the height of the output image based on the specified height or calculated height from the document's dimensions. Any changes in the HEIGHT configuration can significantly impact the execution time and memory consumption during the transcoding process, making it a performance-sensitive configuration."
