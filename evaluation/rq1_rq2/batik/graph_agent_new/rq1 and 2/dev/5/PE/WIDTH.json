    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'WIDTH' is performance-sensitive because it directly affects the size of the output image, leading to notable performance variations at the system level. The code snippet related to the 'WIDTH' configuration involves calculations for image size based on the width setting, which can be time-expensive and memory-expensive operations. Therefore, any changes in the 'WIDTH' configuration can have a significant impact on the overall performance of the system."
