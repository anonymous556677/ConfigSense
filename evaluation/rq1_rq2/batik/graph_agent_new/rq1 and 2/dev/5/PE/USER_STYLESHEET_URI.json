    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'USER_STYLESHEET_URI' is not performance-sensitive. The developer's explanation indicates that this configuration simply retrieves a user stylesheet URI specified in the TranscodingHints or falls back to a default value. This operation is minimal and does not involve any time-expensive or memory-expensive operations that would lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Therefore, based on the provided information and code context, the configuration is classified as not performance-sensitive."
