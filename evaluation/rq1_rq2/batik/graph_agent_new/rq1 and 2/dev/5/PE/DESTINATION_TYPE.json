    "Reason": "The DESTINATION_TYPE configuration option does not directly involve any performance-related operations that are time-expensive or memory-expensive within its related code. While it has a significant impact on determining the type of destination for the conversion process and modifying the result filename, these operations are not causing notable performance variations at the system level. Therefore, the configuration is not considered performance-sensitive."
