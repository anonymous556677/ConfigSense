    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The 'ALLOWED_SCRIPT_TYPES' configuration option is not performance-sensitive. The configuration code is responsible for building a list of allowed values for the <script> element's type attribute based on the 'KEY_ALLOWED_SCRIPT_TYPES' configuration key. This operation is not time-expensive or memory-expensive within its related code, and it does not lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The impact of this configuration is more related to functionality and security rather than system performance."
