    "Reason": "The 'XML_PARSER_VALIDATING' configuration option does not directly and substantially affect system performance at the system level. The configuration is only used to determine whether the XML parser should be in validation mode or not, which does not lead to notable performance variations. The impact of this configuration is limited to the behavior of the XML parser and does not involve any time-extensive or memory-extensive operations within its related code."
