    "Reason": "The DEFAULT_FONT_FAMILY configuration option is not performance-sensitive. The configuration code simply returns the default font family, which does not involve any time-expensive or memory-expensive operations. Additionally, the impact of this configuration is limited to determining the default font family used throughout the system, which does not lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
