    "Reason": "The MAX_HEIGHT configuration does not directly and substantially affect system performance at the system level. It is primarily used to limit the height of an image to maintain consistency and prevent oversized images from affecting the layout. While it may involve some performance-related operations in adjusting the image height, these operations are not time-extensive or memory-extensive enough to cause notable performance variations at the system level."
