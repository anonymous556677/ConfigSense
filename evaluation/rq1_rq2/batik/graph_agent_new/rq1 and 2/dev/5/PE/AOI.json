    "Reason": "The 'AOI' configuration option does not directly and substantially affect system performance at the system level. Although it involves modifying the image size based on hints, the impact on performance is not significant enough to be considered performance-sensitive. The developer's explanation also indicates that the configuration is triggered based on specific hints and does not involve time-extensive or memory-extensive operations that would lead to notable performance variations."
