    "Reason": "The configuration option 'LANGUAGE' is not performance-sensitive. The developer's information indicates that the impact of this configuration is minimal as it simply returns the user language specified or defaults to English. The code snippet provided for the configuration does not involve any performance-related operations that are time-expensive or memory-expensive. Therefore, it does not lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
