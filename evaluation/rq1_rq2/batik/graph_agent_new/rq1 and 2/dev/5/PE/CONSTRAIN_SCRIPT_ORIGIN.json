    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The CONSTRAIN_SCRIPT_ORIGIN configuration option is performance-sensitive. This is because setting the configuration to true enforces stricter security measures by constraining the script origin, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The code related to this configuration involves operations that are time-expensive as it determines the level of security applied to scripts, impacting execution time and memory consumption significantly."
