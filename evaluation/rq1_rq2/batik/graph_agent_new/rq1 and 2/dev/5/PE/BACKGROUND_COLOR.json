    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The BACKGROUND_COLOR configuration option is not performance-sensitive based on the provided information. The developer mentions that the impact of this configuration on the system is minimal in terms of performance, as it simply involves setting the background color of the transcoded image. Additionally, the triggering frequency of the configuration is dependent on the presence of a specific key in the hints map, which means it may not always be activated. While the configuration could potentially impact memory usage and processing time with large images, it does not directly and substantially affect system performance at the system level to be classified as performance-sensitive."
