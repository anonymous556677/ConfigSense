    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'MEDIA' is not performance-sensitive. The developer's information indicates that the configuration simply retrieves CSS media from the hints object or falls back to the super class if not found. This operation is minimal and does not involve any time-expensive or memory-expensive operations that would lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Therefore, the configuration does not directly and substantially affect system performance, making it non-performance-sensitive."
