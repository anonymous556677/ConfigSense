    "Reason": "The 'QUALITY' configuration option is not performance-sensitive. Although it affects the quality and size of the image being written, it does not directly and substantially impact system performance at the system level. The code snippet provided by the developer indicates that the configuration only sets the quality value for the image being written based on the hints provided. This operation is not time-expensive or memory-expensive, and therefore does not lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
