    "Reason": "The SNAPSHOT_TIME configuration option is not performance-sensitive based on the provided information. The developer's explanation indicates that this configuration is used to specify a time value for taking a snapshot of the SVG document, which is a specific and targeted operation. It does not involve any time-expensive or memory-expensive operations that would lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Therefore, the configuration does not have a direct and substantial impact on system performance."
