    "Reason": "The 'INDEXED' configuration option is not performance-sensitive. Although it affects the way indexed images are handled in the code and can impact the size and quality of the output image, the code snippet provided does not indicate any time-expensive or memory-expensive operations that would lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The configuration is triggered based on the presence of a specific key in the PNGTranscoder hints, and the frequency of triggering depends on how often this key is set, rather than directly causing significant performance impacts."
