    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The DEFAULT_FONT_FAMILY configuration option is not performance-sensitive. The configuration code simply returns the default font family, which has minimal impact on system performance. The code does not involve any time-expensive or memory-expensive operations that would lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Therefore, the configuration can be classified as not performance-sensitive."
