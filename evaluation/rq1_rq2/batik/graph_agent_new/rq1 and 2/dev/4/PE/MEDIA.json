    "Reason": "The configuration option 'MEDIA' is not performance-sensitive. The developer's explanation indicates that the configuration simply retrieves the CSS media of the user agent, which has minimal impact on system performance. The code snippet provided does not contain any performance-intensive operations that would lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Therefore, the configuration can be classified as not performance-sensitive."
