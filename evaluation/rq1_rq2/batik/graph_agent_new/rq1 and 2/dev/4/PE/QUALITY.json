    "Reason": "The 'QUALITY' configuration option is not performance-sensitive based on the provided information. The configuration only affects the quality and size of the JPEG image being written in the writeImage method. It does not involve any time-expensive or memory-expensive operations that would lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The impact of this configuration is limited to the image quality and file size, and does not directly and substantially affect system performance."
