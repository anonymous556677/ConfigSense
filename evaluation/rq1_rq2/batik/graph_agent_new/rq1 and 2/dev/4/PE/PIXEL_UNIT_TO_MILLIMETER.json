    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The 'PIXEL_UNIT_TO_MILLIMETER' configuration option is not performance-sensitive. The configuration is used to retrieve a conversion factor for pixel to millimeter conversion, which does not involve any time-expensive or memory-expensive operations. The impact of this configuration is on the accuracy of the conversion, rather than on system performance. Therefore, it does not lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
