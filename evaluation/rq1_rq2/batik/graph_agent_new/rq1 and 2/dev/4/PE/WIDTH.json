    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'WIDTH' is considered performance-sensitive because it directly affects the size of the output image, leading to notable performance variations at the system level. Setting the width of the image involves calculations and conditions that contribute to execution time and memory consumption, making it time-expensive and memory-expensive. As the width of the image impacts the aspect ratio and overall dimensions of the transcoded image, any changes in the 'WIDTH' configuration can significantly affect system performance during the transcoding process."
