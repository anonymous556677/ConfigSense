    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'LANGUAGE' is not performance-sensitive. The code snippet provided by the developer indicates that the configuration is simply returning a user-specified language or falling back to a default language if not found in the TranscodingHints. This operation is not time-expensive or memory-expensive, and it does not lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The impact of this configuration is related to localization and user experience, rather than system performance."
