    "Reason": "The 'BACKGROUND_COLOR' configuration option does not directly and substantially affect system performance at the system level. While it may impact the visual appearance of the transcoded image and user experience, it does not involve any time-expensive or memory-expensive operations within its related code that lead to notable performance variations. Therefore, it is considered not performance-sensitive."
