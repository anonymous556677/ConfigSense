    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The 'AOI' configuration option does not directly involve any time-expensive or memory-expensive operations within its related code. It simply transforms the Area of Interest (AOI) into the image's coordinate system and adjusts the image size based on the specified AOI. The configuration does not lead to notable performance variations at the system level, as it does not have a substantial impact on system performance. Therefore, it is classified as not performance-sensitive."
