    "Reason": "The SNAPSHOT_TIME configuration option does not directly and substantially affect system performance at the system level. The developer's explanation indicates that this configuration is used to specify a time value for taking a snapshot of the document and setting the current time of the animation engine in the code. While this may impact how the document is displayed or animated at a specific time, it does not involve any performance-related operations that are time-expensive or memory-expensive. Therefore, the configuration is not considered performance-sensitive."
