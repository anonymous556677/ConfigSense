    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The 'CONSTRAIN_SCRIPT_ORIGIN' configuration option does not directly involve any time-expensive or memory-expensive operations within its related code. It simply determines whether to constrain the origin of a script based on the value of 'KEY_CONSTRAIN_SCRIPT_ORIGIN'. While the impact of this configuration on security is significant, it does not lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Therefore, it is not classified as performance-sensitive."
