    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The 'EXECUTE_ONLOAD' configuration option is not performance-sensitive based on the provided information. The developer's explanation indicates that this configuration is mainly used to determine if the document is dynamic and should trigger an 'onload' event. While this may impact the behavior of the document and associated scripts, it does not involve any time-expensive or memory-expensive operations that would lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Therefore, the configuration is considered to have a trivial performance impact and is not classified as performance-sensitive."
