    "Reason": "The 'ALLOWED_SCRIPT_TYPES' configuration option does not directly and substantially affect system performance at the system level. The code snippet provided by the developer simply builds a list of allowed script types based on the hints and splits the string by comma. This operation is not time-expensive or memory-expensive, and it does not lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Therefore, the configuration is not considered performance-sensitive."
