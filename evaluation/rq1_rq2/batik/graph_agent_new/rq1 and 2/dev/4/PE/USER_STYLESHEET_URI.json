    "Reason": "The USER_STYLESHEET_URI configuration option is not performance-sensitive. The developer's information indicates that this configuration only affects the user stylesheet URI used in transcoding operations. Since it does not involve any time-extensive or memory-extensive operations within its related code and does not lead to notable performance variations at the system level, it can be classified as non-performance-sensitive."
