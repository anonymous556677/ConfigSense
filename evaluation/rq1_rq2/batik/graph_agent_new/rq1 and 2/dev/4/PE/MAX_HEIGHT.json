    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The MAX_HEIGHT configuration option does not directly and substantially affect system performance at the system level. While it may involve some performance-related operations within its related code, such as adjusting the width and height of an image, these operations are not time-extensive or memory-extensive enough to lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Therefore, the configuration is not considered performance-sensitive."
