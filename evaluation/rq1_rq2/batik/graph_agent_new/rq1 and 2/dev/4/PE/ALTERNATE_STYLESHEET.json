    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The ALTERNATE_STYLESHEET configuration option is not performance-sensitive. The developer's explanation indicates that this configuration only affects the user agent's alternate style-sheet title, which has minimal impact on system performance. The code snippet provided also does not contain any performance-intensive operations that would lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Therefore, based on the provided information and code context, the configuration is classified as not performance-sensitive."
