    "Reason": "The configuration option 'ALLOWED_SCRIPT_TYPES' is not performance-sensitive. The developer's explanation indicates that this configuration is responsible for building a list of allowed values for the <script> element's type attribute based on the presence of the 'KEY_ALLOWED_SCRIPT_TYPES' key in the hints. The operation of checking and tokenizing values to build the list does not involve any time-expensive or memory-expensive operations that would lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Additionally, the impact of this configuration is more focused on functionality and security rather than performance."
