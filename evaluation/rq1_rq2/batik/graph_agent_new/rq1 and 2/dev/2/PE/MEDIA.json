    "Reason": "The MEDIA configuration option is not performance-sensitive based on the provided information. The configuration code only retrieves the CSS media of the user agent, which has a limited impact on system performance. The configuration does not involve any time-extensive or memory-extensive operations that would lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Therefore, it is classified as not performance-sensitive."
