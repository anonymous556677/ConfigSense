    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The configuration option PIXEL_UNIT_TO_MILLIMETER is not performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the configuration only retrieves a conversion factor from TranscodingHints and returns a default value if not specified. This operation is not time-expensive or memory-expensive and does not lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The configuration is only triggered when the getPixelUnitToMillimeter() method is called, which does not have a significant impact on system performance."
