    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The DEFAULT_FONT_FAMILY configuration option is not performance-sensitive. The configuration code only retrieves the default font family from a map of hints and falls back to the superclass method if the font family is not found. This operation is not time-expensive or memory-expensive within its related code. Additionally, the impact of changing the font family on the system's UI components is limited and does not lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
