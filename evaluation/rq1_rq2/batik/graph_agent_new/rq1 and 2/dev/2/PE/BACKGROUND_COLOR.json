    "Reason": "The BACKGROUND_COLOR configuration option does not directly and substantially affect system performance at the system level. It only impacts the visual appearance of the transcoded image by setting the background color, which does not lead to notable performance variations. The configuration-related code does not involve any time-expensive or memory-expensive operations that would significantly impact system performance."
