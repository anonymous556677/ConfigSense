    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The MAX_HEIGHT configuration option does not directly and substantially affect system performance at the system level. The developer's explanation indicates that the configuration is used to limit the height of an image and resize it if necessary, which does not involve any time-expensive or memory-expensive operations. Additionally, the impact of the configuration is focused on maintaining consistency in image sizes and layout, rather than causing notable performance variations. Therefore, based on the provided information and code context, the MAX_HEIGHT configuration is not classified as performance-sensitive."
