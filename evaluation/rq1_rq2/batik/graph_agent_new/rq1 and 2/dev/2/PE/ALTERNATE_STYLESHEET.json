    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The ALTERNATE_STYLESHEET configuration option is not performance-sensitive. The developer's information indicates that this configuration only affects the appearance of the user agent's style-sheet and does not have a significant impact on the overall system functionality. Additionally, the configuration code provided by the developer does not contain any performance-related operations that are time-expensive or memory-expensive. Therefore, the configuration is classified as not performance-sensitive."
