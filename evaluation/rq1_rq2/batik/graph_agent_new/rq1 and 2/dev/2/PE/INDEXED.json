    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The INDEXED configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly affects the system performance at the system level. The configuration involves performance-related operations such as adjusting the image using the IndexImage class based on the configuration value, which can lead to notable performance variations in terms of color palette and image quality. Additionally, the configuration is checked each time the writeImage() method is called with a PNGTranscoder instance, indicating a potentially time-expensive operation that can impact system performance."
