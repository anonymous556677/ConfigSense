    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'CONSTRAIN_SCRIPT_ORIGIN' is performance-sensitive. This is because setting it to true or false directly impacts the level of security applied to scripts, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. In the configuration-related code, the 'getScriptSecurity' method is triggered with the 'KEY_CONSTRAIN_SCRIPT_ORIGIN' hint, indicating that this configuration involves performance-related operations that are time-expensive. The decision to constrain or relax script origin can have significant implications on execution time and memory consumption, making it a performance-sensitive configuration."
