    "Reason": "The DESTINATION_TYPE configuration option is not performance-sensitive. Although it directly affects the type of output files generated during the conversion process, the impact on system performance is not substantial. The code snippet provided by the developer indicates that the configuration is mainly used to determine the file extension for the destination file, which is a relatively trivial operation in terms of performance. Additionally, the triggering frequency of the configuration depends on how often conversions are performed, which suggests that it does not involve time-extensive or memory-extensive operations that would lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
