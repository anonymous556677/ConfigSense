    "Reason": "The 'QUALITY' configuration option does not directly and substantially affect system performance at the system level. The developer's explanation indicates that the configuration only determines the quality of the image output based on a specified value or a default value. While the size of the image output may be impacted by the quality setting, it does not lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Additionally, the configuration is triggered only when the writeImage method is called, and the frequency of triggering depends on the usage of this method in the system. Overall, the 'QUALITY' configuration is more focused on image quality and size rather than performance optimization."
