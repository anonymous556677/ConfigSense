    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The 'SNAPSHOT_TIME' configuration option does not directly and substantially affect system performance at the system level. Although it is used to set the current time for the animation engine and may impact the timing and synchronization of animations in the SVG document, it does not involve any time-expensive or memory-expensive operations that lead to notable performance variations. The triggering frequency and size impact of the configuration also do not indicate any significant performance impact. Therefore, based on the provided information and code context, the 'SNAPSHOT_TIME' configuration is classified as not performance-sensitive."
