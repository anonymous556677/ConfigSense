    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'USER_STYLESHEET_URI' is not performance-sensitive based on the provided information. Although it is triggered whenever the getUserStyleSheetURI() method is called, the impact of this configuration is related to customization of stylesheets for transcoding, which may affect appearance and layout but does not directly lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The developer's explanation also indicates that if the stylesheet URI is not specified, the default behavior defined in the superclass method will be used, which suggests that the performance impact is not substantial."
