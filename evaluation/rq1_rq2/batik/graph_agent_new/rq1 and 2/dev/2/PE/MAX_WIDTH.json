    "Reason": "The MAX_WIDTH configuration option does not directly involve any performance-related operations that are time-expensive or memory-expensive within its related code. It simply checks and adjusts the width of an image to ensure it does not exceed a specified maximum width. This operation is not likely to cause notable performance variations at the system level, as it is a straightforward check and adjustment process that is not resource-intensive."
