    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'AOI' configuration option is performance-sensitive. From the system level perspective, the 'AOI' configuration directly impacts the image transformation process by applying scaling and translation matrices, which can lead to notable performance variations in terms of execution time and memory consumption. Additionally, the 'AOI' configuration involves modifying the image size based on the specified AOI, which can be time-expensive and memory-expensive operations within the related code, further contributing to its performance sensitivity."
