    "Reason": "The configuration option 'LANGUAGE' is not performance-sensitive. The developer's information indicates that the impact of this configuration is minimal as it simply returns the language specified in the TranscodingHints or defaults to English. The code snippet related to this configuration does not involve any time-expensive or memory-expensive operations that would lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Therefore, the configuration can be classified as not performance-sensitive."
