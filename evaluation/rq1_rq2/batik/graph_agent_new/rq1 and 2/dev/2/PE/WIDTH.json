    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The WIDTH configuration option is considered performance-sensitive. This is because setting the width of the output image directly affects the size of the image, leading to potential memory-expensive operations when adjusting the height proportionally to maintain the aspect ratio. This can result in notable performance variations at the system level, making the configuration performance-sensitive."
