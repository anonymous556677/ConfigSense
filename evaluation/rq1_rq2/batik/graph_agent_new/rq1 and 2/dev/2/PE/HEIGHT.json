    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The HEIGHT configuration option is considered performance-sensitive. This is because the height of the image being transcoded directly impacts the size of the image, which can have a significant effect on the overall appearance and scaling. Additionally, the HEIGHT configuration is used to compute the preserveAspectRatio matrix, which can contribute to time-expensive operations during the transcoding process. These performance-related operations at the code level can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, making the HEIGHT configuration performance-sensitive."
