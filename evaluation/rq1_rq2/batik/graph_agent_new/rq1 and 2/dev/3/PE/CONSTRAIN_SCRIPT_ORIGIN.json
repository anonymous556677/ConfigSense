    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The CONSTRAIN_SCRIPT_ORIGIN configuration option does not directly involve any performance-related operations that are time-expensive or memory-expensive within its related code. While it may have a significant impact on system security settings, it does not lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Therefore, it is not classified as performance-sensitive."
