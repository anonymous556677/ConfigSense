    "Reason": "The 'QUALITY' configuration option is not performance-sensitive based on the provided information. The configuration code related to setting the quality of the output image does not involve any time-expensive or memory-expensive operations that would lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The impact of the configuration option is primarily on the quality of the output image and file size, rather than on system performance. Therefore, it can be classified as not performance-sensitive."
