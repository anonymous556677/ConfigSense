    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The MAX_HEIGHT configuration option does not directly and substantially affect system performance at the system level. The developer's explanation indicates that the configuration is mainly used to limit the height of an image and ensure consistency in layout. While resizing images based on the MAX_HEIGHT value may involve some performance-related operations, such operations are not time-expensive or memory-expensive enough to cause notable performance variations at the system level. Therefore, the configuration is not considered performance-sensitive."
