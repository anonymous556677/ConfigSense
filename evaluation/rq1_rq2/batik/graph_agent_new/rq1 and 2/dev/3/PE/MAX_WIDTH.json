    "Reason": "The MAX_WIDTH configuration option does not directly involve any performance-related operations that are time-expensive or memory-expensive within its related code. It simply checks and adjusts the width of an image, which is a trivial operation and does not lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Therefore, the configuration is not considered performance-sensitive."
