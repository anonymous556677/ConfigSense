    "Reason": "The configuration option 'USER_STYLESHEET_URI' is not performance-sensitive. The developer's information indicates that this configuration simply retrieves a user stylesheet URI and does not have a significant impact on the system. The code related to this configuration does not involve any time-expensive or memory-expensive operations that would lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Therefore, it can be classified as not performance-sensitive."
