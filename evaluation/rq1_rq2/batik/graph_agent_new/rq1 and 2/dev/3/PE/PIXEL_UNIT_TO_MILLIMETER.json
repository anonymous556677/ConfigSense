    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The configuration option PIXEL_UNIT_TO_MILLIMETER is not performance-sensitive. The developer's information indicates that this configuration retrieves a conversion factor and is triggered only when the getPixelUnitToMillimeter() method is called. This configuration does not involve any time-expensive or memory-expensive operations within its related code. Additionally, the impact of this configuration on system performance is minimal as it mainly affects the rendering and scaling of graphics, which are not critical performance factors at the system level."
