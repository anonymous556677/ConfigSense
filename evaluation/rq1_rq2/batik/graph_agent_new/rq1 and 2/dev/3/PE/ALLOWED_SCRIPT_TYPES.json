    "Reason": "The configuration option 'ALLOWED_SCRIPT_TYPES' does not directly and substantially affect system performance at the system level. The developer's information indicates that this configuration is used to define the allowed values for the <script> element's type attribute, and it is triggered only when a specific key is present in the hints map. The impact of this configuration is mainly related to security by restricting the types of scripts that can be used, rather than causing notable performance variations. Additionally, the code snippet provided shows that the method returns without building the list of allowed script types if the key is not present, indicating that the performance impact is minimal."
