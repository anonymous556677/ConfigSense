    "Reason": "The DEFAULT_FONT_FAMILY configuration option is not performance-sensitive based on the provided information. The configuration only impacts the font family used in the system, which has a limited impact on the overall performance. The code snippet provided by the developer also does not involve any performance-intensive operations that would lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Therefore, the configuration can be classified as not performance-sensitive."
