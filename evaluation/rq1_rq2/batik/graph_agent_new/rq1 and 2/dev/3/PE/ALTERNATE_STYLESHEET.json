    "Reason": "The ALTERNATE_STYLESHEET configuration option is not performance-sensitive. The developer's information indicates that this configuration only affects the alternate style-sheet title functionality and does not have a significant impact on overall system performance. The code snippet provided also shows that the configuration method simply retrieves the alternate style-sheet title from a map or falls back to a super class method, which does not involve any time-expensive or memory-expensive operations that would lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
