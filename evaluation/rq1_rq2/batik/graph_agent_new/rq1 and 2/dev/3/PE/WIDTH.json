    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'WIDTH' is performance-sensitive because it directly affects the size and dimensions of the output image, leading to notable performance variations at the system level. The 'WIDTH' configuration is used in various calculations within the code to determine the output image size, making it a time-expensive operation. Additionally, adjusting the width value can impact the visual representation and quality of the transcoded image, further emphasizing its performance sensitivity."
