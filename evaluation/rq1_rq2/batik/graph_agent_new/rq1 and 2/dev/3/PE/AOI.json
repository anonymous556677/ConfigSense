    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The 'AOI' configuration option does not directly and substantially affect system performance at the system level. Although it may impact the final output image size and quality, it does not involve any time-extensive or memory-extensive operations within its related code that lead to notable performance variations. Therefore, it is classified as not performance-sensitive."
