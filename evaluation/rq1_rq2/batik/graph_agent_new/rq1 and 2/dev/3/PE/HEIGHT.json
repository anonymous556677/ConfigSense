    "Reason": "The HEIGHT configuration option is not performance-sensitive based on the provided information. Although it directly impacts the height of the output image during transcoding, it does not involve any time-expensive or memory-expensive operations within its related code. The configuration is triggered only when the transcode method is called, and its impact is limited to determining the height of the image. Since it does not lead to notable performance variations at the system level and does not involve any significant performance-related operations, it is classified as not performance-sensitive."
