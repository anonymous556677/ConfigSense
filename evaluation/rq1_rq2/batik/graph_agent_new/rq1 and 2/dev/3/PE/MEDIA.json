    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'MEDIA' is not performance-sensitive. The developer's explanation indicates that the configuration code is a method that simply retrieves the CSS media value of the user agent. This operation is minimal and does not involve any time-expensive or memory-expensive operations. Additionally, the configuration is only triggered when the getMedia() method is called, which suggests that it does not have a significant impact on system performance. Therefore, based on the provided information and code context, the 'MEDIA' configuration is classified as not performance-sensitive."
