    "Reason": "The 'SNAPSHOT_TIME' configuration option is not performance-sensitive. Although it affects the rendering of the SVG document at a specific time and allows capturing a snapshot of the animation, it does not directly and substantially impact system performance at the system level. The developer's information indicates that the configuration is triggered based on specific conditions and is used for animation purposes, which are not time-expensive or memory-expensive operations that would lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
