    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'EXECUTE_ONLOAD' configuration option is classified as performance-sensitive. This is because setting the configuration to true triggers the 'onload' event and processes dynamic content in the SVG document, which can have a significant impact on system performance. The execution of dynamic content and scripts can be time-expensive and memory-expensive, leading to notable performance variations at the system level. Therefore, this configuration directly and substantially affects system performance, making it performance-sensitive."
