    "Reason": "The BACKGROUND_COLOR configuration option does not directly and substantially affect system performance at the system level. It mainly impacts the visual appearance of the transcoded image by setting the background color, which may affect user experience and visual presentation but does not lead to notable performance variations. Additionally, the developer's information indicates that the configuration is triggered when the transcoding process is initiated for a document, and the frequency of triggering depends on document transcoding frequency, which suggests that it does not involve time-extensive or memory-extensive operations that would significantly impact performance."
