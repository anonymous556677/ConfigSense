The code snippet provided shows that the configuration value is fetched from the 'hints' map using the key 'KEY_ALTERNATE_STYLESHEET'. If the value is not found in the 'hints' map, the method falls back to the super class method to retrieve the alternate style-sheet title.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The triggering frequency of the 'ALTERNATE_STYLESHEET' configuration depends on when the getAlternateStyleSheet() method is called in the code. If this method is called frequently in the application, then the configuration will be triggered accordingly.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the 'ALTERNATE_STYLESHEET' configuration option on the system is minimal as it only involves retrieving a string value from a map. This configuration does not seem to have a significant impact on the overall system performance or behavior."
