    "Reason": "The BACKGROUND_COLOR configuration option is not performance-sensitive based on the provided information. The configuration only affects the visual appearance of the transcoded image by setting the background color, which is a trivial impact on performance. There are no performance-related operations within the configuration code that contribute significantly to execution time or memory consumption at the system level. Therefore, it does not lead to notable performance variations and should not be considered performance-sensitive."
