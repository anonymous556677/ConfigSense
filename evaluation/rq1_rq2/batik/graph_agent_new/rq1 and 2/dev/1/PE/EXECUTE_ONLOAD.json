    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The 'EXECUTE_ONLOAD' configuration option, as described by the developer, is used to determine if an 'onload' event needs to be dispatched during the transcoding process of an SVG document. While this configuration may impact the behavior of the document being transcoded, it does not directly and substantially affect system performance at the system level. The configuration does not involve any performance-related operations that are time-extensive or memory-extensive within its related code, and therefore does not lead to notable performance variations. As a result, the 'EXECUTE_ONLOAD' configuration option is not considered performance-sensitive."
