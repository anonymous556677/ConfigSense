    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'CONSTRAIN_SCRIPT_ORIGIN' does not directly involve any performance-related operations that are time-expensive or memory-expensive within its related code. It simply determines whether to constrain the origin of a script or not, which does not lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Therefore, it is classified as not performance-sensitive."
