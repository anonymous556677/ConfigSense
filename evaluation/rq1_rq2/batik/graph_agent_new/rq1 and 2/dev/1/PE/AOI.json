    "Reason": "The 'AOI' configuration option does not directly and substantially affect system performance at the system level. The developer's explanation indicates that the configuration is used to define an Area of Interest in the SVG document and adjust the image based on the specified AOI. Although it may impact the final output size and appearance of the image, it does not involve any performance-sensitive operations that would lead to notable performance variations. Therefore, the configuration is not considered performance-sensitive."
