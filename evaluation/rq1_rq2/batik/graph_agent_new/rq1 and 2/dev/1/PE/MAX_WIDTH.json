    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The MAX_WIDTH configuration option does not directly and substantially affect system performance at the system level. Although it involves some performance-related operations within its related code, such as checking and adjusting image width, these operations are not time-extensive or memory-extensive enough to lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Therefore, the configuration is not considered performance-sensitive."
