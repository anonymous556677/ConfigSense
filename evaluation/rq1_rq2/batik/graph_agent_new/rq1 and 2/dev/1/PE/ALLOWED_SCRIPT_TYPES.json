    "Reason": "The configuration option 'ALLOWED_SCRIPT_TYPES' is not performance-sensitive. The developer's explanation indicates that this configuration is primarily focused on security by restricting the types of scripts that can be processed by the system. While it may impact the functionality of the system, it does not involve any performance-related operations that are time-expensive or memory-expensive. The configuration is triggered only when processing <script> elements and does not lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
