    "Reason": "The WIDTH configuration option is not performance-sensitive. Although it directly affects the size of the output image and can impact the overall layout and quality, it does not involve any performance-related operations that are time-expensive or memory-expensive within its related code. The developer's information also indicates that the triggering frequency of the WIDTH configuration depends on when the transcode method is called with the configuration, rather than causing notable performance variations at the system level."
