    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'HEIGHT' is performance-sensitive. This is because the 'HEIGHT' configuration directly impacts the size of the image being transcoded, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The code snippet that retrieves the 'HEIGHT' from hints and calculates the size of the image based on it is time-expensive and memory-expensive, contributing significantly to the execution time and memory consumption. Therefore, any changes in the 'HEIGHT' configuration can have a substantial effect on the system performance."
