    "Reason": "The INDEXED configuration option does not directly and substantially affect system performance at the system level. Although it may impact the size of the image by converting it to an indexed image with a limited color palette, this impact is not significant enough to cause notable performance variations. The configuration-related code snippet provided by the developer also does not contain any performance-intensive operations that would classify it as performance-sensitive."
