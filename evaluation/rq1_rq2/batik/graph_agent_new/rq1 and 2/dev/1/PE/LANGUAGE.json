    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'LANGUAGE' is not performance-sensitive. The code snippet provided by the developer indicates that the configuration simply returns a language value based on the hints provided or defaults to english if none is specified. This operation is minimal and does not involve any time-expensive or memory-expensive operations that would lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Therefore, the configuration does not directly and substantially affect system performance, and the impact is considered trivial."
