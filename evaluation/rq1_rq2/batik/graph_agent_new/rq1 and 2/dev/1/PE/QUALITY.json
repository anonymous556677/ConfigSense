    "Reason": "The 'QUALITY' configuration option is not performance-sensitive based on the provided information. The configuration mainly focuses on setting the quality of the image being written to the output, which does not directly and substantially affect system performance at the system level. The impact of the configuration is more on the size and quality of the image, rather than causing notable performance variations. The code snippet provided by the developer also indicates that the configuration is straightforward and does not involve any time-expensive or memory-expensive operations that would lead to significant performance impacts."
