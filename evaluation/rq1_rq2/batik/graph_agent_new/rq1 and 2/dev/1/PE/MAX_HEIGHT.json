    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The MAX_HEIGHT configuration option does not directly and substantially affect system performance at the system level. The developer's explanation indicates that the configuration is used to limit the height of an image and resize it if necessary, which is a common operation in image processing. While resizing images may have some performance impact, it is not considered time-expensive or memory-expensive enough to cause notable performance variations at the system level. Therefore, the MAX_HEIGHT configuration is not classified as performance-sensitive."
