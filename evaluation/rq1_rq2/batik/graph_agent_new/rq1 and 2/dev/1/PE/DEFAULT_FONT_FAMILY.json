    "Reason": "The DEFAULT_FONT_FAMILY configuration option is not performance-sensitive. The developer's information indicates that this configuration only affects the default font family used in the system, and changing it may impact the application's look and feel. However, there is no indication that this configuration directly and substantially affects system performance at the system level or involves any time-expensive or memory-expensive operations within its related code. Therefore, it is classified as not performance-sensitive."
