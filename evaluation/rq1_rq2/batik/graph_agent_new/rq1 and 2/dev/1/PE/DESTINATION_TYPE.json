    "Reason": "The 'DESTINATION_TYPE' configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the type of destination file created during the conversion process, which can lead to significant variations in performance at the system level. The configuration involves selecting the transcoder and modifying the result filename, which are time-expensive operations. These performance-related operations within the configuration code can have a notable impact on system performance, making it performance-sensitive."
