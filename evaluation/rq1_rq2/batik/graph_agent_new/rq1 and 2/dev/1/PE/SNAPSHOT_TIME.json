    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The 'SNAPSHOT_TIME' configuration option is not performance-sensitive based on the provided information. Although it controls the timing of animations in the SVG document, it does not directly and substantially affect system performance at the system level. The configuration does not involve any time-expensive or memory-expensive operations within its related code that would lead to notable performance variations. Additionally, the triggering frequency and size impact of the configuration do not indicate significant performance implications."
