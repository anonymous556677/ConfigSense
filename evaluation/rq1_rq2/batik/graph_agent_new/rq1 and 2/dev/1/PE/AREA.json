    "Reason": "The 'AREA' configuration option does not directly and substantially affect system performance at the system level. Although it involves some performance-related operations related to setting the document size based on hints, the impact on performance is not significant enough to cause notable performance variations. The configuration is triggered when the 'setImageSize' method is called, but the modifications made to the width and height based on the 'KEY_SCALE_TO_PAGE' hint do not lead to time-extensive or memory-extensive operations that would significantly impact system performance."
