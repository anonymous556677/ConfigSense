    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The 'ALTERNATE_STYLESHEET' configuration option is not performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the configuration involves retrieving a string value from a map, which does not have a significant impact on the overall system performance. The code snippet provided by the developer also indicates that the configuration does not involve any time-expensive or memory-expensive operations that would lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
