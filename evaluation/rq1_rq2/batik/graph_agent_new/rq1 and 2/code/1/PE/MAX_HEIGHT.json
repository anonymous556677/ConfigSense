    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option MAX_HEIGHT is performance-sensitive. The code snippet provided shows that the MAX_HEIGHT configuration directly affects the image size computation, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The MAX_HEIGHT configuration involves time-expensive operations that impact the execution time and memory consumption within the setImageSize method. Limiting the image size based on the MAX_HEIGHT hint can significantly affect the overall performance of the system, making it a performance-sensitive configuration."
