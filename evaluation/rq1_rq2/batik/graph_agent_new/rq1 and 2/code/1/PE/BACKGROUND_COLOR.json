    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The configuration option BACKGROUND_COLOR is not performance-sensitive based on the provided code context. The code snippet related to the configuration involves setting the background color for an image, which is a trivial operation and does not have a significant impact on system performance at the system level. The configuration-related code does not contain any time-expensive or memory-expensive operations that would lead to notable performance variations. Therefore, the configuration is not classified as performance-sensitive."
