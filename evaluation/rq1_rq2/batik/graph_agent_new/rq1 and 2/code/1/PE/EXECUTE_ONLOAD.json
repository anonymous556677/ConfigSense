    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option EXECUTE_ONLOAD is performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration involves time-expensive and memory-expensive operations within its related code, such as building the GVT tree, dispatching an 'onload' event, and computing the preserveAspectRatio matrix. These operations directly and substantially affect system performance at the system level, leading to notable performance variations. Additionally, the presence of the flag KEY_EXECUTE_ONLOAD indicates that the configuration can have a significant impact on performance."
