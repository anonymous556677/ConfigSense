    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option MAX_WIDTH is performance-sensitive. This is because the MAX_WIDTH configuration directly affects the image size computation within the setImageSize method. The code snippet related to MAX_WIDTH involves time-expensive operations that limit the image size based on the maximum width hints. This can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, making it a performance-sensitive configuration."
