    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'QUALITY' is performance-sensitive. The code context provided shows that the 'QUALITY' configuration directly affects the JPEG image quality by setting the quality parameter for image encoding. This parameter can have a significant impact on the execution time and memory consumption of the system, as it determines the level of compression applied to the image. Changes in image quality can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, making this configuration performance-sensitive."
