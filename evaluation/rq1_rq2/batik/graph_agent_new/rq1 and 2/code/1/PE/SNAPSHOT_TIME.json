    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'SNAPSHOT_TIME' is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the 'KEY_SNAPSHOT_TIME' configuration involves time-expensive operations within the related code. The code snippet mentions that if the 'KEY_SNAPSHOT_TIME' is present in the hints, it will set the current time for the animation engine, which can have a notable performance impact at the system level. This direct involvement in setting the current time for animations can lead to significant performance variations, making it a performance-sensitive configuration."
