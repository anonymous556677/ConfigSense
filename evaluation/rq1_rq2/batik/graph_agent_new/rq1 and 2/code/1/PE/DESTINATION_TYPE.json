    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option DESTINATION_TYPE is performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly affects the system performance at the system level by determining the transcoder to use for the operation, which can have a significant impact on the execution time and memory consumption. The code snippets related to the configuration involve time-expensive and memory-expensive operations, such as computing transcoding hints and converting files one by one, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
