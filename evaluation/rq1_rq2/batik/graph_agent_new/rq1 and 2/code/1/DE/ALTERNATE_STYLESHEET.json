The code snippet provided shows that the method getAlternateStyleSheet() checks if the alternate style-sheet title is present in the hints map. If it is present, it returns the title, otherwise it falls back to the super class method.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The triggering frequency of the 'ALTERNATE_STYLESHEET' configuration depends on when the method getAlternateStyleSheet() is called in the code. If this method is called frequently in the application, then the configuration will be triggered accordingly.",
