    "Reason": "The configuration option 'HEIGHT' is not performance-sensitive. The code related to the 'HEIGHT' configuration does not contain any performance-sensitive operations that significantly impact system performance. The operations related to setting the image size and handling width and height calculations are standard and do not lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
