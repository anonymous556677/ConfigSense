    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option DESTINATION_TYPE is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the DESTINATION_TYPE configuration directly affects the system performance at the system level. The code snippets related to DESTINATION_TYPE involve time-expensive operations such as computing transcoding hints, creating output directories, and transcoding files one by one. These operations contribute significantly to execution time and memory consumption, leading to notable performance variations at the system level."
