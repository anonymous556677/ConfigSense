    "Reason": "The configuration option ALLOWED_SCRIPT_TYPES is not performance-sensitive. The code snippet provided is a helper method that builds a Vector containing the allowed values for the <script> element's type attribute. This operation does not involve any time-expensive or memory-expensive operations that would lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The configuration-related code is simply parsing a string and adding tokens to a list, which is not significant enough to classify the configuration as performance-sensitive."
