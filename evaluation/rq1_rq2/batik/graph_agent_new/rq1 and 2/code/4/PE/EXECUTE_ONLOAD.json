    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option EXECUTE_ONLOAD is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the configuration involves time-expensive and memory-expensive operations within its related code. The code snippet provided shows that the configuration directly affects system performance at the system level by building the GVT tree, dispatching onload events, and computing the preserveAspectRatio matrix. These operations contribute significantly to execution time and memory consumption, leading to notable performance variations at the system level."
