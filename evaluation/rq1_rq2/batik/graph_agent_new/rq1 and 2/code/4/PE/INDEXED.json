    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'INDEXED' is not performance-sensitive. Although the code snippet involves some performance-related operations like image encoding and setting parameters, these operations do not lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The configuration-related code focuses on handling indexed images and setting image parameters, which are not time-expensive or memory-expensive enough to have a significant impact on system performance."
