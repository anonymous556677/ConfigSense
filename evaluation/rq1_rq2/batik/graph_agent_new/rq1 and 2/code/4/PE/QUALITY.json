    "Reason": "The configuration option 'QUALITY' is performance-sensitive. The 'QUALITY' configuration directly affects the performance of the system at the system level by setting the JPEG quality of the image being written. The code snippet provided shows that the quality parameter is retrieved from hints and used to set the JPEG quality, which can have a significant impact on the execution time and memory consumption of the system. Therefore, the 'QUALITY' configuration is considered performance-sensitive."
