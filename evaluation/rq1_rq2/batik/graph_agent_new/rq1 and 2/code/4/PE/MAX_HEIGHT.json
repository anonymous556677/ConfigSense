    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option MAX_HEIGHT is performance-sensitive. The code snippet provided shows that the MAX_HEIGHT configuration directly affects the image size computation, which can have a significant impact on the system's performance. If the image height exceeds the MAX_HEIGHT hint, the width and height calculations are adjusted accordingly, potentially leading to notable performance variations. Therefore, MAX_HEIGHT configuration involves performance-related operations that are time-expensive within its related code and can directly and substantially affect system performance at the system level."
