    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'SNAPSHOT_TIME' is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the 'KEY_SNAPSHOT_TIME' configuration involves time-extensive operations within the related code. The code snippet related to 'KEY_SNAPSHOT_TIME' directly affects the system performance by setting the current time for the animation engine, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Additionally, the 'KEY_SNAPSHOT_TIME' configuration is crucial for dynamic document handling and can significantly impact the execution time and memory consumption of the system."
