    "Reason": "The configuration option BACKGROUND_COLOR is not performance-sensitive. The code snippet related to this configuration involves setting the background color of an image, which is a trivial operation and does not have a significant impact on system performance. The code does not contain any time-expensive or memory-expensive operations that would lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
