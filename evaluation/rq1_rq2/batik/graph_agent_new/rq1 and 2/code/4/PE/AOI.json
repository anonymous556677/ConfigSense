    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'AOI' is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the 'AOI' configuration involves performance-related operations that are time-expensive within its related code. The 'AOI' configuration directly affects system performance at the system level by performing operations such as deep cloning documents, building the GVT tree, and computing the preserveAspectRatio matrix. These operations contribute significantly to execution time and memory consumption, leading to notable performance variations at the system level."
