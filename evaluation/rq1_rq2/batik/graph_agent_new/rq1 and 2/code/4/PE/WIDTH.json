    "Reason": "The configuration option 'WIDTH' is not performance-sensitive. Although the code snippet involves operations related to setting width and height for image transcoding, these operations do not directly and substantially affect system performance at the system level. The code snippet mainly deals with image size calculations and transformations, which are not time-expensive or memory-expensive operations leading to notable performance variations."
