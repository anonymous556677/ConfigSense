    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option MAX_WIDTH is performance-sensitive. This is because the MAX_WIDTH configuration directly affects the image size computation within the setImageSize method, which is a performance-related operation. Depending on the value of MAX_WIDTH, the width and height of the image are adjusted accordingly, leading to notable performance variations at the system level. The MAX_WIDTH configuration involves time-expensive operations that significantly impact the performance of the system."
