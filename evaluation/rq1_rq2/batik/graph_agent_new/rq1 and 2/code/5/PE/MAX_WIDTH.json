    "Reason": "The configuration option MAX_WIDTH is not performance-sensitive. The code snippet related to MAX_WIDTH involves simple arithmetic operations to limit the image size based on the maximum width hint. These operations do not have a significant impact on system performance at the system level. The configuration-related code does not contain any time-expensive or memory-expensive operations that would lead to notable performance variations."
