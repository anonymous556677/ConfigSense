    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option DESTINATION_TYPE is performance-sensitive. This is because the code context provided shows that the configuration directly affects the system performance at the system level. The method getDestinationFile() modifies the result filename based on the destination type, which involves time-expensive string manipulation operations. Additionally, the configuration is used in multiple places within the code to determine the destination file and transcoder to use, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
