    "Reason": "The CONSTRAIN_SCRIPT_ORIGIN configuration option does not directly involve any performance-related operations that are time-expensive or memory-expensive within its related code.

This decision does not lead to notable performance variations at the system level, making it a non-performance-sensitive configuration."
