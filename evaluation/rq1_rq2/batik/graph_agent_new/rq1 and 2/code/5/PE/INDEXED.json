    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'INDEXED' is performance-sensitive. This is because the code snippet related to the 'INDEXED' configuration involves operations that directly impact system performance. Specifically, the code snippet checks for the presence of 'KEY_INDEXED' in the hints, performs calculations based on the value of 'n', and manipulates the 'img' object accordingly. These operations are time-expensive and memory-expensive, leading to notable performance variations at the system level."
