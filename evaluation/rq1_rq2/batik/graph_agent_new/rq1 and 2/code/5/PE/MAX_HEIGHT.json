    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The configuration option MAX_HEIGHT is not performance-sensitive. The code snippet provided does not contain any performance-related operations that significantly impact system performance at the system level. The MAX_HEIGHT configuration is used to limit the image height, but the calculations involved are not time-expensive or memory-expensive, and they do not lead to notable performance variations. Therefore, the MAX_HEIGHT configuration can be classified as not performance-sensitive."
