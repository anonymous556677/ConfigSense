{
    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option EXECUTE_ONLOAD is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the code snippet related to this configuration involves time-expensive and memory-expensive operations that directly and substantially affect system performance at the system level. Specifically, the configuration involves building the GVT tree, dispatching an 'onload' event, and computing the preserveAspectRatio matrix, which are all operations that contribute significantly to execution time and memory consumption. Additionally, the configuration includes dynamic state handling and script loading, which further emphasize its performance sensitivity."
