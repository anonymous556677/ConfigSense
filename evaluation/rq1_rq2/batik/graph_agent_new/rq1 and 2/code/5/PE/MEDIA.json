    "Reason": "The configuration option 'MEDIA' does not involve any performance-related operations that are time-expensive or memory-expensive within its related code. The code snippet provided simply retrieves a value from hints and falls back to a superclass method if the value is null, which does not lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Therefore, the configuration 'MEDIA' is not considered performance-sensitive."
