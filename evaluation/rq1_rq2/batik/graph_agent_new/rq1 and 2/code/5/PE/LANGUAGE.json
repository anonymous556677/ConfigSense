    "Reason": "The 'LANGUAGE' configuration option is not performance-sensitive. The code snippet provided is a simple method that returns the user language specified in the TranscodingHints or defaults to 'en' (english) if none is specified. This method does not involve any time-expensive or memory-expensive operations that would lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Therefore, this configuration can be considered trivial in terms of performance impact."
