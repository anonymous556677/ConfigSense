    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option BACKGROUND_COLOR is performance-sensitive. This is because the code snippet related to this configuration involves time-expensive and memory-expensive operations. Specifically, setting the background color involves painting the image with the specified background color, which can have a notable performance impact at the system level. Additionally, the configuration directly affects the rendering process of the image, which is a critical operation for system performance."
