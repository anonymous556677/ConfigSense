    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'AOI' is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the 'AOI' configuration involves performance-related operations that are time-expensive within its related code. The 'AOI' configuration directly affects system performance at the system level by performing calculations that involve scaling and transforming the image based on the specified Area of Interest (AOI). These operations contribute significantly to execution time and memory consumption, leading to notable performance variations at the system level."
