    "Reason": "The configuration option USER_STYLESHEET_URI is not performance-sensitive. The code snippet provided does not contain any performance-related operations that are time-expensive or memory-expensive. The configuration only retrieves a value from TranscodingHints and returns it, which is a simple operation that is unlikely to cause notable performance variations at the system level."
