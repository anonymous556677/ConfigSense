    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The configuration 'QUALITY' is used in the code to determine the quality of the JPEG image being written. It checks if the hints contain a key 'KEY_QUALITY', and if it does, it uses that value as the quality, otherwise it sets a default quality of 0.75f. The quality value is then used to set the JPEG quality in the ImageWriterParams.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The configuration is triggered whenever the writeImage method is called to write an image to an output. The frequency of triggering depends on how often the writeImage method is invoked in the system.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the 'QUALITY' configuration option is on the size and quality of the JPEG image being written. A higher quality value will result in a larger file size and better image quality, while a lower quality value will result in a smaller file size but lower image quality."
