    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option MAX_HEIGHT is performance-sensitive. The code snippet provided shows that the MAX_HEIGHT configuration directly affects the image size calculation within the setImageSize method. Depending on the value of MAX_HEIGHT, the width and height of the image are adjusted accordingly, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. If MAX_HEIGHT is set to a very large value, it can result in time-expensive operations that significantly impact the execution time and memory consumption of the system."
