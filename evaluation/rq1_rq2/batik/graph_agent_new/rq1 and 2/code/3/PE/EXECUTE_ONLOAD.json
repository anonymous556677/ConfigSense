    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option EXECUTE_ONLOAD is performance-sensitive. This is because the code snippet related to this configuration involves time-expensive and memory-expensive operations such as building the GVT tree, dispatching an 'onload' event, and computing the preserveAspectRatio matrix. These operations directly and substantially affect system performance at the system level, leading to notable performance variations. Additionally, the configuration involves some performance-related operations that are time-extensive within its related code, further confirming its performance sensitivity."
