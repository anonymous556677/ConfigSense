    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'AOI' is performance-sensitive. This is because the 'AOI' configuration involves performance-related operations that are time-expensive within its related code. The 'AOI' configuration directly affects system performance at the system level by computing the preserveAspectRatio matrix, transforming the AOI into the image's coordinate system, and setting the document size according to the hints. These operations contribute significantly to execution time and memory consumption, leading to notable performance variations at the system level."
