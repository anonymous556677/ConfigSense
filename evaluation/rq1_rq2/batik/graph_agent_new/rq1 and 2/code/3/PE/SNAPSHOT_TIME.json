    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'SNAPSHOT_TIME' is performance-sensitive. This is because the 'KEY_SNAPSHOT_TIME' is used within the code to set the current time for the animation engine, which can have a direct impact on the performance of the system. The 'KEY_SNAPSHOT_TIME' operation is time-expensive and can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, making this configuration performance-sensitive."
