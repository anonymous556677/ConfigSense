    "Reason": "The configuration option 'INDEXED' is not performance-sensitive. The code related to this configuration does not contain any time-expensive or memory-expensive operations that would lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The code mainly deals with setting parameters for image encoding and writing, which are not significant enough to impact system performance in a substantial way."
