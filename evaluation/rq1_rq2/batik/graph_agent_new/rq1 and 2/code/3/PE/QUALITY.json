    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'QUALITY' is performance-sensitive. This is because the 'QUALITY' configuration directly affects the performance of the system at the system level. The code snippet provided shows that the 'QUALITY' configuration is used to set the JPEG quality for image writing, which involves time-expensive operations such as setting the resolution and writing the image with specified quality. These operations can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, making the 'QUALITY' configuration performance-sensitive."
