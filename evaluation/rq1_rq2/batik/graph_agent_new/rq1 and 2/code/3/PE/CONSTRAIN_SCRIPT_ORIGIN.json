    "Reason": "The configuration option CONSTRAIN_SCRIPT_ORIGIN is not performance-sensitive. The code snippet related to this configuration does not involve any time-expensive or memory-expensive operations that would lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The configuration simply determines whether to constrain the script origin or not, which does not have a significant impact on system performance."
