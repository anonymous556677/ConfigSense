    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'WIDTH' is performance-sensitive. The 'WIDTH' configuration directly affects the system performance at the system level by determining the width and height of the output image, which involves time-expensive operations such as computing the preserveAspectRatio matrix, transforming the AOI into the image's coordinate system, and setting the size and viewBox on the output document. These operations contribute significantly to execution time and memory consumption, leading to notable performance variations at the system level."
