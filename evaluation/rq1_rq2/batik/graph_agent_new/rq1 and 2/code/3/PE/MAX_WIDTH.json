    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The MAX_WIDTH configuration option is not performance-sensitive. The code snippet provided does not contain any performance-related operations that significantly impact system performance at the system level. The computation of image width and height based on hints and the limitation of image size do not involve time-expensive or memory-expensive operations that would lead to notable performance variations. Therefore, the MAX_WIDTH configuration can be classified as not performance-sensitive."
