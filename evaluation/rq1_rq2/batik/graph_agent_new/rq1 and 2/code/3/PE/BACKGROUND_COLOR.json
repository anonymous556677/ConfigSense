    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option BACKGROUND_COLOR is performance-sensitive. The code snippet related to this configuration involves time-expensive and memory-expensive operations, such as setting the background color of the image using the hints provided. This operation directly affects the system performance at the system level by potentially causing notable performance variations, especially when dealing with large images. Therefore, the configuration is considered performance-sensitive."
