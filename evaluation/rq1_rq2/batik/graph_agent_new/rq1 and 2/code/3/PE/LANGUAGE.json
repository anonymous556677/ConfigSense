    "Reason": "The configuration option 'LANGUAGE' is not performance-sensitive. The code snippet provided is a simple method that returns the user language specified in the TranscodingHints or defaults to 'en' (english) if none is specified. This method does not involve any time-expensive or memory-expensive operations that would lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Therefore, the configuration is not considered performance-sensitive."
