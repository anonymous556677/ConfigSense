    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option EXECUTE_ONLOAD is performance-sensitive. This is because the code related to this configuration involves time-expensive operations such as building the GVT tree, dispatching an 'onload' event, and handling dynamic states. These operations directly impact system performance at the system level by consuming significant execution time and memory resources. Additionally, the presence of the KEY_EXECUTE_ONLOAD flag indicates that this configuration can lead to notable performance variations, making it performance-sensitive."
