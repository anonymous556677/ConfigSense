    "Reason": "The configuration option 'QUALITY' is performance-sensitive. The code snippet provided involves performance-related operations that are time-expensive, such as setting the JPEG quality and resolution parameters. These operations directly impact the system performance at the system level by affecting the image writing process. The quality of the image and the resolution settings can significantly impact the execution time and memory consumption, leading to notable performance variations."
