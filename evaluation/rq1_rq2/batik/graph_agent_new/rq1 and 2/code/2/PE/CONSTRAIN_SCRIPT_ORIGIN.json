    "Reason": "The configuration option CONSTRAIN_SCRIPT_ORIGIN does not directly involve any performance-related operations that are time-expensive or memory-expensive within its related code. The code snippet provided mainly deals with security settings for scripts and does not show any significant impact on system performance. Therefore, based on the code context and developer's information, the configuration is classified as not performance-sensitive."
