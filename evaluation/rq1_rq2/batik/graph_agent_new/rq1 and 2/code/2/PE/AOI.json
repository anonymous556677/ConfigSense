    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'AOI' is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the 'AOI' configuration directly affects the system performance at the system level by involving performance-related operations that are time-expensive within its related code. The 'AOI' configuration includes operations such as transforming the AOI into the image's coordinate system, computing the preserveAspectRatio matrix, and setting the document size according to the hints. These operations contribute significantly to the execution time and memory consumption of the system, leading to notable performance variations."
