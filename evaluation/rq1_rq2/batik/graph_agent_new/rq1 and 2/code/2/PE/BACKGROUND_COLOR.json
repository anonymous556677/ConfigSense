    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option BACKGROUND_COLOR is performance-sensitive. The code snippet related to this configuration involves time-expensive operations such as filling the background color of the image with hints.get(KEY_BACKGROUND_COLOR) and drawing the rendered image on the graphics context. These operations directly impact the execution time and memory consumption at the system level, leading to notable performance variations. Therefore, the configuration is considered performance-sensitive."
