    "Reason": "The configuration option 'INDEXED' is not performance-sensitive. Although the code snippet involves some image processing operations, such as handling indexed images and setting physical dimensions, these operations do not have a significant impact on system performance at the system level. The code snippet mainly deals with image encoding and output, which are not time-expensive or memory-expensive operations that would lead to notable performance variations."
