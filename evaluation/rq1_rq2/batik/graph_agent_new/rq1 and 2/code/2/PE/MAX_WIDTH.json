    "Reason": "The configuration option MAX_WIDTH is not performance-sensitive. The code snippet related to MAX_WIDTH does not involve any time-expensive or memory-expensive operations that would lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The MAX_WIDTH configuration is used to limit the image size based on hints, but the operations performed are not significant enough to cause substantial performance impacts."
