    "Reason": "The configuration option MAX_HEIGHT is performance-sensitive. The code snippet provided shows that the MAX_HEIGHT configuration directly affects the image size calculations within the setImageSize method. Depending on the value of MAX_HEIGHT, the width and height of the image are adjusted accordingly, which can have a significant impact on the performance of the system. If MAX_HEIGHT is set to a very large value, it can lead to notable performance variations in terms of execution time and memory consumption at the system level."
