    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'WIDTH' is performance-sensitive. The 'WIDTH' configuration directly affects the system performance at the system level by involving performance-related operations that are time-expensive within its related code. The 'WIDTH' configuration is used to determine the width of the output image in the 'transcode' method, which involves multiple calculations and transformations based on the provided hints. These calculations and transformations contribute significantly to the execution time and memory consumption of the system, leading to notable performance variations."
