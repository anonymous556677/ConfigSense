    "Reason": "The configuration option 'LANGUAGE' is not performance-sensitive. The code snippet provided is a simple method that retrieves the user language specified in the TranscodingHints. This operation does not involve any time-expensive or memory-expensive operations that would lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Therefore, the configuration does not directly and substantially affect system performance."
