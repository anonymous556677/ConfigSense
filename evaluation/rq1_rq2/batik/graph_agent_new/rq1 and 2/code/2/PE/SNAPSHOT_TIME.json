    "Reason": "The configuration option 'SNAPSHOT_TIME' is performance-sensitive. This is because the code snippet related to 'KEY_SNAPSHOT_TIME' involves time-expensive operations that directly affect system performance at the system level. The 'KEY_SNAPSHOT_TIME' configuration involves setting the current time for the animation engine based on the value provided. This operation can lead to notable performance variations, making it performance-sensitive."
