    "developer_understanding_on_working": "The configuration 'QUALITY' is used to specify the quality of the image to be written to the output. It is retrieved from the hints using the key 'KEY_QUALITY'. If the quality is not specified, a default value of 0.75f is used. The quality is then used to set the JPEG quality in the ImageWriterParams which is used to write the image to the output.",
    "developer_understanding_on_triggering_frequency": "The configuration is triggered whenever the writeImage method is called to write an image to the output. The frequency of triggering depends on how often the writeImage method is called in the system.",
    "developer_understanding_on_size_impact": "The impact of the 'QUALITY' configuration option is on the size and quality of the image output. A higher quality value will result in a larger file size but better image quality, while a lower quality value will result in a smaller file size but lower image quality. The configuration option allows for flexibility in balancing between image quality and file size."
