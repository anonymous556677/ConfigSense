    "Reason": "The configuration option 'LANGUAGE' is not performance-sensitive. The code context provided shows that the configuration only determines the user language returned by the getLanguages method. This does not have a direct and substantial impact on system performance at the system level. The configuration is simple and does not involve any complex or resource-intensive operations that would significantly affect performance."
