    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The MAX_WIDTH configuration is considered performance-sensitive because it directly affects the system performance by limiting the width of images. Oversized images can cause layout issues and performance degradation, so ensuring that images do not exceed the specified maximum width is crucial for maintaining optimal performance. Additionally, the configuration-related code directly modifies the width and height of images based on the MAX_WIDTH hints, showing a direct impact on system performance."
