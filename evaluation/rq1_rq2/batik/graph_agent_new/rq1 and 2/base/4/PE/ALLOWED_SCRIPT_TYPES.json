    "Reason": "The 'ALLOWED_SCRIPT_TYPES' configuration option is not performance-sensitive. The code snippet provided is simply building a list of allowed script types based on a hint present in the system. This operation does not involve any time-expensive or memory-expensive operations that would lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Additionally, the purpose of this configuration is to enhance security by restricting script types, rather than directly impacting system performance."
