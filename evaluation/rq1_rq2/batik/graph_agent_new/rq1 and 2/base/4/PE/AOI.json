    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'AOI' configuration option is considered performance-sensitive. This is because the 'KEY_AOI' hint directly impacts the transformation matrix calculation and image generation process, affecting the system performance at a substantial level. The code related to the 'AOI' configuration involves complex calculations and transformations based on the specified AOI dimensions, which can have a significant impact on the overall transcoding performance."
