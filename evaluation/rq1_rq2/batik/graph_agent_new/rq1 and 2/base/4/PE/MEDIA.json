    "Reason": "The configuration option 'MEDIA' is not performance-sensitive based on the provided code context and developer information. The code simply retrieves the CSS media of the user agent from the hints map or falls back to the super class method if not found. This operation is minimal and does not directly and substantially affect system performance at the system level. The configuration is only triggered when the getMedia() method is called, and the impact on system performance is trivial."
