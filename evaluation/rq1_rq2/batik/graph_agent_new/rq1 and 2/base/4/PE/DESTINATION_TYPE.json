    "Reason": "The DESTINATION_TYPE configuration does not directly and substantially affect system performance at the system level. It is primarily used to determine the type of destination file to be created during the conversion process, which does not have a significant impact on overall system performance. The code related to the configuration is mainly focused on file handling and setting the output file extension based on the destination type, which does not involve complex or resource-intensive operations that would classify it as performance-sensitive."
