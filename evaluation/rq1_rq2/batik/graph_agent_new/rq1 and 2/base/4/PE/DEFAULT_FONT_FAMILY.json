    "Reason": "The DEFAULT_FONT_FAMILY configuration option is not performance-sensitive. The code snippet provided shows that the configuration retrieves the default font family from a map of hints and falls back to the superclass method if the font family is not found. This configuration option only impacts the font family used in the system and does not have a significant impact on overall system performance. The code context does not indicate any direct and substantial effect on system performance at the system level."
