    "Reason": "The 'QUALITY' configuration option is not considered performance-sensitive based on the provided code context and developer information. Although the configuration directly affects the size and quality of the JPEG image being written, it does not have a substantial impact on the overall system performance at the system level. The code primarily deals with setting the quality of the image and does not involve complex or resource-intensive operations that would significantly impact system performance. Additionally, the configuration is triggered only when the writeImage method is called, which may not occur frequently enough to cause a noticeable performance impact."
