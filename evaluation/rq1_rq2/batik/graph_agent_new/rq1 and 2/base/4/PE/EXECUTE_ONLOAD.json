    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'EXECUTE_ONLOAD' is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the behavior of the transcoding process by determining if the document is dynamic and if scripts need to be loaded and executed. This can significantly affect system performance at the system level, especially when handling large SVG documents with complex interactions and animations. The code context shows that the 'EXECUTE_ONLOAD' configuration option triggers the dispatch of an 'onload' event and sets the dynamic state of the document, which can have substantial performance implications."
