    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The WIDTH configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the size of the output image, which can have a substantial effect on system performance. The configuration is checked multiple times in the code to calculate the width and height of the image based on document size and hints. Additionally, it limits the image size based on maximum size hints, further emphasizing its performance impact."
