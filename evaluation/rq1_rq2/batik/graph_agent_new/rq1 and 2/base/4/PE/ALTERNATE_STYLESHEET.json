    "Reason": "The ALTERNATE_STYLESHEET configuration option is not performance-sensitive based on the provided code context and developer information. The configuration is related to customizing the style-sheet for the user agent, which affects the appearance of the user interface. It does not directly and substantially impact system performance at the system level. The code snippet provided simply retrieves the alternate style-sheet title from the hints map or falls back to the super class method if not found, which does not involve any complex or resource-intensive operations."
