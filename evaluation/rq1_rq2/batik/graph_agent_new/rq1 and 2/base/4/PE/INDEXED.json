    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The INDEXED configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the image processing and encoding process in the writeImage method. Depending on the value of PNGTranscoder.KEY_INDEXED, the method adjusts the image by calling IndexImage.getIndexedImage, which can significantly affect the system performance at the image processing level. The configuration directly influences the number of colors used in the indexed image, which can have a substantial impact on the size and quality of the resulting image, making it a performance-sensitive configuration."
