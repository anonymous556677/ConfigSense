    "Reason": "The configuration option 'MEDIA' is not performance-sensitive. The code snippet provided simply retrieves the CSS media value of the user agent from the hints map or falls back to the super class method. This operation is minimal and does not contribute significantly to execution time or memory consumption at the system level. Therefore, it does not lead to notable performance variations and can be classified as non-performance-sensitive."
