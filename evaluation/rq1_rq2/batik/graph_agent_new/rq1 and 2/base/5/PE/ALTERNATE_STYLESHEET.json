    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The ALTERNATE_STYLESHEET configuration option is not performance-sensitive based on the provided code context and developer information. The configuration code is a simple method that retrieves the alternate style-sheet title for the user agent. It does not involve any time-expensive or memory-expensive operations that would lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The developer also mentioned that the impact of this configuration on system performance is minimal, further supporting the classification of 'No'."
