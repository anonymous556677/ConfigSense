    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'WIDTH' is performance-sensitive because it directly affects the size of the output image, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The 'WIDTH' configuration is used in calculations to set the size of the image, and changing the 'WIDTH' value will result in different image sizes, impacting the overall appearance and layout of the image. This direct impact on the output image size qualifies 'WIDTH' as a performance-sensitive configuration."
