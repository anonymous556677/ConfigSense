    "Reason": "The DEFAULT_FONT_FAMILY configuration option is not performance-sensitive. The code snippet provided simply retrieves the default font family from hints or falls back to a super class method if not set. This operation is not time-expensive or memory-expensive, and it does not lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The configuration option only determines the default font family used in the system, which is a trivial impact on performance."
