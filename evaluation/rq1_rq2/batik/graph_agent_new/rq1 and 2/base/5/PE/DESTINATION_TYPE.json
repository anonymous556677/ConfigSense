    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The DESTINATION_TYPE configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the system performance at the system level. The code related to the configuration involves operations that are time-expensive, such as computing the set of sources, destination files, transcoder selection, and transcoding hints. These operations contribute significantly to the execution time and memory consumption during the conversion process, leading to notable performance variations at the system level."
