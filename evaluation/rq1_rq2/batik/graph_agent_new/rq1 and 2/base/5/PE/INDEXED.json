    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'INDEXED' configuration option is classified as performance-sensitive. This classification is based on the fact that the configuration directly impacts the color depth and size of the resulting PNG image, which can have a notable performance variation at the system level. The code snippet related to the 'INDEXED' configuration involves operations that are time-expensive, such as adjusting the image based on the specified number of colors. These operations can contribute significantly to execution time and memory consumption, making the configuration performance-sensitive."
