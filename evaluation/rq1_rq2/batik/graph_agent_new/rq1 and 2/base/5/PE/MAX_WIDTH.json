    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The MAX_WIDTH configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly affects the system performance by limiting the width of images, which can have a significant impact on memory consumption and execution time. The code snippet related to the MAX_WIDTH configuration involves time-expensive and memory-expensive operations, such as resizing images based on the MAX_WIDTH value. This can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, making it a performance-sensitive configuration."
