    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'HEIGHT' configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly affects the size of the image being transcoded, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The configuration involves time-expensive operations such as computing the preserveAspectRatio matrix and setting the image size based on the height value. Additionally, the configuration considers maximum size hints to limit the image size, which further emphasizes its impact on performance."
