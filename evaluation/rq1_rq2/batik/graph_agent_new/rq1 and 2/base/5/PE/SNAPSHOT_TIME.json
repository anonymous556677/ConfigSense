    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'SNAPSHOT_TIME' is performance-sensitive because it directly affects the system performance at the system level. The code snippet related to the 'SNAPSHOT_TIME' configuration involves time-expensive operations such as setting the current time of the animation engine to the specified snapshot time. This operation can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, especially during dynamic document processing and animation playback. Therefore, the 'SNAPSHOT_TIME' configuration is considered performance-sensitive."
