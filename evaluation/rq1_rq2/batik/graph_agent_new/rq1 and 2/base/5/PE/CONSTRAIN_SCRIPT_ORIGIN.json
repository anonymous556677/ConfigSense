    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The 'CONSTRAIN_SCRIPT_ORIGIN' configuration option is not performance-sensitive based on the provided code context and developer information. The configuration directly impacts the security settings for scripts in the system by determining whether to constrain the origin of a script. While the configuration may have an impact on system security, it does not involve any performance-related operations that are time-expensive or memory-expensive within its related code. The configuration simply sets a boolean variable based on a hint value and returns different ScriptSecurity objects accordingly. The configuration does not lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
