    "Reason": "The USER_STYLESHEET_URI configuration option is not performance-sensitive. The code snippet provided retrieves the user stylesheet URI specified in the TranscodingHints and falls back to the superclass method if the URI is not found. This configuration option has a limited impact on the specific functionality related to retrieving the user stylesheet URI and does not have a significant impact on the overall system performance."
