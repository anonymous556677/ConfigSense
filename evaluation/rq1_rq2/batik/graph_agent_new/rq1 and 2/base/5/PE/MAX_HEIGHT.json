    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The MAX_HEIGHT configuration option is performance-sensitive because it directly affects the system performance at the system level. The code snippet provided shows that the configuration is used to limit the height of the processed image based on the configured value. This involves time-expensive operations such as calculations to adjust the image size according to the configured MAX_HEIGHT value. If the input images have heights greater than the configured MAX_HEIGHT value, additional computations are required to resize the image, leading to notable performance variations at the system level."
