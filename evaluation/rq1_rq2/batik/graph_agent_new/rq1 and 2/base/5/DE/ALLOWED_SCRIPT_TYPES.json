It checks if the hints contain the key 'KEY_ALLOWED_SCRIPT_TYPES', retrieves the value associated with that key, and then tokenizes the value to build the list of allowed scripts.",

By defining a specific set of allowed script types, the system can control which scripts are executed, reducing the risk of malicious scripts being run and ensuring that only approved scripts are allowed."
