    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'EXECUTE_ONLOAD' is performance-sensitive. The code snippet related to this configuration involves operations that are time-expensive and memory-expensive, such as building the GVT tree, handling dynamic states, dispatching events, and computing transformations. These operations directly impact system performance at the system level, leading to notable performance variations. Additionally, the 'EXECUTE_ONLOAD' configuration determines whether onload scripts or events should be executed, which can significantly affect the dynamic behavior and rendering of SVG documents, making it a performance-sensitive configuration."
