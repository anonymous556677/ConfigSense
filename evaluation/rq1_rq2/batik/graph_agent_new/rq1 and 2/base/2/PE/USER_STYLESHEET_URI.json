    "Reason": "The USER_STYLESHEET_URI configuration option is not performance-sensitive. The code snippet provided retrieves the user stylesheet URI specified in the TranscodingHints. This operation is limited to retrieving the URI and does not involve any time-expensive or memory-expensive operations that would lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Additionally, the developer's understanding indicates that the impact of this configuration option is minimal and does not significantly affect the overall system functionality."
