    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The DESTINATION_TYPE configuration is performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly impacts the type of destination file to be created during the conversion process, which involves time-expensive operations such as setting the transcoder and computing transcoding hints based on the destination type. These operations contribute significantly to the execution time and memory consumption at the system level, leading to notable performance variations."
