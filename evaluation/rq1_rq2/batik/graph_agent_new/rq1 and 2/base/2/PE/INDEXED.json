    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The INDEXED configuration option is classified as performance-sensitive. This classification is based on the fact that the configuration directly impacts the color palette of PNG images, potentially reducing the file size but also affecting the color accuracy and quality. The code snippet checks for the PNGTranscoder.KEY_INDEXED hint and performs image conversion operations based on the value retrieved. These operations can be time-expensive and memory-expensive, leading to notable performance variations at the system level when encoding PNG images with different color palettes."
