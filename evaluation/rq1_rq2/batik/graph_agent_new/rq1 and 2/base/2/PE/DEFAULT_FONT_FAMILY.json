    "Reason": "The DEFAULT_FONT_FAMILY configuration option is not performance-sensitive. The code snippet provided retrieves the default font family from a map of hints and falls back to the superclass method if the font family is not found in the map. This operation is limited to the font family used in the system and does not involve any time-expensive or memory-expensive operations that would lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Therefore, the configuration does not have a substantial impact on system performance."
