    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The MAX_WIDTH configuration is considered performance-sensitive because it directly affects the system performance by limiting the width of images. The code snippet related to the MAX_WIDTH configuration involves time-expensive operations such as computing image width and height based on hints, checking for maximum width values, and adjusting image size accordingly. These operations can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, especially when resizing images frequently. Therefore, the MAX_WIDTH configuration is classified as performance-sensitive."
