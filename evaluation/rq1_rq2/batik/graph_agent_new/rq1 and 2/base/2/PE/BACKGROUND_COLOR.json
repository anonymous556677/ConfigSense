    "Reason": "The BACKGROUND_COLOR configuration option is not performance-sensitive based on the provided code context and developer's information. Although setting the background color can impact the visual appearance of the transcoded image, the code snippet related to handling the background color does not involve any time-expensive or memory-expensive operations that would lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The operation of setting the background color is a standard graphical operation and does not directly and substantially affect system performance."
