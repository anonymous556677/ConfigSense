    "Reason": "The QUALITY configuration option is not performance-sensitive based on the provided code context and developer information. While the quality value does impact the file size of the JPEG image written to the output stream, it does not directly and substantially affect system performance at the system level. The configuration-related code mainly focuses on setting the quality and resolution parameters for the image writer, which does not involve any time-extensive or memory-extensive operations that would lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
