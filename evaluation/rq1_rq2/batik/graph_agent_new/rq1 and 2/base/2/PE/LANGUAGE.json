    "Reason": "The configuration option 'LANGUAGE' is not performance-sensitive. The code snippet provided simply returns the user language specified in the TranscodingHints or defaults to English ('en'). This operation is not time-expensive or memory-expensive, and it does not lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Therefore, the configuration does not directly and substantially affect system performance."
