    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The 'AOI' configuration option is not performance-sensitive based on the provided code context and developer information. The configuration mainly deals with transforming the Area of Interest (AOI) into the image's coordinate system by applying scaling and translation matrices. Although it may impact the size of the image being transcoded, it does not involve any time-expensive or memory-expensive operations that lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The configuration does not directly and substantially affect system performance, and the operations related to 'AOI' are more focused on image transformation rather than performance optimization."
