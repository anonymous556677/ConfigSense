    "Reason": "The 'ALLOWED_SCRIPT_TYPES' configuration option is not performance-sensitive. The code snippet provided is focused on building a list of allowed script types based on a provided hint. This operation does not involve any time-expensive or memory-expensive tasks that would significantly impact system performance. Additionally, the purpose of this configuration is more related to security and functionality rather than performance optimization. Therefore, it does not lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
