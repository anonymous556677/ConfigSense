    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'WIDTH' is considered performance-sensitive because it directly affects the size of the output image, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Changing the width of the image impacts the visual representation and requires computations to resize the image while maintaining the aspect ratio. The 'WIDTH' configuration involves time-expensive operations related to image resizing and memory-expensive operations to store the resized image, leading to significant performance impact."
