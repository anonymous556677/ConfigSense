    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'SNAPSHOT_TIME' is performance-sensitive because it directly affects the timing and synchronization of animations in the system. The code related to the 'SNAPSHOT_TIME' configuration involves setting the animation engine's current time based on the 'KEY_SNAPSHOT_TIME' hint, which can have a notable impact on system performance. This operation is time-expensive as it involves updating the animation engine's current time, which can lead to significant performance variations at the system level."
