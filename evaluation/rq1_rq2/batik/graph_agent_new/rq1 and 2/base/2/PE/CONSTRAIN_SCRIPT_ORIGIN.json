    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option CONSTRAIN_SCRIPT_ORIGIN is performance-sensitive. This is because the value of the constrainOrigin variable directly impacts the security settings applied to scripts, which can have a notable performance impact at the system level. The code snippet related to this configuration involves conditional checks and the creation of different ScriptSecurity objects based on the value of constrainOrigin, which can contribute to execution time and memory consumption. Therefore, the configuration is considered performance-sensitive as it directly and substantially affects system performance by determining the level of security measures applied to scripts."
