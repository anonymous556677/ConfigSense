    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The HEIGHT configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly affects the size and aspect ratio of the output image being transcoded. The configuration involves time-expensive operations such as computing the image's width and height based on hints and limiting the image size according to maximum size hints. These operations contribute significantly to the execution time and memory consumption of the system, leading to notable performance variations at the system level."
