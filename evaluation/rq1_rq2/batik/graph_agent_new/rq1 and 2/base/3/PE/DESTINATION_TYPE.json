    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The DESTINATION_TYPE configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly affects the system performance at the system level. The configuration involves performance-related operations such as setting the transcoder to use for the operation and computing transcoding hints, which are time-expensive and memory-expensive operations. These operations lead to notable performance variations during the conversion process, making the configuration performance-sensitive."
