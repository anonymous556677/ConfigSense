    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The 'AOI' configuration option in the provided code context does not directly involve any performance-sensitive operations that significantly impact system performance at the system level. The configuration mainly focuses on defining an Area of Interest (AOI) in the SVG document being transcoded as an image and adjusting the image size based on the specified AOI. The operations related to setting the image size and applying transformation matrices based on the AOI do not exhibit time-expensive or memory-expensive characteristics that would lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Therefore, the 'AOI' configuration is classified as not performance-sensitive."
