    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option MAX_HEIGHT is performance-sensitive. This is because the code snippet provided involves performance-related operations that directly impact the execution time and memory consumption of the system. The resizing of images based on the MAX_HEIGHT value can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, especially when dealing with large images. Limiting the height of images based on the MAX_HEIGHT configuration involves calculations that can be time-expensive and memory-expensive, making it a performance-sensitive configuration."
