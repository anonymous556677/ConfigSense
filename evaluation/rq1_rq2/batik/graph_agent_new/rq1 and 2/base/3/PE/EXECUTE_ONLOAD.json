    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'EXECUTE_ONLOAD' configuration option is performance-sensitive. The code snippet related to this configuration involves time-expensive operations such as building the GVT tree, dispatching onload events, and computing the preserveAspectRatio matrix. These operations directly impact the system performance by affecting the transcoding process. Enabling the 'EXECUTE_ONLOAD' configuration can lead to notable performance variations at the system level due to the dynamic nature of the document and the execution of potentially resource-intensive onload scripts."
