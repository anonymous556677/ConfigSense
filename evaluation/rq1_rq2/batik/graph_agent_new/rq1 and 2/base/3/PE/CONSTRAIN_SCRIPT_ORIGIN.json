    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The 'CONSTRAIN_SCRIPT_ORIGIN' configuration option is not performance-sensitive based on the provided code context and developer information. The configuration is primarily focused on determining the security settings for scripts based on whether to constrain the script origin or not. While the configuration may impact the behavior of the system in terms of security measures, it does not involve any time-expensive or memory-expensive operations that would lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Additionally, the code snippet related to the configuration does not show any significant performance-related operations that would classify it as performance-sensitive."
