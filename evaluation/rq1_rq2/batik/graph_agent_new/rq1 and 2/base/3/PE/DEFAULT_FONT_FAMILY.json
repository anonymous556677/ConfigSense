    "Reason": "The configuration option DEFAULT_FONT_FAMILY is not performance-sensitive. The code snippet provided retrieves the default font family from hints using a key and falls back to the super class's default font family if not found. This operation is not time-expensive or memory-expensive, and changing the default font family does not lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The impact of this configuration is limited to the font family used in the system, affecting the look and feel of the application."
