    "Reason": "The MAX_WIDTH configuration option is performance-sensitive. The configuration directly affects the system performance by limiting the width of images in the document, which can have a significant impact on the execution time and memory consumption. The code snippet related to the MAX_WIDTH configuration involves time-expensive operations such as adjusting the image width and height based on the specified maximum width, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
