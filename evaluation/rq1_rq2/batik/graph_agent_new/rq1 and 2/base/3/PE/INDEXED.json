    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'INDEXED' configuration option is classified as performance-sensitive. This classification is based on the fact that the configuration directly affects how images are processed and encoded by the PNGTranscoder. The code snippet related to the 'INDEXED' configuration checks for specific values (1, 2, 4, or 8) in the PNGTranscoder hints and calls a method to create an indexed image. This operation can have a notable performance impact on the system level, especially when dealing with a large number of images. Therefore, the configuration is considered performance-sensitive due to its direct and substantial effect on system performance."
