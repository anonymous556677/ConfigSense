    "Reason": "The 'ALTERNATE_STYLESHEET' configuration option is not performance-sensitive. The code snippet provided shows that it simply retrieves a value from the hints map or falls back to the superclass method. This operation is not time-expensive or memory-expensive, and it does not lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Therefore, the configuration does not have a significant impact on system performance."
