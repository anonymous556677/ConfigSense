    "Reason": "The 'LANGUAGE' configuration option is not performance-sensitive. The code snippet provided does not contain any performance-related operations that significantly impact system performance. The configuration simply checks for the presence of a language key in the 'hints' map and returns the associated value or falls back to a default language. This operation is not time-expensive or memory-expensive and does not lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
