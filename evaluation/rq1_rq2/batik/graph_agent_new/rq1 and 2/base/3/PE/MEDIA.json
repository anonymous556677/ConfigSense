    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The 'MEDIA' configuration option is not performance-sensitive. The code snippet provided shows that it simply retrieves a value from the hints map or falls back to the superclass method, which does not involve any time-expensive or memory-expensive operations. This configuration does not directly and substantially affect system performance at the system level, and it does not lead to notable performance variations. Therefore, it is classified as not performance-sensitive."
