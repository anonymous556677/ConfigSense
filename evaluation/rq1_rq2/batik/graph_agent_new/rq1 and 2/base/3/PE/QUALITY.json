    "Reason": "The 'QUALITY' configuration option is not performance-sensitive. Although it affects the quality and size of the JPEG images being written, it does not directly and substantially impact system performance at the system level. The code snippet related to the 'QUALITY' configuration involves setting the JPEG quality in the ImageWriterParams based on a specified or default quality value, which does not involve time-expensive or memory-expensive operations that lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
