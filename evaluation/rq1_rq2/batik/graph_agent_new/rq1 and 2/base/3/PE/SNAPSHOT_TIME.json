    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'SNAPSHOT_TIME' is performance-sensitive because it directly affects the timing and synchronization of animations in the SVG document at the system level. The code snippet related to 'SNAPSHOT_TIME' involves time-expensive operations such as setting the current time for the animation engine based on the value provided in the hints. This can lead to notable performance variations in the system, especially when dealing with dynamic documents and dispatching 'onload' events. Therefore, the configuration is considered performance-sensitive."
