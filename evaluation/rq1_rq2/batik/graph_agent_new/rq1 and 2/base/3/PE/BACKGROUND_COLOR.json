    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The BACKGROUND_COLOR configuration option is not performance-sensitive based on the provided code context and developer information. The configuration involves setting the background color of the transcoded image, which does not have a significant impact on system performance. The code snippet related to setting the background color does not contain any time-expensive or memory-expensive operations that would lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Therefore, the configuration is classified as not performance-sensitive."
