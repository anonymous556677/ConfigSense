    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The 'WIDTH' configuration option is not performance-sensitive based on the provided code context and developer's information. The configuration is used to set the width of the output image during the transcoding process. Although it impacts the size of the image being transcoded, it does not involve any performance-related operations that are time-expensive or memory-expensive within its related code. The configuration directly affects the dimensions of the image but does not lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Therefore, it is classified as not performance-sensitive."
