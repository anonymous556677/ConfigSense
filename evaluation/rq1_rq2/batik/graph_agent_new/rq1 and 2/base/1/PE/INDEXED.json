    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'INDEXED' is performance-sensitive. The code context shows that the 'KEY_INDEXED' is checked in the hints, and based on its value, operations are performed on the image. These operations can have a significant impact on the execution time and memory consumption, especially when different values (1, 2, 4, 8) trigger different processing paths for the image. This can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, making the configuration performance-sensitive."
