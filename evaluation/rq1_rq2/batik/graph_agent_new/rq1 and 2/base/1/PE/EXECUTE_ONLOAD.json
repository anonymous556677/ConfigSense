    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'EXECUTE_ONLOAD' is not performance-sensitive based on the provided code context and developer's information. The configuration is primarily used to determine if scripts need to be loaded and if an 'onload' event needs to be dispatched during the transcoding process. While it impacts the behavior of the transcoding process, it does not directly involve any time-expensive or memory-expensive operations that would lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The code related to the 'EXECUTE_ONLOAD' configuration does not show any significant performance-related operations that would classify it as performance-sensitive."
