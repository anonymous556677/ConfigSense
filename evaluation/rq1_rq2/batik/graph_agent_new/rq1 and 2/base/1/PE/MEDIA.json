    "Reason": "The 'MEDIA' configuration option is not performance-sensitive. The code snippet provided for the 'getMedia()' method does not contain any performance-intensive operations that would lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The configuration only retrieves the CSS media value of the user agent, which has limited impact on the overall system functionality. Therefore, it does not directly and substantially affect system performance or involve time-extensive or memory-extensive operations."
