    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The 'ALLOWED_SCRIPT_TYPES' configuration option is not performance-sensitive. The code snippet provided is responsible for building a list of allowed values for the <script> element's type attribute, which involves tokenizing a string and adding tokens to a list. This operation is not time-expensive or memory-expensive and does not lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The configuration's impact is limited to the specific functionality that requires the allowed script types, and it does not directly and substantially affect system performance."
