    "Reason": "The DEFAULT_FONT_FAMILY configuration option is not performance-sensitive. The code snippet provided retrieves the default font family from hints or falls back to the super class's default font family if not found. This operation is limited to determining the font family used for text display and does not involve any time-expensive or memory-expensive operations that would lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Therefore, the configuration does not have a substantial impact on system performance."
