    "Reason": "The BACKGROUND_COLOR configuration option is not performance-sensitive based on the provided code context and developer information. The configuration involves setting the background color before rendering the image, which is a trivial operation and does not have a significant impact on system performance. The configuration-related code snippet does not contain any time-expensive or memory-expensive operations that would lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
