    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The MAX_WIDTH configuration option is performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly affects the system performance by limiting the width of images, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The code snippet related to the MAX_WIDTH configuration involves time-expensive operations such as resizing images based on the specified maximum width, which can impact the overall execution time and memory consumption of the system."
