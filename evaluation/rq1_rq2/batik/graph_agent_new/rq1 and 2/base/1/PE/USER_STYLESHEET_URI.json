    "Reason": "The USER_STYLESHEET_URI configuration option is not performance-sensitive. The code snippet provided shows that it simply retrieves the user stylesheet URI specified in the TranscodingHints. This operation is straightforward and does not involve any time-expensive or memory-expensive operations. Additionally, the developer's understanding confirms that the impact of this configuration is limited to the specific functionality of retrieving the URI and does not have a significant impact on the overall system performance."
