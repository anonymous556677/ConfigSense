    "Reason": "The DESTINATION_TYPE configuration is performance-sensitive. The configuration directly affects the type of destination file to be created during the conversion process, which can have a significant impact on the overall performance of the system. The code snippets related to the configuration involve time-expensive operations such as computing sources, computing destination files, setting transcoding hints, and converting files one by one. These operations contribute to notable performance variations at the system level, making the configuration performance-sensitive."
