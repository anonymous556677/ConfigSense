    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'AOI' configuration is considered performance-sensitive. The configuration involves operations that are time-expensive and memory-expensive within the related code. Specifically, the transformation of the Area of Interest (AOI) into the image's coordinate system and the application of scaling factors can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. These operations directly impact the execution time and memory consumption during the transcoding process, making the 'AOI' configuration performance-sensitive."
