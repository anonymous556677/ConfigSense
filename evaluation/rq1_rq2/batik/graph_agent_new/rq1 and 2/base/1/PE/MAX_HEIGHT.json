    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The MAX_HEIGHT configuration option is considered performance-sensitive because it directly affects the system performance by limiting the height of an image according to the hints provided. The setImageSize method, which includes the MAX_HEIGHT configuration, involves time-expensive operations such as computing image dimensions and adjusting them based on the maximum height. These operations can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, especially when dealing with large images. Therefore, the MAX_HEIGHT configuration is performance-sensitive and can have a significant impact on system performance."
