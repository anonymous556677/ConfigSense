    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'SNAPSHOT_TIME' is performance-sensitive because it directly affects the system performance at the system level. The 'SNAPSHOT_TIME' configuration involves time-extensive operations within its related code, specifically setting the current time for the animation engine, which impacts the rendering of the SVG document at that specific time. This operation can lead to notable performance variations, especially when triggered during the 'onload' event and in certain conditions for SVG 1.2 documents."
