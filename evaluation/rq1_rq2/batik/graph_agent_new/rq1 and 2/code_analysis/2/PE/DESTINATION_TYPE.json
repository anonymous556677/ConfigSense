    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option DESTINATION_TYPE is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the DESTINATION_TYPE configuration directly affects the system performance at the system level. The code snippets related to the DESTINATION_TYPE configuration involve time-expensive operations such as computing sources, computing destination files, setting transcoding hints, and transcoding files one by one. These operations contribute significantly to execution time and memory consumption, leading to notable performance variations at the system level."
