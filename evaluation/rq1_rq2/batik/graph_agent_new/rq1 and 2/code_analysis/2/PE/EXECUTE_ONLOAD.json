    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option EXECUTE_ONLOAD is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the configuration involves the KEY_EXECUTE_ONLOAD hint, which determines if the document is dynamic and requires the execution of scripts and dispatching of events. These operations are time-expensive and memory-expensive, as they involve building the GVT tree, handling dynamic states, loading scripts, and dispatching events. These operations directly impact system performance at the system level by introducing notable performance variations due to the execution time and memory consumption involved in handling dynamic document behavior."
