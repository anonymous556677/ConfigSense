    "Reason": "The configuration option 'HEIGHT' is not performance-sensitive. The code context provided does not contain any performance-sensitive operations that directly and substantially affect system performance at the system level. The 'HEIGHT' configuration is used to set the height of an image based on hints and does not involve any time-expensive or memory-expensive operations that lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
