    "Reason": "The configuration option DEFAULT_FONT_FAMILY is not performance-sensitive. The code snippet provided does not involve any performance-related operations that are time-expensive or memory-expensive. The method simply retrieves a font family value from hints or falls back to a default value, without any complex computations or memory-intensive operations. Additionally, the configuration does not directly and substantially affect system performance at the system level, as it is a simple retrieval of a font family value."
