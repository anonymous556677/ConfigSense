    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'WIDTH' is performance-sensitive. The 'WIDTH' configuration directly affects the system performance at the system level by involving performance-related operations that are time-expensive within its related code. The code snippet related to the 'WIDTH' configuration includes operations such as computing image size, setting document size, and determining width and height of the output image based on hints. These operations contribute significantly to execution time and memory consumption, leading to notable performance variations at the system level."
