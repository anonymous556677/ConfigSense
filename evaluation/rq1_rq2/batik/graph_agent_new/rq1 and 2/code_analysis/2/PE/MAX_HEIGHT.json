    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option MAX_HEIGHT is performance-sensitive. The code snippet provided shows that the MAX_HEIGHT configuration directly impacts the image size calculations within the setImageSize method. If the imgMaxHeight hint is provided and the height exceeds this maximum height, the width and height calculations are adjusted accordingly. This directly affects the performance of the system by potentially resizing the image based on the MAX_HEIGHT configuration, leading to notable performance variations at the system level."
