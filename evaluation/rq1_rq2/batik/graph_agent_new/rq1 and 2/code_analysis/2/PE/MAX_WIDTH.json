    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'MAX_WIDTH' is performance-sensitive. The code snippet provided shows that the 'MAX_WIDTH' configuration directly impacts the image size calculations within the 'setImageSize' method. Depending on the value of 'MAX_WIDTH', the width and height of the image are adjusted accordingly, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The calculations involving 'MAX_WIDTH' are time-expensive operations that directly affect the performance of the system."
