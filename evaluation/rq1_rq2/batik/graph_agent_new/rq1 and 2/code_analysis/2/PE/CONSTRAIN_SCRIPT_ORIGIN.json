    "Reason": "The configuration option CONSTRAIN_SCRIPT_ORIGIN is not performance-sensitive. The configuration option is used to determine whether to constrain the origin of a script, which does not involve any time-expensive or memory-expensive operations. The code snippet related to this configuration simply checks the value of CONSTRAIN_SCRIPT_ORIGIN in the hints and returns different ScriptSecurity objects based on its value. This configuration does not directly and substantially affect system performance at the system level."
