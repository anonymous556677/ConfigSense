{
    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'SNAPSHOT_TIME' is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the 'KEY_SNAPSHOT_TIME' configuration parameter directly affects the current time of the animation engine, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The code snippet that handles the 'KEY_SNAPSHOT_TIME' configuration involves time-expensive operations such as setting the current time of the animation engine based on the value provided. This can have a significant impact on the overall performance of the system, making it a performance-sensitive configuration."
