    "Reason": "The configuration option USER_STYLESHEET_URI is not performance-sensitive. The code snippet provided does not contain any performance-related operations that are time-expensive or memory-expensive. The method getUserStyleSheetURI simply retrieves a value from TranscodingHints and returns it, which does not have a substantial impact on system performance at the system level."
