{
    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'LANGUAGE' is not performance-sensitive. The code snippet provided for the 'LANGUAGE' configuration simply checks for a language key in the 'TranscodingHints' and returns the value if present, otherwise it returns 'en' (english). This operation is not time-expensive or memory-expensive and does not lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Therefore, the configuration is classified as not performance-sensitive."
