    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'QUALITY' is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the 'QUALITY' configuration directly affects the performance of the system at the system level. The code snippet provided shows that the 'QUALITY' configuration is used to set the JPEG quality for image writing, which involves time-expensive operations such as setting resolution and writing the image. These operations can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, making the 'QUALITY' configuration performance-sensitive."
