    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'INDEXED' is not performance-sensitive. The code related to this configuration does not contain any performance-related operations that are time-expensive or memory-expensive. The configuration mainly deals with setting parameters for PNG image encoding, such as setting background color, gamma value, resolution, etc. These operations are standard image processing tasks and do not lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
