    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'AOI' is performance-sensitive. The 'AOI' configuration involves performance-related operations that are time-expensive within its related code. Specifically, the 'setImageSize' method modifies global variables 'width' and 'height' based on the 'KEY_AOI' hint, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Additionally, the 'transcode' method calculates the 'preserveAspectRatio' matrix based on the 'KEY_AOI' hint, which involves complex transformations that can impact system performance significantly. Therefore, the 'AOI' configuration is classified as performance-sensitive."
