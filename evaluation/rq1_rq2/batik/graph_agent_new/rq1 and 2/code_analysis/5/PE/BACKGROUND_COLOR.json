    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option BACKGROUND_COLOR is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the code snippet related to the configuration involves time-expensive and memory-expensive operations. Specifically, the code snippet checks if the hints contain the KEY_BACKGROUND_COLOR, sets the background color using the Paint object, fills the background color in the graphics context, and draws the rendered image on the graphics context. These operations directly impact the system performance at the system level, leading to notable performance variations."
