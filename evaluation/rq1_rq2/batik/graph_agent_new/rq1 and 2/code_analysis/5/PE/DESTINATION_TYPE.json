    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option DESTINATION_TYPE is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the DESTINATION_TYPE configuration directly affects the system performance at the system level. The code snippets related to the DESTINATION_TYPE configuration involve time-expensive operations such as computing the set of transcoding hints, creating output directories, and transcoding files one by one. These operations contribute significantly to the execution time and memory consumption of the system, leading to notable performance variations at the system level."
