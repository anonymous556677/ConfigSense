    "Reason": "The configuration option 'MEDIA' does not involve any performance-related operations that are time-expensive or memory-expensive within its related code. The code snippet provided is a simple method that retrieves a string value from a map and returns it. This operation is not time-consuming or memory-intensive, and it does not lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Therefore, the 'MEDIA' configuration is not performance-sensitive."
