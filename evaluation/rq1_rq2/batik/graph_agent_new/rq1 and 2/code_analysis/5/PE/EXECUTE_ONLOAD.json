    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option EXECUTE_ONLOAD is performance-sensitive. The code context provided contains performance-related operations that are time-expensive and memory-expensive. The configuration directly affects system performance at the system level by handling dynamic document loading, building the GVT tree, dispatching events, and computing transformations. These operations contribute significantly to execution time and memory consumption, leading to notable performance variations at the system level."
