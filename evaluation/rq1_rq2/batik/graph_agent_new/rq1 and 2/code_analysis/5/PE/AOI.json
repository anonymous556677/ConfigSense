    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'AOI' is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the 'AOI' configuration involves performance-related operations that are time-expensive within its related code. Specifically, the 'AOI' configuration calculates and applies a transformation matrix based on the 'KEY_AOI' hint, which involves multiple mathematical operations such as scaling and translating. These operations can have a notable performance impact at the system level, especially when dealing with large SVG documents and complex transformations."
