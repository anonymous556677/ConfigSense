    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The configuration option DEFAULT_FONT_FAMILY is not performance-sensitive. The code snippet provided shows that the getDefaultFontFamily method simply retrieves a value from hints or falls back to a default value. There are no performance-intensive operations or notable performance variations at the system level related to this configuration. Additionally, the code does not involve any time-expensive or memory-expensive operations within its related code. Therefore, the configuration is not classified as performance-sensitive."
