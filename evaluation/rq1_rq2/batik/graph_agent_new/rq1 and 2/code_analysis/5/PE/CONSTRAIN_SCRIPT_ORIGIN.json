    "Reason": "The configuration option CONSTRAIN_SCRIPT_ORIGIN is not performance-sensitive based on the provided code context and developer's information. The configuration setting only determines whether to use DefaultScriptSecurity or RelaxedScriptSecurity, which does not involve any time-expensive or memory-expensive operations that would lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The configuration setting does not directly and substantially affect system performance, and the code snippet related to this configuration does not show any performance-sensitive operations."
