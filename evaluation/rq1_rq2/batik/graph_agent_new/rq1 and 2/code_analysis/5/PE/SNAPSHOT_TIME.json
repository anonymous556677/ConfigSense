{
    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'SNAPSHOT_TIME' is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the 'KEY_SNAPSHOT_TIME' configuration involves time-expensive operations within the 'transcode' method. Specifically, the code snippet 'if (hints.containsKey(KEY_SNAPSHOT_TIME))' checks for the presence of 'KEY_SNAPSHOT_TIME' in the hints map and performs operations based on its value, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. This configuration directly affects system performance by setting the current time in the animation engine, which is a time-expensive operation. Therefore, the 'SNAPSHOT_TIME' configuration is classified as performance-sensitive."
