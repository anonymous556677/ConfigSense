    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'INDEXED' is performance-sensitive. The code context provided contains performance-related operations that directly affect system performance at the system level. The 'INDEXED' configuration involves operations such as handling indexed images, setting physical dimensions, and writing images, which are time-expensive and memory-expensive operations. These operations can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, making the 'INDEXED' configuration performance-sensitive."
