    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'WIDTH' is performance-sensitive. The 'WIDTH' configuration directly affects the system performance at the system level by adjusting the image size based on hints and maximum size constraints. The 'setImageSize' method modifies global variables 'width' and 'height' which are crucial for determining the size of the image. This adjustment can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, making the 'WIDTH' configuration performance-sensitive."
