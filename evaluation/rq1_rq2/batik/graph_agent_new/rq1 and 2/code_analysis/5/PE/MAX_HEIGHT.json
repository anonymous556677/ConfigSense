    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option MAX_HEIGHT is performance-sensitive. The code snippet provided shows that the MAX_HEIGHT configuration directly affects the image size computation within the setImageSize method. Depending on the values of imgMaxHeight and imgMaxWidth, the height and width of the image are adjusted accordingly, potentially leading to notable performance variations at the system level. The computation of image size based on MAX_HEIGHT involves time-expensive operations that can impact system performance significantly."
