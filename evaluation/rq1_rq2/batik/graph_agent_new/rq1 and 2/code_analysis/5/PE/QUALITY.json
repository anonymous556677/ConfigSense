    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'QUALITY' is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the 'QUALITY' configuration directly affects the performance of the system at the system level. The code snippet provided shows that the 'QUALITY' configuration determines the quality of the image output, which can have a significant impact on the execution time and memory consumption. The 'quality' parameter is used to set the JPEG quality, which can result in notable performance variations based on the quality value. Therefore, the 'QUALITY' configuration is considered performance-sensitive."
