    "Reason": "The configuration option MAX_WIDTH is not performance-sensitive. The code snippet related to MAX_WIDTH does not involve any performance-intensive operations that would lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The computation of image width and height based on hints and the limitation of image size based on maximum width and height do not have a significant impact on system performance."
