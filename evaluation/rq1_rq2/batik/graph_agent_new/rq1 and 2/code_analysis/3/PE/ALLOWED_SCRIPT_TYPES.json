    "Reason": "The configuration option ALLOWED_SCRIPT_TYPES is not performance-sensitive. The code context provided shows that this configuration is used to build a list of allowed script types for the <script> element, which involves basic string manipulation operations like tokenizing and adding to a list. These operations are not time-expensive or memory-expensive and do not lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
