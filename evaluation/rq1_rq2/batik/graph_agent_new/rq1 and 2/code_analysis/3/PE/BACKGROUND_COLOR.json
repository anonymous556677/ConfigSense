    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option BACKGROUND_COLOR is performance-sensitive. The code snippet related to this configuration involves time-expensive operations such as setting the background color of the image using Graphics2D. This operation directly affects the rendering process and can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, especially when handling large images. Therefore, the configuration is considered performance-sensitive based on the significant impact it has on system performance."
