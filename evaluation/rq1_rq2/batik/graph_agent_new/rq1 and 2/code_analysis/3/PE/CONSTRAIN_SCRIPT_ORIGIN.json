    "Reason": "The configuration option CONSTRAIN_SCRIPT_ORIGIN is not performance-sensitive. The code snippet related to this configuration does not contain any performance-related operations that are time-expensive or memory-expensive. The configuration only determines whether to apply a certain script security setting based on the value of KEY_CONSTRAIN_SCRIPT_ORIGIN in the hints map. This configuration does not directly and substantially affect system performance at the system level, and the code related to it does not lead to notable performance variations."
