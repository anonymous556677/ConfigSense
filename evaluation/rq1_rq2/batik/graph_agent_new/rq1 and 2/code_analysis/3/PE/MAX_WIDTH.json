    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The configuration option MAX_WIDTH is not performance-sensitive. The code snippet related to MAX_WIDTH does not involve any time-expensive or memory-expensive operations that would lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The computation of image width and height based on hints and the limitation of image size do not directly and substantially affect system performance, therefore the configuration is not considered performance-sensitive."
