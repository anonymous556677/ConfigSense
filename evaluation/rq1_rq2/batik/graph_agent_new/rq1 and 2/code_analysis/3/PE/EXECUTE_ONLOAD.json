    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option EXECUTE_ONLOAD is performance-sensitive. The code snippet related to this configuration involves time-expensive and memory-expensive operations that directly impact system performance at the system level. The configuration involves operations such as building the GVT tree, dispatching onload events, loading scripts, and setting viewing transforms, which contribute significantly to execution time and memory consumption. Additionally, the configuration directly affects the dynamic state of the document, indicating a substantial impact on system performance. Therefore, based on the code context and the operations performed by the configuration, it is classified as performance-sensitive."
