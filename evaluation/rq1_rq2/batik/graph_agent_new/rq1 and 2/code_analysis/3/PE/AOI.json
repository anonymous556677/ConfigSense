    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'AOI' is performance-sensitive. The 'AOI' configuration involves performance-related operations that are time-expensive within its related code. Specifically, the 'setImageSize' method modifies global variables 'width' and 'height' based on hints, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The 'setImageSize' method checks if scaling is needed based on the 'KEY_SCALE_TO_PAGE' hint and adjusts the image size accordingly, impacting performance. Additionally, the 'transcode' method performs operations such as building the GVT tree, dispatching events, and computing matrices, which are time-expensive operations. These operations directly and substantially affect system performance, making the 'AOI' configuration performance-sensitive."
