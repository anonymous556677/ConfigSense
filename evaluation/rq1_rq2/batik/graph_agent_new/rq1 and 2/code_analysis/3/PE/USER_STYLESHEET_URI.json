    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The configuration option USER_STYLESHEET_URI is not performance-sensitive. The code snippet provided simply retrieves the user stylesheet URI from the TranscodingHints and returns it, or null if not found. There are no time-expensive or memory-expensive operations involved in this configuration-related code. Additionally, the unclear method getUserStyleSheetURI does not provide any implementation details or logic related to performance-sensitive operations. Therefore, the configuration is not classified as performance-sensitive."
