{
    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'SNAPSHOT_TIME' is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the 'KEY_SNAPSHOT_TIME' configuration parameter directly influences the current time of the animation engine, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The code snippet related to 'KEY_SNAPSHOT_TIME' involves time-expensive operations such as setting the current time of the animation engine based on the value of 'KEY_SNAPSHOT_TIME', which can have a significant impact on the overall performance of the system."
