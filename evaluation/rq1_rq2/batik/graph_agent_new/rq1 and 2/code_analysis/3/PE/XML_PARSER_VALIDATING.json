    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'XML_PARSER_VALIDATING' is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the 'XML_PARSER_VALIDATING' configuration directly affects the performance of the system at the system level. The code snippet related to this configuration involves time-expensive operations such as parsing the XML document and setting validation mode for the XML parser. These operations can lead to notable performance variations in the system, making the configuration performance-sensitive."
