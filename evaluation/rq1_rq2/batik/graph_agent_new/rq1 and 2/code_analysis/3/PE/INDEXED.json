    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'INDEXED' is performance-sensitive. The code context provided shows that the configuration directly affects the image encoding process, which involves time-expensive operations such as setting physical dimensions, generating gamma and chroma chunks, and writing the image to an output stream. These operations can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, making the 'INDEXED' configuration performance-sensitive."
