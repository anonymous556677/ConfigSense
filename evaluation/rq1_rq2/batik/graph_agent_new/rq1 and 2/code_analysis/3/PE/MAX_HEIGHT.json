    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option MAX_HEIGHT is performance-sensitive. The code snippet provided shows that the MAX_HEIGHT configuration directly affects the image size computation within the setImageSize method. If the image height exceeds the specified MAX_HEIGHT, it triggers additional computations to resize the image, impacting both time and memory consumption. This directly influences the system performance at the system level, making it performance-sensitive."
