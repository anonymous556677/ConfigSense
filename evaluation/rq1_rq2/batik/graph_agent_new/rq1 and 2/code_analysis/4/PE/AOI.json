    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'AOI' is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the 'AOI' configuration involves performance-related operations that are time-expensive within its related code. Specifically, the 'AOI' configuration computes the preserveAspectRatio matrix, transforms the AOI into the image's coordinate system, and applies transformations based on width, height, and scale. These operations directly impact the system performance at the system level by significantly affecting the rendering and transformation processes of SVG documents, leading to notable performance variations."
