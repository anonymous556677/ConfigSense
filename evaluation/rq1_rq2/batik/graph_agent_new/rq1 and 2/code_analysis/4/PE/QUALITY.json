    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'QUALITY' is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the 'QUALITY' configuration directly affects the performance of the system at the system level. The code snippet provided shows that the 'QUALITY' configuration is used to set the JPEG quality when writing an image. The quality of the image directly impacts the execution time and memory consumption, leading to notable performance variations at the system level. Therefore, the 'QUALITY' configuration is considered performance-sensitive."
