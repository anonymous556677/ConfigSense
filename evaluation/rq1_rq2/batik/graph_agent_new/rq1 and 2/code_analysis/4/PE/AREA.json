    "Reason": "The configuration option 'AREA' is not performance-sensitive based on the provided code context. The 'AREA' configuration involves setting the document size according to hints provided, which does not involve any time-expensive or memory-expensive operations that would lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The code snippets related to 'AREA' configuration do not directly and substantially affect system performance, and the operations performed are not time-extensive or memory-extensive within its related code."
