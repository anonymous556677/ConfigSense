    "Reason": "The configuration option ALTERNATE_STYLESHEET is not performance-sensitive. The code snippet provided is a simple method that retrieves the alternate style-sheet title based on a key from a map. This operation is not time-expensive or memory-expensive, and it does not directly and substantially affect system performance at the system level. Therefore, it does not lead to notable performance variations and should be classified as not performance-sensitive."
