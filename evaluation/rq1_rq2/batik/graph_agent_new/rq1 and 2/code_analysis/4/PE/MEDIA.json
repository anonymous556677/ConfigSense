    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'MEDIA' does not appear to be performance-sensitive based on the provided code context. The getMedia() method simply returns a hardcoded value 'all' without any performance-intensive operations or notable performance variations at the system level. Additionally, the code does not seem to be directly related to any configuration data, further indicating that it is not performance-sensitive."
