    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'WIDTH' is performance-sensitive. The 'WIDTH' configuration directly affects the image size computation in the 'setImageSize' method. The method calculates and adjusts the width and height of the image based on hints and maximum size constraints. This computation involves mathematical operations that can be time-expensive and memory-expensive, especially when dealing with large documents or images. Therefore, any changes or variations in the 'WIDTH' configuration can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, making it performance-sensitive."
