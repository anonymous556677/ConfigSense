    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option MAX_HEIGHT is performance-sensitive. The code snippet provided shows that the MAX_HEIGHT configuration directly affects the system performance by limiting the image size based on the maximum height hint. This operation is time-expensive and memory-expensive as it involves calculations to adjust the image size accordingly. These calculations can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, making the MAX_HEIGHT configuration performance-sensitive."
