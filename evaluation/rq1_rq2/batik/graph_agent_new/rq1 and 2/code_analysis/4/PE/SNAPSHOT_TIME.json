    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'SNAPSHOT_TIME' is not performance-sensitive based on the provided code context. The 'SNAPSHOT_TIME' configuration is used to set the current time for the animation engine, which is a specific operation within the transcoding process. While this operation may have some impact on the performance of the transcoding process, it does not directly and substantially affect system performance at the system level. The code related to 'SNAPSHOT_TIME' configuration does not involve any time-expensive or memory-expensive operations that would lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Therefore, the 'SNAPSHOT_TIME' configuration is classified as not performance-sensitive."
