    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The configuration option CONSTRAIN_SCRIPT_ORIGIN is not performance-sensitive. The code snippet related to this configuration involves checking a boolean value (constrainOrigin) and based on its value, it returns different ScriptSecurity objects. This configuration does not involve any time-expensive or memory-expensive operations that would lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The configuration simply determines whether to use DefaultScriptSecurity or RelaxedScriptSecurity based on the value of constrainOrigin, which does not have a substantial impact on system performance."
