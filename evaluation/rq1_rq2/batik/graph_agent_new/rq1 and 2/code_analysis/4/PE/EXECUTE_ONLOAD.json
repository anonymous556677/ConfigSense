    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option EXECUTE_ONLOAD is performance-sensitive. The code context provided contains operations that directly impact system performance at the system level. The presence of time-expensive and memory-expensive operations, such as building the GVT tree, dispatching onload events, and computing the preserveAspectRatio matrix, can lead to notable performance variations. Additionally, the configuration involves the execution of dynamic scripts and animation, which further contribute to performance sensitivity. Therefore, based on the code analysis, the configuration is classified as performance-sensitive."
