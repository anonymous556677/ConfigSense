    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The configuration option MAX_WIDTH is not performance-sensitive. The code snippet related to MAX_WIDTH does not involve any performance-related operations that are time-expensive or memory-expensive. The computation of image width and height based on hints does not have a significant impact on system performance. The MAX_WIDTH configuration is used to limit the image size, but the operations related to it do not lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
