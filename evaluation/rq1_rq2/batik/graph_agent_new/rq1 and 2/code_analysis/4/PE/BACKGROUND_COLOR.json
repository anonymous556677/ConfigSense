    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option BACKGROUND_COLOR is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the code snippet related to the configuration involves time-expensive and memory-expensive operations. Specifically, setting the background color involves painting the image, which can have a notable performance impact at the system level. The use of Graphics2D to fill the background color and draw the rendered image can contribute significantly to execution time and memory consumption, leading to notable performance variations."
