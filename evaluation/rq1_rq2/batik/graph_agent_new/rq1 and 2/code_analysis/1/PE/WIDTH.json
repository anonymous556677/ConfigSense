    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'WIDTH' is performance-sensitive. The 'WIDTH' configuration directly affects the system performance at the system level by determining the width and height of the output image. The 'setImageSize' method modifies the global variables 'width' and 'height' based on hints, which can lead to notable performance variations. Additionally, the 'transcode' method involves performance-related operations such as computing the preserveAspectRatio matrix and setting the size and viewBox on the output document, which are time-expensive and memory-expensive operations. Therefore, the 'WIDTH' configuration is considered performance-sensitive."
