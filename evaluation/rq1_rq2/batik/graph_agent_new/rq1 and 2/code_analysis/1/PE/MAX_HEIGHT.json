    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option MAX_HEIGHT is performance-sensitive. The code snippet provided shows that the MAX_HEIGHT configuration directly affects the image size computation within the setImageSize method. If the image height exceeds the specified MAX_HEIGHT, it triggers additional calculations to adjust the width and height accordingly. These additional calculations can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, making the MAX_HEIGHT configuration performance-sensitive."
