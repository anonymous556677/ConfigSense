    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The configuration option MAX_WIDTH is not performance-sensitive. The code snippet related to MAX_WIDTH involves basic arithmetic operations to limit the image size based on the maximum width hints. These operations are not time-expensive or memory-expensive and do not lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Therefore, the MAX_WIDTH configuration does not have a significant impact on system performance."
