    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option EXECUTE_ONLOAD is performance-sensitive. The code snippet contains operations that directly impact system performance at the system level. Specifically, the 'KEY_EXECUTE_ONLOAD' flag is used to determine if the document is dynamic, which triggers the building of the GVT tree and dispatching of an 'onload' event. These operations are time-expensive and memory-expensive, leading to notable performance variations. Additionally, the configuration involves handling of 'width' and 'height' attributes, as well as transformations based on 'AOI' and 'viewBox', all of which contribute to performance impact at the system level."
