    "Reason": "The configuration option DEFAULT_FONT_FAMILY is not performance-sensitive. The code snippet provided simply returns a hardcoded font family 'Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif' without utilizing any configuration settings or parameters. This code does not involve any performance-related operations that are time-expensive or memory-expensive, and therefore does not lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
