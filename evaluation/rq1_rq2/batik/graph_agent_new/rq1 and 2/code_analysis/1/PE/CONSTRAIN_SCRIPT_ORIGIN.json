    "Reason": "The configuration option CONSTRAIN_SCRIPT_ORIGIN is not performance-sensitive. The code snippet related to this configuration involves checking a boolean value (constrainOrigin) and returning different ScriptSecurity objects based on its value. This configuration does not involve any time-expensive or memory-expensive operations that would lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Additionally, the unclear code snippet related to the computeAllowedScripts method is a helper method for building a list of allowed script types, which does not directly impact system performance significantly."
