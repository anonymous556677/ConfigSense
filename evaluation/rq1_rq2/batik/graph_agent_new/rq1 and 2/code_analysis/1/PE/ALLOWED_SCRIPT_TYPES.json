    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The configuration option ALLOWED_SCRIPT_TYPES is not performance-sensitive. The code context provided shows that this configuration is used to build a list of allowed script types for the <script> element, which involves simple string manipulation operations. These operations are not time-expensive or memory-expensive, and they do not lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Therefore, the configuration does not directly and substantially affect system performance, making it non-performance-sensitive."
