{
    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'SNAPSHOT_TIME' is performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the 'KEY_SNAPSHOT_TIME' configuration involves time-extensive operations within the related code. Specifically, the code snippet 'ctx.getAnimationEngine().setCurrentTime(t);' is time-expensive and directly affects system performance at the system level by setting the current time for the animation engine. This operation can lead to notable performance variations, making the 'SNAPSHOT_TIME' configuration performance-sensitive."
