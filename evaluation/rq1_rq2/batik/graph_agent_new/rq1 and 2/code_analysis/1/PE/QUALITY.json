    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The QUALITY configuration option is performance-sensitive. This is because the code snippet related to the QUALITY configuration involves performance-related operations that are time-expensive, such as setting the JPEG quality and resolution parameters. These operations directly impact the execution time and memory consumption of the system at the system level, leading to notable performance variations. Additionally, the QUALITY configuration directly affects the output image quality, which can have a significant impact on the overall performance of the system."
