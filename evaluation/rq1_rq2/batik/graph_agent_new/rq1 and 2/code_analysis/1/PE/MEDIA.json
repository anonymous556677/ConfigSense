    "Reason": "The configuration option 'MEDIA' is not performance-sensitive. The code snippet provided for the 'MEDIA' configuration does not involve any performance-related operations that are time-expensive or memory-expensive. The method getMedia() simply returns a hardcoded value 'all' without any complex logic or performance impact. Therefore, it does not lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
