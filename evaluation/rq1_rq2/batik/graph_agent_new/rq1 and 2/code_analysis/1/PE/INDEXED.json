    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'INDEXED' is not performance-sensitive. The code context related to the 'INDEXED' configuration does not contain any performance-related operations that are time-expensive or memory-expensive. The configuration-related code mainly deals with image encoding and writing operations, which do not directly and substantially affect system performance at the system level. Therefore, based on the analysis of the code context, the 'INDEXED' configuration is classified as not performance-sensitive."
