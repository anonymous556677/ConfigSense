    "Reason": "The configuration option ALTERNATE_STYLESHEET is not performance-sensitive. The code snippet provided for the getAlternateStyleSheet method does not contain any performance-related operations that are time-expensive or memory-expensive. The method simply returns a value from hints or falls back to a default value, which does not have a notable impact on system performance. Additionally, the method does not seem to be directly related to any configuration settings, as it does not retrieve or set any configuration values."
