    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'WIDTH' is performance-sensitive because it directly affects the size of the output image, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Changing the width of the image will impact the computation of the image size, transformation matrices, and the overall transcoding process, which are time-expensive operations. The code snippet related to the 'WIDTH' configuration involves computations and transformations based on the width value, indicating that it contributes significantly to the execution time and memory consumption of the transcoding process."
