    "Reason": "The DESTINATION_TYPE configuration is performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly affects the type of destination file to be created during the conversion process, which has a significant impact on the final result of the conversion and the file format of the output. The code snippets related to the configuration involve operations that are time-expensive, such as setting the transcoder and computing transcoding hints, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
