    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The configuration option CONSTRAIN_SCRIPT_ORIGIN does not directly involve any time-expensive or memory-expensive operations within its related code. It simply determines whether to constrain the origin of a script or not, based on the developer's understanding. The configuration does not lead to notable performance variations at the system level, as it primarily deals with security settings for scripts. Therefore, it is classified as not performance-sensitive."
