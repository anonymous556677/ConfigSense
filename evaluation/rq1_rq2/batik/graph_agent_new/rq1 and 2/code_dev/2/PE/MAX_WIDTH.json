    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The MAX_WIDTH configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly affects the system performance by limiting the width of images. The code snippet related to the MAX_WIDTH configuration involves time-expensive operations such as computing and adjusting image width and height based on the specified maximum width. This can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, especially when processing a large number of images with varying sizes. Therefore, the MAX_WIDTH configuration is considered performance-sensitive."
