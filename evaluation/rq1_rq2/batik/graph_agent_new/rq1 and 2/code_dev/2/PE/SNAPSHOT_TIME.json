    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The 'SNAPSHOT_TIME' configuration option is not performance-sensitive based on the provided code context and developer information. Although it involves setting the current time for the animation engine, this operation does not directly and substantially affect system performance at the system level. The code related to 'SNAPSHOT_TIME' mainly focuses on handling time-based animations and interactions within the SVG document, which does not lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
