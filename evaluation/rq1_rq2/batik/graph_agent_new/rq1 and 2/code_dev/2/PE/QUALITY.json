    "Reason": "The configuration option 'QUALITY' in the provided code context does not directly and substantially affect system performance at the system level. Although setting the quality of the JPEG image may impact the size and quality of the image, it does not lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The code snippet related to setting the quality of the image does not contain any time-expensive or memory-expensive operations that would significantly impact system performance."
