    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'EXECUTE_ONLOAD' is performance-sensitive. This is because the 'isDynamic' flag is set based on the value of 'KEY_EXECUTE_ONLOAD', which determines if the document is dynamic and triggers the dispatch of an 'onload' event if needed. This dynamic behavior directly impacts the execution time and memory consumption at the system level, leading to notable performance variations. Additionally, the code snippet related to handling the 'EXECUTE_ONLOAD' configuration involves time-expensive operations such as building the GVT tree and dispatching events, which further confirms its performance sensitivity."
