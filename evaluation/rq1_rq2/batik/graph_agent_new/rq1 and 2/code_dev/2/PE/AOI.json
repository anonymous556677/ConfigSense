    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'AOI' configuration option is classified as performance-sensitive. This is because the 'AOI' configuration directly affects the system performance by performing time-expensive and memory-expensive operations within the 'transcode' method. The code snippet related to the 'AOI' configuration involves calculations for scaling and transforming the Area of Interest, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Additionally, the 'transcode' method is a critical part of the program that is called frequently, making the performance impact of the 'AOI' configuration significant."
