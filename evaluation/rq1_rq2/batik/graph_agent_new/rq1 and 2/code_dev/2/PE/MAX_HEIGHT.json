    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The MAX_HEIGHT configuration option is performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly affects the system performance by limiting the height of images, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The code snippet related to the MAX_HEIGHT configuration involves time-expensive operations such as resizing images based on the specified maximum height, which can impact the overall execution time and memory consumption of the system."
