    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The BACKGROUND_COLOR configuration option in the provided code context does not involve any performance-sensitive operations that significantly impact system performance at the system level. The code snippet related to setting the background color of the image does not contribute significantly to execution time or memory consumption. While the configuration may affect the visual appearance of the transcoded image, it does not lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Therefore, based on the code analysis, the configuration is classified as not performance-sensitive."
