    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'INDEXED' configuration option is performance-sensitive because it directly affects the color depth and size of the image, leading to notable performance variations at the system level. The code snippet related to the 'INDEXED' configuration performs operations that are time-expensive, such as converting the image to an indexed image based on the specified color depth values. This operation can have a significant impact on memory consumption and execution time, making the configuration performance-sensitive."
