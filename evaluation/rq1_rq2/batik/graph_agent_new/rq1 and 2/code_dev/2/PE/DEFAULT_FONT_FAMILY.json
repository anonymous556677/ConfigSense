    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The DEFAULT_FONT_FAMILY configuration option is not performance-sensitive. The code snippet provided simply retrieves the default font family from hints and falls back to the super class method if not set. This operation is minimal and does not have a significant impact on system performance. Additionally, the developer's understanding that the configuration option has minimal impact on size further supports the classification as not performance-sensitive."
