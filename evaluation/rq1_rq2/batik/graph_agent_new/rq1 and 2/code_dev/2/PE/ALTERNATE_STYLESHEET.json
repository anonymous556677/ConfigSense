    "Reason": "The ALTERNATE_STYLESHEET configuration option is not performance-sensitive. The code snippet provided does not contain any performance-intensive operations that would lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The configuration simply retrieves the alternate style-sheet title from the hints map or falls back to the super class method if not found, which does not have a significant impact on system performance."
