    "Reason": "The 'ALLOWED_SCRIPT_TYPES' configuration option is not performance-sensitive. The code snippet provided is focused on building a list of allowed values for the <script> element's type attribute based on the hints provided. This operation does not involve any time-expensive or memory-expensive tasks that would lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The configuration is more related to security and functionality considerations rather than performance impacts."
