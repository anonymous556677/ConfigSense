    "Reason": "The USER_STYLESHEET_URI configuration option is not performance-sensitive. The code snippet provided simply retrieves the user stylesheet URI specified in the TranscodingHints and falls back to the superclass method if not found. This operation is not time-expensive or memory-expensive, and it has a limited impact on the overall system performance. Therefore, it does not lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
