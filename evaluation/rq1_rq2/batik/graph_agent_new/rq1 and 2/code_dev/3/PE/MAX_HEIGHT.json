    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The MAX_HEIGHT configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly affects the system performance by limiting the height of an image based on the specified maximum height. This involves time-expensive operations such as computing and adjusting the height of the image to fit within the maximum height while maintaining the aspect ratio. These operations can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, making the configuration performance-sensitive."
