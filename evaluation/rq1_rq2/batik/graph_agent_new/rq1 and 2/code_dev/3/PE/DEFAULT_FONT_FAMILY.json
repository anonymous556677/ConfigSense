    "Reason": "The DEFAULT_FONT_FAMILY configuration option is not performance-sensitive. The code snippet provided simply retrieves the default font family from a map of hints and falls back to the superclass method if not found. This operation is not time-expensive or memory-expensive, and changing the default font family only affects the look and feel of the text in the application, which is a trivial impact on system performance."
