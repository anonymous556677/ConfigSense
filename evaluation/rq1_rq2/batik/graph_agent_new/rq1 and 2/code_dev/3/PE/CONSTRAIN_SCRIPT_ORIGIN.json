    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The configuration option CONSTRAIN_SCRIPT_ORIGIN is not performance-sensitive based on the provided code context and developer information. The configuration mainly deals with determining whether to constrain the origin of a script or not, which does not involve any time-expensive or memory-expensive operations. The configuration directly affects security settings for scripts, but it does not lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Therefore, it is classified as not performance-sensitive."
