    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'HEIGHT' is performance-sensitive because it directly affects the size of the image being transcoded, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The code snippet related to the 'HEIGHT' configuration involves operations that are time-expensive, such as computing the preserveAspectRatio matrix and setting the image size based on the height. These operations can have a significant impact on the execution time and memory consumption of the system, making the 'HEIGHT' configuration performance-sensitive."
