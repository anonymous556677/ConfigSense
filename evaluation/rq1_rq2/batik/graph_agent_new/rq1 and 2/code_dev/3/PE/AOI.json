    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'AOI' configuration option is considered performance-sensitive. The reason for this classification is that the 'AOI' configuration directly affects the size and position of the resulting image by applying scaling and translation transformations. These operations are time-expensive and memory-expensive within the related code context, leading to notable performance variations at the system level. The configuration involves performance-related operations that have a substantial impact on system performance, making it performance-sensitive."
