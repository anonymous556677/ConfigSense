    "Reason": "The ALTERNATE_STYLESHEET configuration option is not performance-sensitive. The code snippet provided for the configuration is simple and does not involve any time-expensive or memory-expensive operations. The developer's understanding also confirms that the impact of this configuration on system performance is minimal, as it only affects the style-sheet title for the user agent. Therefore, this configuration does not lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
