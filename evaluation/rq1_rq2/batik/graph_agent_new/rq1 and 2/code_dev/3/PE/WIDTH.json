    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The 'WIDTH' configuration option is not performance-sensitive. Although it is used to determine the width of the output image and is checked multiple times in the code, it does not directly and substantially affect system performance at the system level. The code related to the 'WIDTH' configuration does not contain any time-expensive or memory-expensive operations that would lead to notable performance variations. Therefore, the 'WIDTH' configuration is not considered performance-sensitive."
