    "Reason": "The MAX_WIDTH configuration option does not directly involve any time-expensive or memory-expensive operations within its related code. It simply checks if the hints contain a MAX_WIDTH value and restricts the width of the image accordingly. This operation does not lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Therefore, the configuration is not performance-sensitive."
