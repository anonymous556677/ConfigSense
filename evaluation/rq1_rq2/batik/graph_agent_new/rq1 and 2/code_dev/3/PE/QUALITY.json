    "Reason": "The 'QUALITY' configuration option is not performance-sensitive based on the provided code context and developer information. Although the configuration affects the quality and size of the image being written, it does not directly and substantially impact system performance at the system level. The code snippet related to the 'QUALITY' configuration does not contain any time-expensive or memory-expensive operations that would lead to notable performance variations. Additionally, the configuration is only triggered when the writeImage method is called, which may not be frequent enough to cause significant performance impacts."
