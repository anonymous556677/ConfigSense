    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The DESTINATION_TYPE configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly affects the type of destination file to be created during the conversion process, which can have a notable impact on system performance. The code snippets related to the configuration involve operations that are time-expensive, such as setting the transcoder based on the destination type and modifying the result filename. These operations can lead to significant performance variations at the system level, making the configuration performance-sensitive."
