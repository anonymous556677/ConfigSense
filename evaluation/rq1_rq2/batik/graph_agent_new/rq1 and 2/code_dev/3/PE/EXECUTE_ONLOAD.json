    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'EXECUTE_ONLOAD' configuration option is performance-sensitive. This is because it directly impacts the behavior of the transcoding process by determining if scripts need to be loaded and if an 'onload' event needs to be dispatched. These operations can be time-expensive and memory-expensive, leading to notable performance variations at the system level. The code snippet related to this configuration involves building the GVT tree, dispatching events, and handling document size, all of which can significantly affect system performance."
