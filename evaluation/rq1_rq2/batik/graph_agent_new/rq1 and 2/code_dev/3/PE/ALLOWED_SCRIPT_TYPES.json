    "Reason": "The 'ALLOWED_SCRIPT_TYPES' configuration option is not performance-sensitive. The code snippet provided is focused on building a list of allowed script types based on the hints provided. This operation does not involve any time-expensive or memory-expensive tasks that would significantly impact system performance. Additionally, the purpose of this configuration is to enhance security by restricting script types, which is not directly related to system performance."
