    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'ALLOWED_SCRIPT_TYPES' does not directly involve any performance-related operations that are time-expensive or memory-expensive within its related code. The code snippet provided is focused on building a list of allowed script types based on the configured value, which does not lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The configuration's purpose is to restrict the types of scripts that can be executed for security reasons, rather than impacting system performance significantly."
