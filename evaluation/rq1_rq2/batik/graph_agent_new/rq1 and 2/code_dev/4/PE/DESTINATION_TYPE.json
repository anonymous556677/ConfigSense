    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The DESTINATION_TYPE configuration is performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly affects the type of destination file to be created during the conversion process, which can have a significant impact on the overall system performance. The code related to the DESTINATION_TYPE configuration involves operations that are time-expensive, such as setting the transcoder to use for the operation and modifying the result filename. These operations can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, making the configuration performance-sensitive."
