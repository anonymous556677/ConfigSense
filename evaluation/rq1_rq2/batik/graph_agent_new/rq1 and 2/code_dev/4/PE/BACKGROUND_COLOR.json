    "Reason": "The 'BACKGROUND_COLOR' configuration option is not performance-sensitive based on the provided code context and developer information. Although it affects the visual appearance of the transcoded image by setting the background color, it does not involve any time-expensive or memory-expensive operations that would lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The code snippet related to setting the background color is straightforward and does not contribute significantly to the overall system performance."
