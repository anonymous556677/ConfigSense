    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'AOI' configuration option is considered performance-sensitive. This is because the 'AOI' configuration involves performance-related operations that are time-expensive within its related code. The transformation of the AOI into the image's coordinate system and the subsequent adjustment of the output image size based on the specified AOI can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The use of AffineTransform and Rectangle2D classes for these operations can consume significant memory and processing resources, impacting the overall performance of the transcoding process."
