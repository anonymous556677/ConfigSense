    "Reason": "The configuration option PIXEL_UNIT_TO_MILLIMETER is not performance-sensitive. The code snippet provided simply retrieves a conversion factor from TranscodingHints or returns a default value if not specified. This operation is not time-expensive or memory-expensive, and it does not lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Therefore, the configuration can be considered trivial in terms of performance impact."
