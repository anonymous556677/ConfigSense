    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The WIDTH configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly affects the size of the output image, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The code snippet related to the WIDTH configuration involves calculations to adjust the width and height of the image based on the specified width value. This resizing operation can be time-expensive and memory-expensive, especially when dealing with large images, leading to significant performance impacts. Therefore, the WIDTH configuration is considered performance-sensitive."
