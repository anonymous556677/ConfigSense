    "Reason": "The configuration option 'QUALITY' is not performance-sensitive. Although it affects the size and quality of the JPEG images written to the output, setting the quality value does not directly and substantially impact system performance at the system level. The code snippet related to the 'QUALITY' configuration involves setting the quality of the image, which is a necessary operation for image processing but does not lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Therefore, the 'QUALITY' configuration is not considered performance-sensitive."
