    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The SNAPSHOT_TIME configuration option is performance-sensitive. This is because setting the snapshot time directly impacts the animation engine's current time, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The code related to the configuration involves checking for the KEY_SNAPSHOT_TIME in the hints and setting the current time of the animation engine accordingly. This operation can be time-expensive and memory-expensive, especially when dealing with dynamic documents and triggering the configuration on 'onload' events. Therefore, the configuration is considered performance-sensitive."
