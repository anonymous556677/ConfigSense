    "Reason": "The DEFAULT_FONT_FAMILY configuration option is not performance-sensitive. The code snippet provided simply retrieves the default font family from a map of hints and falls back to the superclass method if the font family is not found. This operation is not time-expensive or memory-expensive, and it has a limited impact on the overall system performance. Additionally, the developer's understanding confirms that the configuration option does not have a significant impact on system performance or behavior."
