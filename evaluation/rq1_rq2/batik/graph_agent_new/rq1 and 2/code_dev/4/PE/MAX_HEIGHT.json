    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The MAX_HEIGHT configuration option is performance-sensitive because it directly affects the system performance by limiting the height of images. The setImageSize method, which includes the logic for adjusting image size based on hints and limiting height to MAX_HEIGHT, involves time-expensive operations such as calculations and comparisons that can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Additionally, resizing images frequently with this configuration can impact the overall performance of the system, making it a performance-sensitive configuration."
