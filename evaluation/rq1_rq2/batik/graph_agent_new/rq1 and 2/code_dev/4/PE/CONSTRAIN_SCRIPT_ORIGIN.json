    "Reason": "The CONSTRAIN_SCRIPT_ORIGIN configuration option does not directly involve any performance-related operations that are time-expensive or memory-expensive within its related code. It simply determines whether to constrain the origin of a script or not, which does not lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The configuration's impact is focused on security measures rather than performance optimization."
