    "Reason": "The configuration option 'USER_STYLESHEET_URI' is not performance-sensitive. The code snippet provided simply retrieves the user stylesheet URI from TranscodingHints or falls back to the superclass method if not found. This operation is minimal and does not have a significant impact on system performance. The configuration does not involve any time-expensive or memory-expensive operations that would lead to notable performance variations at the system level."
