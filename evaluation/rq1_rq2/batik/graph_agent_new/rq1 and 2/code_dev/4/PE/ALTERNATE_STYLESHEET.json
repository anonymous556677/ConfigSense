    "Reason": "The ALTERNATE_STYLESHEET configuration option is not performance-sensitive. The code snippet provided is a simple method that retrieves the alternate style-sheet title from the hints map or falls back to the superclass method if not found. This operation is not time-expensive or memory-expensive and does not lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The developer's understanding also confirms that the impact of this configuration option is minimal and only affects the user agent's alternate style-sheet title."
