    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The MAX_WIDTH configuration option does not directly involve any performance-related operations that are time-expensive or memory-expensive within its related code. It simply checks and adjusts the width and height of an image based on the maximum width specified in the hints. This operation is not significantly time-consuming or memory-intensive, and therefore does not lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The configuration is more focused on maintaining the layout and design of the document or image being processed, rather than impacting system performance."
