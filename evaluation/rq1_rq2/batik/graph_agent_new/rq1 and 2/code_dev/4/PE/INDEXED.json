    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'INDEXED' in the provided code context does not directly involve any time-expensive or memory-expensive operations. The code mainly checks for the presence of 'KEY_INDEXED' in the hints and performs operations on the BufferedImage based on the value. These operations are not significantly time-consuming or memory-intensive to cause notable performance variations at the system level. Therefore, the configuration can be classified as not performance-sensitive."
