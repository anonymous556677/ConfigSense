    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The HEIGHT configuration option is performance-sensitive. This is because the height of the image being transcoded directly impacts the size of the output image, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The code snippet related to the configuration shows that the HEIGHT value is used extensively in calculations to determine the final image dimensions. Any changes in the HEIGHT configuration can result in significant performance impacts due to the computations involved in adjusting the image size accordingly."
