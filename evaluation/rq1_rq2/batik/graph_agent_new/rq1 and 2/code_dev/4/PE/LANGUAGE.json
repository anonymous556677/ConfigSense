    "Reason": "The configuration option 'LANGUAGE' is not performance-sensitive. The code snippet provided is a simple method that retrieves the user language specified in the TranscodingHints or falls back to the default language 'en'. This operation is not time-expensive or memory-expensive and does not lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The configuration only impacts the language setting for transcoding and does not have a significant impact on overall system performance or size."
