    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The configuration option 'SNAPSHOT_TIME' is performance-sensitive. This is because the 'SNAPSHOT_TIME' hint directly affects the current time for the animation engine, which can have a significant impact on the playback of animations in the SVG document. The code snippet related to the 'SNAPSHOT_TIME' configuration involves time-expensive operations such as setting the current time for the animation engine based on the hint value. This operation can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, making it a performance-sensitive configuration."
