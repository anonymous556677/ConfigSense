    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The MAX_HEIGHT configuration option is performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration directly affects the system performance by limiting the height of images processed in the setImageSize method. The code snippet related to the MAX_HEIGHT configuration involves time-expensive operations such as adjusting the width and height of the image based on the specified maximum height. These operations can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, making the configuration performance-sensitive."
