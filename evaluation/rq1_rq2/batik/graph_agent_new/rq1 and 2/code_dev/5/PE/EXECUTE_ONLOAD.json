    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'EXECUTE_ONLOAD' configuration option is performance-sensitive. This is because it directly affects the dynamic behavior of the document and the dispatching of 'onload' events, which can lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The code related to this configuration involves building the GVT tree, setting dynamic states, loading scripts, and dispatching events, all of which are time-expensive and memory-expensive operations. Therefore, the configuration is considered performance-sensitive based on its impact on system performance and the nature of the code related to it."
