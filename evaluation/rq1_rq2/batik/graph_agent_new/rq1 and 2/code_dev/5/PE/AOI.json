{
    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'AOI' configuration option is classified as performance-sensitive because it directly impacts the system performance at the system level. The code related to the 'AOI' configuration involves time-expensive and memory-expensive operations such as calculating transformation matrices, scaling, and translating the specified area of interest within the SVG document. These operations can lead to notable performance variations in terms of execution time and memory consumption. Additionally, the 'AOI' configuration is triggered based on the presence of the 'KEY_AOI' hint in the hints map, indicating that it can be frequently triggered depending on the system usage. Overall, the 'AOI' configuration has a substantial impact on system performance, making it performance-sensitive."
