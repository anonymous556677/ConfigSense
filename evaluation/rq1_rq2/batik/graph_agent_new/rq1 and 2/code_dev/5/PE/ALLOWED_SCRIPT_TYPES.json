    "Reason": "The configuration option 'ALLOWED_SCRIPT_TYPES' is not performance-sensitive. The code snippet provided is responsible for building a list of allowed values for the <script> element's type attribute. This operation is limited to processing transcoding operations that involve <script> elements, and it does not involve any time-expensive or memory-expensive operations that would lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Therefore, the configuration has a trivial performance impact and should not be considered performance-sensitive."
