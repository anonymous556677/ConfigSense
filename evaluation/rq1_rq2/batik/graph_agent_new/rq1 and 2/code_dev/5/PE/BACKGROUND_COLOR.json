    "Reason": "The configuration option BACKGROUND_COLOR is not performance-sensitive based on the provided code context and developer information. While setting the background color of the transcoded image may impact the visual appearance of the output, it does not involve any time-expensive or memory-expensive operations that would lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The code snippet related to handling the background color is straightforward and does not introduce significant performance overhead."
