    "Reason": "The DEFAULT_FONT_FAMILY configuration option is not performance-sensitive. The code snippet provided simply returns the default font family, and the configuration only affects the font family used in the system. Since it does not involve any time-expensive or memory-expensive operations, and it does not lead to notable performance variations at the system level, it is considered to have a minimal performance impact."
