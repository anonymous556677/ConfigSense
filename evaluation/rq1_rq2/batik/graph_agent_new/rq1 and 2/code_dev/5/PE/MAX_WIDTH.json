    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The MAX_WIDTH configuration is performance-sensitive because it directly affects the system performance by limiting the width of images. The code snippet related to the MAX_WIDTH configuration involves time-expensive operations such as computing and adjusting image width and height based on the maximum width hints. These operations can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, especially when processing multiple images with varying sizes. Therefore, the MAX_WIDTH configuration is considered performance-sensitive."
