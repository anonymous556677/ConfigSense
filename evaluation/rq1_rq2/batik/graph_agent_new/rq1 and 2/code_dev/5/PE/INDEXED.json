    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The INDEXED configuration option is not performance-sensitive based on the provided code context. The operations related to the INDEXED key involve basic checks and transformations on the BufferedImage based on the value associated with the key. These operations do not involve any time-expensive or memory-expensive processes that would lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Therefore, the configuration can be considered to have a trivial performance impact."
