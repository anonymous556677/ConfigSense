    "Reason": "The configuration option CONSTRAIN_SCRIPT_ORIGIN is not performance-sensitive. The code snippet related to this configuration does not contain any performance-intensive operations that would lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The configuration simply determines whether to constrain the origin of a script or not, which does not directly and substantially affect system performance in a significant way."
