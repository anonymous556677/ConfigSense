    "Reason": "The configuration option 'QUALITY' is not considered performance-sensitive based on the provided code context and developer's information. Although the configuration sets the quality of the image output, it does not involve any time-expensive or memory-expensive operations that would lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The code primarily deals with setting the JPEG quality based on the specified hints or default value, which does not have a significant impact on system performance."
