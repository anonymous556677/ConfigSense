    "Reason": "The USER_STYLESHEET_URI configuration option is not performance-sensitive. The code snippet provided simply retrieves the user stylesheet URI specified in the TranscodingHints. This operation is not time-expensive or memory-expensive, and it does not lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The developer's information also confirms that the impact of this configuration is limited to the retrieval of the user stylesheet URI and does not have a significant impact on the overall system performance."
