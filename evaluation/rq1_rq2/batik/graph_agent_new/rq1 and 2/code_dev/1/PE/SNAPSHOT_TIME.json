    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'SNAPSHOT_TIME' configuration option is classified as performance-sensitive. This classification is based on the fact that setting the current time for the animation engine during the transcoding process can directly impact the rendering of animated elements in the SVG document. The code snippet related to the 'SNAPSHOT_TIME' configuration involves time-expensive operations such as setting the current time for the animation engine based on hints provided. This can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, making it a performance-sensitive configuration."
