    "Reason": "The MAX_WIDTH configuration option does not directly and substantially affect system performance at the system level. The code snippet provided shows that the MAX_WIDTH configuration is used to limit the width of an image based on the hints provided. While this may have an impact on the size of images in the system, it does not involve any time-expensive or memory-expensive operations that would lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Therefore, the configuration is not considered performance-sensitive."
