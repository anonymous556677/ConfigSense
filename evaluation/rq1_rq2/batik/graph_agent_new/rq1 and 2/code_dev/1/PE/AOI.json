    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'AOI' configuration option is performance-sensitive. This is because the configuration involves significant performance-related operations within its related code. The transformation of the AOI into the image's coordinate system and the application of scaling factors based on the AOI can be time-expensive and memory-expensive operations. These operations directly impact the system performance at the system level by modifying the image size and potentially causing notable performance variations during the transcoding process."
