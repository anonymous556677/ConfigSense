    "Reason": "The configuration option 'ALLOWED_SCRIPT_TYPES' is not performance-sensitive. The code snippet provided is responsible for building a list of allowed values for the <script> element's type attribute based on the hints provided. This operation does not involve any time-expensive or memory-expensive operations that would lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The impact of this configuration is limited to the specific functionality that requires the allowed script types, and it does not directly and substantially affect system performance."
