    "Reason": "The 'BACKGROUND_COLOR' configuration option is not performance-sensitive. Although it affects the visual appearance of the transcoded image by setting the background color, it does not involve any time-expensive or memory-expensive operations within its related code. The code snippet related to setting the background color is straightforward and does not lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Therefore, the configuration can be considered as having a trivial performance impact."
