    "Reason": "The MAX_HEIGHT configuration option does not directly and substantially affect system performance at the system level. The code snippet related to the MAX_HEIGHT configuration involves simple conditional checks and basic arithmetic operations to limit the height of an image. These operations are not time-expensive or memory-expensive, and they do not lead to notable performance variations at the system level. Therefore, the configuration can be considered non-performance-sensitive."
