    "Reason": "The configuration option 'QUALITY' is not performance-sensitive. Although it affects the size and quality of the output image, setting the quality value does not directly and substantially impact system performance at the system level. The code snippet related to setting the quality value does not contain any time-expensive or memory-expensive operations that would lead to notable performance variations. Therefore, the 'QUALITY' configuration is not considered performance-sensitive."
