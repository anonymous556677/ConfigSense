    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The 'ALTERNATE_STYLESHEET' configuration option is not performance-sensitive based on the provided code context and developer information. The code snippet provided does not contain any performance-intensive operations that would lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The configuration simply retrieves the alternate style-sheet title from the 'hints' map or falls back to the super class method if not found, which is a straightforward and efficient process. Additionally, the developer's understanding that the impact of this configuration is limited to the functionality related to the alternate style-sheet title further supports the classification of this configuration as not performance-sensitive."
