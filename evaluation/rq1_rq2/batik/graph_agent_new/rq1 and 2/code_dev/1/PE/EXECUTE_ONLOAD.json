    "classification_result": "Yes",
    "Reason": "The 'EXECUTE_ONLOAD' configuration option is performance-sensitive. This is because the option directly affects the behavior of the document during transcoding, specifically in handling dynamic content and dispatching onload events. The code related to this configuration involves building the GVT tree, setting dynamic states, loading scripts, and dispatching events, all of which are time-expensive and memory-expensive operations. These operations can lead to notable performance variations at the system level, making the configuration performance-sensitive."
