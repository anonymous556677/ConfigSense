    "Reason": "The DEFAULT_FONT_FAMILY configuration option is not performance-sensitive. The code snippet provided simply retrieves the default font family from hints and falls back to the super class's default font family if not found. This operation is not time-expensive or memory-expensive, and it does not lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The configuration only impacts the visual appearance of text displayed using the default font family, making it a trivial performance impact."
