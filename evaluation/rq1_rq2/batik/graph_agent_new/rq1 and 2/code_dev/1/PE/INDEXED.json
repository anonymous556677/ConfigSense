    "classification_result": "No",
    "Reason": "The 'INDEXED' configuration option is not performance-sensitive. Although it affects the color depth of the resulting PNG image, the code related to this configuration does not involve any time-expensive or memory-expensive operations that would lead to notable performance variations at the system level. The configuration simply determines the number of colors to be used in the indexed image, which is a trivial impact on performance."
